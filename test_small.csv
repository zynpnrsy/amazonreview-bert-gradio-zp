1,Damaged Product,"The product works fine. I ordered the more exprensive one after I read reviews from others on Amazon. My husband likes the presser. It does a good job pressing his pants. However, it was damaged in the box when we received it. We decided it was too much trouble to send it back. The box was torn and the presser had a chuck knocked out of it."
0,A waste of time and money,"This book is so useless that I feel compelled to write a review to warn others to stay away from this book. A good tutorial should inspire the user on what he/she can do with the product. This book leads you to believe that without talent, the only thing you can do with Illustrator is to draw circles and squares. The book is a disservice to both the reader and to Adobe Illustrator."
0,"Scattered, Out-of-Date,",The authors attempt an ambitious goal of covering many SOA topics - but their resulting text come across as scattered - vague - and lacking a coherent and practical application.Thomas Erl's books are much better written - and have a coherent approch to buliding a solid body of knowledge.For a manager / salesperson wanting a broad overview of SOA - they might be better served by reading Service Oriented Architecture For DummiesService Oriented Architecture For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))
0,Horrible Customer Service & Product,I ordered this product and did recieve then a couple months later it broke. Now Ive done everything I was told to do by by shipping back for a replacement and nothing. They wont return Emails i havent received the replacement part.
0,Is the joke on me?,"I hated this movie. It was so silly. The girl made the cult look more stupid than they already were. Come on? She was from the future??? I can't stop laughing. Maybe, I missed something. I don't think I did. When it first started, I said to myself: What am I watching this for? I thought it was stupid, stupid and then more stupid. I kept watching, trying to make sense of it, but to no avail. I didn't want to waste my $1.00 rental fee."
1,"Good Product, Easy to use",Product was easy to use to assemble.Product supported my weight (180 lb) and was easy to take down. I usually do not have time to work out and this product is great for quick pull up workout.Did notice some scuff marks around the door frame but no damage otherwise.

1,Good product!,"The other plastic garages and service stations that we have purchased in the past were made so poorly, but this one has really stood the test of time with two kids under the age of five."
1,"Hey ""A music fan from California, US ""","Nirvana only got popular after cobain killed himself? Obviously you're an idiot. Nirvana got mega-popular after ""Smells like teen spirit"" was debuted on MTV, and remained popular up until he killed himself. (at which time there was a spike in popularity, yes, but they were popular before).also some of kurt's lyrics are touching if you don't go in with such a bias.Of course I agree with you that Soundgarden sounds nothing like Nirvana, and I generally like soundgarden's music better.I also agree that Kickstand isn't a very strong song on the album, but I love Spoonman. It's one of my favorite tracks.Overall this is an excelent album, with a very intricate and original dark sound to it."
1,One fire...,"Tracy knows how to get you on your feet and dancing! This is an amazing effort from Tracy Young, a must have for everyone!"
0,"A good cable, but not a good value","What matters is using the cable with the highest capability your gear will support (HDMI, DVI, component), and using a decent quality shielded cable. But don't waste your money on ""features"" that won't affect the performance of the cable."
0,"The dreaded ""Remove the Cassette"" message makes this a non starter.","I've used this camera for 6 years. Last year I started getting intermittant ""Remove the Cassette"" messages. I wish I had captured the outstanding three recorded tapes onto my PC then. Instead I recorded another 45 minutes. Now, the error message is solid, no matter which tape I use.My experience with Canon in the past has taught me not to waste the time or the money to bother having this repaired. (I spent about $700 having my previous Canon Camcorder repaired. It worked a few weeks and died again each time.)Having gone to the web to research this bug, I'm convinced fixing this one will be an expensive and time consuming exercise in futility. (6 weeks plus turn around! and Canon won't tell how much the average repair cost is. Check the web .. $500+ )Lesson learned. I'll be shopping a different manufacturer. Sony? JVC? Never again Canon."
1,Works Great,"We make so many awesome things with this dehydrator, including beef jerky, dried bananas, strawberries, apples and we also made fruit roll-ups!"
0,Couldn't finish it,"I was on a plane trying to read this and instead picked up the airline magazine. I typically enjoy books about Irish families but this one didn't develop characters that I could become interested in. After half way through the book, I just gave up. I normally have a hard time not finishing a book but I didn't regret it. The style just wasn't for me."
0,dont buy polaroid products!!!!,i bought FDM-07157 under the cabinet LCD TV in 2006 (DEC). from CIRCUIT CITY who did nothing when the screen went black in april 07. polaroid has the worst customer service i have ever dealt with. cant return it cant fix it. total waste of money!!
0,"Monotonous, Implausible, Convoluted and Confusing","Let Me Call You Sweetheart, by Mary Higgins Clark, read by Bess Armstrong. A convoluted and seemingly implausible tale. Not MHC's best by a long shot, but may have lost a lot in the abridgement, which is pretty awful. Too many characters (and too many of them lawyers!) and the setting jumps between New York or New Jersey -- never quite sure. Finally, Bess Armstrong has a smooth, lovely voice, and excellent pronunciation. But it's kinda like listening to the voice mail lady read you a story, hard to catch the differences in characters, and somehow beautifully read and monotonous too? THE LOTTERY WINNER (read by Edith Bunker!) was a joy to listen to; and The Anastasia Syndrome was a delightfully neat collection - but take a pass on this one."
1,No baby yet.. but still hopeful,I've been using this product for 3 months. It seems to be pretty accurate with my cycle. I gave it 4 stars because they are a little pricey. You must use the monitor along with this which is very expensive too.
1,A tough life,"I liked the book because it is from a true story and the story is fantastic. However, I disliked the book because it has a pattern of Ruth and James and Ruth and James and so on. Finally, I liked the book because it shows you how tough a woman can be in facing her life."
0,Not good,I luv Johanna Lindsey books but this was not good at all.I don't think she was awake when she wrote this. I'm just sad bought
1,"Actually, It's Just the Tip of the Iceberg of Who Joe Is","This second CD of his really helped him boost his career and helped to uplift the spirit of the 1990s. Songs like ""All the Things Your Man Won't Do"", ""No One Else Comes Close"", and ""The Love Scene"" help to bring out his depth in R&B as a singer and performer. Personally, the song ""Good Girls"" describes how I felt for most of my life, including the period that the album came out, so as a whole, I give it 4 stars, and it's definitely worth the time and money spent."
1,Absolutely one of his best!,"Ignore Kavity Killer's one-star review; I don't know what his/her problem is with good ol' Lyle. If you have the slightest interest in Lyle, this disk is a great start. It's about as solid as they come, with a nice mix of upbeat and haunting tunes. Pontiac is my favorite of all of Lyle's disks, with Joshua Judges Ruth being a close second. Try it . . . you'll like it."
1,Great DVD and instant video combo,"I bought this dvd for my wife because she wanted a short, effective workout. Right at the bat, Jillian set the bar high at level 1. It's a continuous cardio, strengthen and abs workout for 20 minutes with 5 minutes of warmup and cool down. My wife saw results within a week. She gave the dvd to her mother so now she's workout on Amazon instant video that came with the dvd purchase. I know this workout works because my sister-in-law shed 10 pounds within 1.5 month and she looks great! Good luck on your workout!"
1,Ruby,It was a nice series. I have read Snelling before and enjoyed her books. Her family connection in the series worked well.
1,Babble fans - 2 Babble songs here,"Just a heads up. Two of the songs on 1000 Fires are Babble tunes. If you are a Babble fan, then you probably want to check this out...."
1,Fun,"My five year old loves his voice changer. In fact everyone in the house plays with it. I like how you can use multiple switches to make even more that 10 different effects. Fun, but if you have a headache or are bothered by noise then do not buy this! haha"
0,Did not work as advertised,"I was overall disappointed with this product, did not see the results and I used it as the label stated. Ended up having to buy another product"
1,Excellent book,"Very outstanding book, helped a ton of things that are just ""assumed"" elsewhere(datasheets, app notes and the like). While it's heavily based in math the book is presented in a very clear way where the math not at the forefront."
1,Concentrates On Tidbits Of Fact Most Of Us Want To Know,"Although it rarely advances too deeply into the lives of the two-hundred individuals featured and I did find a typo or two and the occasional miscued date, the facts presented are always interesting and significant to whom these people were and why they deserve to be remembered today. A very good, informative, light read for a wide audience. Never slow-moving, not over anyone's head, and should prove educational for nearly any reader. Nicely illustrated; well-chosen selection of a cross section of human society throughout time. Worth reading and worth owning. Also makes a good gift choice for the history buff on your shopping list."
1,Great picture!,"I originally had my Xbox 360 hooked up through component but my HDTV only has space for one component connection and I needed to hook up my cable box to it so I decided to purchase the VGA cable. I have an Olevia 232T and I think the image is clearer and brighter through the VGA cable than through component. I know some people complain about ""wash-out"" but I felt the image was much more vibrant and vivid through VGA. If you think the image is too bright, you can always turn down the brightness in the game. Great cable and great picture for the price!"
1,"Finally, a great hole punch","I have been using a terrible hole puncher at school for the past ten years. (hole guide shifting after every punch, a deluge of holes raining upon the classroom floor, fractured palms, etc.) After rejecting the new gold punch, I went on-line to find one that would work. Carl works. If you need some holes punched, I'm the guy to see. This punch smoothly and efficaciously handles 40 sheets - maybe more - with an ease that makes me teary-eyed. Buy it and eat the bill."
0,The price of the product,I was looking to order this product but after reading the reviews there was a change of mind. A 6 pack would have been OK for the price but almost $50.00 for one Garnier is ridiculous. Is this price correct????
1,A World of Earrings,"The book is beautifully illustrated with full color photos that are exceptional in quality. I think it would have been helpful to show how some of the earrings are actually worn, either on a mannequin head or a real person. One other feature I found inconvenient was the location of the descriptive text , which is clear at the back of the book, instead of under or in back of each illustration. The reader has to keep flipping back and forth between the full-sized photo in front and the text at the end. However, it still provides a good general survey of ethnic earrings from Africa, Asia and the Americas."
0,Wish I could give it 0 stars...,Save your money. It is awful and boring and a shame developers even wasted their time on it.
0,Just So So,"This book was disappointing, it only give a sample of Bible prophecy. Plus most of these studies of the are messianic. Also the author spend too much time give references to other Biblical authors - which is not needed. If you are a beginning Bible student this would be okay for you."
1,Great story in a well-worn setting;(post-apocalyptic world.),"I really enjoyed this story as I have others of Ingrid's. The story and the characters remain the meat of the book, instead of incidental 'buy me' sex scenes as so many sci-fi writers (or their publishers) seem to feel are required. There are some good twists to the well-worn setting of a post-apocalyptic world (e.g. the mutations being part of purposeful experiments as opposed to random consequences of the nuclear winter) as well as very interesting character development and story line. However, the ending seemed a little rushed (thus the four stars). Though there were obvious strings left dangling for its sequel(s), too many subplot conflicts were resolved quickly and neatly. Still a great 'read' and I plan to read the sequel!"
0,No support for Mac,"This looks like a fun game with a really reasonable price. Problem is, on my iMac running 10.6.8, the game does not start! Even worse, my requests for help, on their website as suggested, and by email, go ignored. I printed the manual as suggested... no help. I went to their forums as suggested... they were in a language I don't understand. On one help page, someone complains about this issue, and is told to use a wired mouse... no help there, as I'm using a wired mouse. It seems that the hardest puzzle one must solve is how to start the program. The price may have looked reasonable, but I feel ripped off."
0,A Box of Junk,"This set is a box of useless trash. Amazon, you shouldn't allow this sub-quality crap on your site. It is bad for business."
1,This was just what I was looking for!,"I am new to networking and wanted to learn more about security and hacking. I have been especially interested in exploring the hacking world and learning a few neat tricks. This book has made me aware of the methods a hacker uses, and has allowed me to experiment with these methods as well. I found the book to be very valuable for beginner and beyond, but i am now looking for a book that goes even more in depth...if possible.if you want to learn more about hacking and security... buy it! If you already are a pro... you will still benifit by it, but may want to seek something more."
0,Factual Errors in Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar,"I will not go into any details in this first review, but one very important oversight by the editors was the overlooking of the errors in factual information such as dates, names, etc. If a teacher were to use this book in a history class the students would be subject to a wealth of misinformation."
1,Must have,Any Crowes fan must have a copy of this!! I have both VHS and DVD!!! Kind of funny seeing the boys back in the day.
0,Toy never worked properly,"I had a hard time putting the arcade up. I was not pleased with the product, because 3 people was trying to put the game up. We called and called and Toys R us said tha we could not return it, due to fact that we didn't have a reciept. My son was very dissapointed, because that toy was at the top of his Christmas List. We have been advocate toy buyers from Toy's R us for over 20 years. And several times I have been displeased with the service and some of the product sold by the Lansing, IL store, you pay a lot of money for things and find out that the products were not what they appear to be on t.v."
1,A story about kings and knights,"The story's setting takes place in mideavltimes when king Arthur was king. The main charters are king Arthur,Guenever,Gawian,and Lanccalot.I had A report due and my teacher told me that this was A good book to reed.the story is about king Aurthur and his adventuer's with the knights of the round table. It also tells you about how it was to be A knight at the round table.I think it was A good book overall. The book was A good book because it told you about all the knights and what it took to be A knight. The best part of the story was when Gawain died.the worst part of the book was the begining because it wa relly boring.I wold only recemend the book to people whoare in to histoy and mideveltimes"
0,What kind of nonsense is this?,I am not referring to the CD but the review by Herbert S. Philbrick. This guy has heard one track on a radio program and he puts in a 3 star place holder? People make buying desicions based on these reviews. Herbert S. Philbrick needs a dose of responsibility....
0,I cannot believe this was ever released,"If you must hear Bette doing standards go see the movie For The Boys and buy the soundtrack, but this cd is just in bad taste. This is almost as bad as Barry Manilow's Sinatra tribute cd. Midler sings a dozen of clooney's biggest hits and makes them all into trendy pop tunes adding hip hip, and tyechno dance beats, and in so many ways is disrespecting the memory of a laegendary woman. I'm sure bette wishes she could take this back, but it's too late. This cd is not worth hearing once, let alone repeated listenings. This went straight into my waste basket. What a shame Midler might have hired a jazz combo and made a classy effort at tributing Clooney properly instead you have this mess of overproduced comemrcialism. I've never been so disapointed."
1,bumping funk,the title cut is still a Bumping track that will throw your head out of wack in a good way. who took the funk is a banger as well. dug the vocals and overall instrumentation on this set. Grooves are solid on here and Instant Funk is a Band that is slept on.
0,Down with the up rules!,The rules were interpreted - the initial game played. Will probably never play again. You are crossing arms with your opponent to place the drawn tile at the head of their column. It's messy and screws up response times.
0,Useless!,"It's been years since I had a hand-vac, so I spent a lot of time researching the ones available. I decided on this one after reading the reviews, it appeared to be the best candidate for what I needed. Unfortunately, it hasn't been worth the purchase AT ALL! The opening is so small, that anything larger or longer than a cheerio is impossible to pick up. The design of the internal components make it even harder to just keep the debris inside the canister! To top it all off, the device only stays charged for seven minutes according to the manual -- I haven't been able to get it to function well after just a few minutes. There's so many negatives, instead of listing them all -- take my word that this product is a total waste.I've decided to just buy another stand vacuum to keep in place of where we were storing this hand-vac & use the stand vacuum's hose. This hand-vac is a definite inconvenience instead of connivence."
1,excellent read,Loved it. The characters are evolving with each book and I am really beginning to care what happens to them.
1,needle threader,"I love these things, if only I'd stop dropping them because they are hard to find. They are the only needle threaders that work on my serger and they are thin enough to slide into the needle easily. I've collected a lot of similar items but threw them all out."
1,Like Having Your Own Chicken Coop,"It's so nice to have ""eggs"" available whenever you need them. I like to spontaneously bake things, and in the past have been bummed out to find that I've run out of eggs. These dried egg whites keep indefinitely in your pantry, so you never have to go without ""eggs"" again. They are also handy when you create your own pancake or waffle mix in bulk or gift giving. Bob's Red Mill brand is always excellent and I've never been dissappointed."
0,Buyer Beware,"Being desperate for ideas as to what to make my 13 year old son who is on a Candida Diet, I thought I had found a gold mine on discovering this book. I was disappointed, however, when I checked with my naturopath regarding the safety of vegetable glycerin, and was told that it could cause diarrhea and/or dehydration, and he suggested that I look for an alternative sweetener. I have had some success using Ms. Burton's recipes substituting stevia. But thanks for trying, Ms. Burton, for so many of us this is a recurring problem."
0,Worst dealer ever!!,"I ordered a book on March 14 for a birthday present. Today is April 16 and I still have not received the book. I have contacted the dealer twice, but the dealer did not respond to either email. I have also filed a claim because my credit card was charged for the book. If you actually want to buy something at Amazon, do not attempt to buy from Vertex. The worst dealer ever!!Zero stars!"
1,Good for value!!,Good for value!!Its been a month to using it.It works well-Goood!!but it takes time to heat up.
0,DO NOT PURCHASE!!!!!!!,"This tub was such a disappointment. First, it is VERY difficult to use with an infant. My daughter continued to slide down off of the sling because it did not support her. Second, it leaked after the second use. We tried placing a towel under the tub but the towel was completely soaked after about 5 minutes. By the third time the water was gushing out. Also, it is way too big to fit in your standard sinks. I think this is a waste of money and would not recommend this item to anyone. The only reason why I gave it one star is because it would not allow anything lower. I really do not feel that this tub deserves the one star. PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE!!!!!!"
0,"Snubby Revolver: The ECQ, Backup, and Concealed Carry Standard",I found this book to be a waste of time and money. The main focus of the book seemed to be how inadequate the Snubby is for self-defense and I like Snubby revolvers. The author missed or minimized most of the good reasons to carry a revolver other than that they can be lite in weight.
0,Worst playing video I've seen to date.,This review is mainly to warn all of the poor video quality I experenced with the VHS tape by the studio: 'Diamond Entertainment'. The video started out playing so dark I had to set my TV's brightness controls up all the way just to see anything. It also had poor tracing and just overall poor film quality. The DVD version is probably a better bet. I've seen the movie before on 'Mean Guns 20 Movie Pack - DVD' and there the movie looked pretty good. The Movie itself was not bad when seen with a nice quality DVD or maybe another studio's video.
0,"""Device not recognized""","Prospective buyers, beware!I did a lot of research, and finally settled on the Creative Zen Vision:M. I was certainly impressed when it arrived, it is handsome and the player itself is easy to figure out, with gorgeous sample photos and videos to admire as I installed the software.When I finally plugged the ZVM into my PC, an alert came up, ""Device malfunction, not recognized."" Since then, I've spent 12+ hours researching the internet, downloading fixes, firmware updates, driver updates, etc., to no avail. I am an average PC user, but common solutions include meddling around in the registry and completely re-installing windows XP. I haven't been brave enough to do either of those yet.I do believe the ZVM will be fantastic when I get it to communicate with my computer, it has such great reviews. I just want everyone to be aware that mine is a common problem, as demonstrated on Creative's Support website. Don't be dissappointed if it happens to you."
0,Okay.,Although the concept of this book is a great idea I just couldn't get into all that much. It got boring and monotonous quick.
0,Basic and unmoving. Unoriginal.,"With the caliber of musicians playing on this album, I expected a hard hitting original. Instead we get re-arranged covers and lots of ""filler"" salsa. No surprises here. The classic salsa albums are worth your cash but if you are curious, you'll play this one once."
0,Not pratical for learning any useful programming,"I have tried making my way through this book many times. But I cannot get past the author's incessesant penchant for the mayan calendar. I did not find any use in going through code snippets (which are very hard to read, they are screenshots in small font)that taught me how to manipulate dates (leap years, mayan calendars etc.) I found this approach extremely boring. Infusing text with an occasionally comment of marginal wit, does not make it entertaining.The only redeeming portion of this book it that it does include a good introduction to Tkinter. I just wish someone with a better understanding of instructional writing had written it.Like so many other Python books, does every introduction to subjects such as funtions, classes, objects and methods have to be about spam? I know where python got its name...but enough already!"
0,too jazzy,"Gee, this is my first negative review for Chris Rea. Why? Well I expect it is because this cd moved away from what one might associate with Chris Rea....it may be of liking to jazz enthusiasts, but it was too jazzy and mundane for my taste.""Dancing With Strangers"" is a good representation of early Chris Rea (and IMO very good) I would also recommend ""The Blue Cafe"" and ""King Of The Beach"" where you can get many good tunes that are not on his ""best of"" CD's.I am the only negative review, but I think these folks appreciate jazz a bit more than I do. I love the sax as a compliment to music and even though the sax in this cd was done well, it couldn't save this flat and somewhat drab cd."
1,NOT TOO BAD.,"GOOD FOR THE PRICE.IT IS NICE AND USEFUL ESPECIALLY THE BIG BOWL.THE SMALLER ONES ARE O.K ,IT COULD HAVE BEEN A BIT BIGGER."
0,Broken,"Arrived non-functional. Called Motorola who offered to exchange it but they never followed through on sending me return packaging. I ended up needing to resolve the issue through the distributor, who clearly wasn't responsible for it not working."
0,Thoroughly disappointed,"I have seen many craft magazines come and go. I hope this one goes. Granted, there is no commercial advertising in it, but paying anything over $1.98 per issue would be too much. The crafts are mainly useless, juvenile, and lack polish. I purchased my subscription sight unseen because it was through supporting a local school (the only saving grace to this whole experience), but that is a mistake I will not make again. It took at least three months after ordering it that I finally received my first issue. I opened it with great expectation of finding original and practical crafts for my home, but was immediately thoroughly disappointed. Thankfully, my subscription will be expiring soon.If you are a serious crafter, I recommend passing by this one."
0,"Terrible, unprofessional","Very disappointing video. The hostess was pleasant, but the content was useless. One of the tricks was to go fetch. How do you teach that to your dog? Throw the ball and give him a treat when he brings it back. Hello! The dogs doing the demo's couldn't even complete the tricks."
0,could have been alot better,"The funniest pairing was that of the hot young woman with the wrinkly old man. Now THAT had some mileage, but unfortunately, the story departed and you barely even saw the old man again. Classic bait and switch. Overall, kind of an odd movie. Was barely entertaining enough to watch the whole thing through, and if I had it to do over again, probably wouldn't."
0,You get what you pay for...,"Please don't buy these headphones if you are expecting to get a lot of bang for your buck. They cost very little, and therefore have very little quality. I used them for about 2 weeks and stopped. They hurt, the sound is horrible, and they fall apart quickly. If you need some quick headphones to use for a temporary amount of time, then get these. But if you need a good quality pair then trust me, it's worth it to spend the few extra bucks."
1,Great deal,love amazon diaper deal! Huggies are the best and I can afford them when I buy them on here!!!!!!!!!! They are great for lasting multiply hours. Huggies customer service is amazing as well!
0,Disappointing,"I'd been meaning to read this book for a long time, and I realize that it's considered a ""classic"", so I was surprised and disappointed when I finally got around to reading it. Basically, Holt describes various situations where children are playing and learning. If I hadn't already observed the same kinds of things with my own children, maybe this would have been enlightening. If you're someone who's spent time with young children, I don't think you'd get much out of this book. Perhaps if you haven't, then it might be interesting."
0,The box listing does not match what's on the DVDs,"This is either a case of sloppy copyediting or rushing in production. The DVDs do not contain the episodes as listed on the box, which makes finding a certain episode next to impossible. Disappointing."
1,A Classic Resource for the Serious Bible Student,"In addition to the Bible , the four basic key aids for study are a bible atlas, bible dictionary, concordance, and last but not least a good handbook. After some research, it was clear that Halley's was far and away the most revered and trusted. I found most useful the background and history of biblical people and events that which have made the scriptures come alive. I am amazed how he packed so much information in this relatively small volume. Highly Recommended."
1,The dignity of subsistance living,"This is a fascinating look at the story of a Canadian sailor, John MacLennon, who enters deeply into the life of the Chukchi people on the Chukhotka Peninsula in Siberia. John at first is shallow and is repulsed by the Chukchi way of life, but in time marries a native woman and has children with her. He is reborn as a real human being, one who can see the Chukchi as admirable and dignified human beings living in a harsh environment that still provides them with what they need and love.The writing is somewhat flat, but the overall effect is mesmerizing. Read this book if you're interested in native ways seen from the inside. The author is himself a Chukchi and an important political leader as well. The sense of place is overwhelming and the characters are fully drawn."
0,faulty design,"these glasses seemed fine at first and I actually liked them a lot, but after 3 months they have developed some strange layer on the inside surface of the lens. Amazon return period is over. They say they have a life time warranty, but the manufacturer wants to charge me as much as the glasses cost to send me a replacement pair."
0,If I could rate her Less than 1 Star I Would,"Her currently single ""Say How I Feel"" is absolutely nothing like her album.Her album is garbage in my opinion. She doesn't sing to the melody in the music, it's almost like she could have sang the lyrics to some songs to the tune of Old McDonald and it would have sounded the same.An absolute waste of money. This CD is the reason why people download music before they buy. I wish i would have done the same.Don't believe the 4 or 5 star rating. Totally inaccurate."
0,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!,"I have payed an additional $4 in order to get a 24 hours delivery, and it has been more than 26 hours and it still didn't show upTHAT IS THE LAST TIME I'M GOING TO BUY ON AMAZONCREDIBILITY IS CRITICAL"
1,Makes mornings faster!,"This is great for making smoothies in the a.m. I haven't had any problems with it - I use frozen fruit and juice and it works great. The cup is HUGE - I wish it were a bit smaller, say 12 oz. I use this almost every morning and have used it for about 2 mos. and it works fine."
1,"A Good, Solid Recorder","This is my second DVD recorder (the first was a Cyberhome).Many people complain about the Icon system and settings layout on this unit for being hard to understand and confusing. This is true to a point, however, after using it a few times it comes easy (it isnt THAT bad). Do keep in mind however, that DVD recorders are a bit more complex than a VCR. There are many more setting adjustments that you can make. This alone makes ANY DVD recorder a bit harder (at first) to understand ""right out of the box"". As far as quality recordings, this unit does a great job, even at lower speeds, from cable or from a vcr. The Firewire input is a nice touch if you have a digital camcorder."
1,100% INSANITY,"This is quite possibly the most insane game you will ever play on any game console. Use your buckets to catch the bombs. Simple, you say? You won't be saying that when the Mad Bomber starts dropping those bombs at an ever increasing rate (not just in numbers, but also in speed). You have to have excellent reflexes if you want to score big."
0,Really terrible product,"Well, i was so excited when i got the package. inserted the installation disk and i was prompted that installation was blocked due to compatibilty issues. I am running windows 7 ultimate and a microsoft product is incompatible with it. NO SOLUTION AVAILABLE CURRENTLY. What do I do? I am so very upset. Beware of this product."
1,A great game,"This game rules. It's a lot of fun. I'm so bad at it I can't even beat the game on easy and i still love it. Skirmishs are awesome. There are so many different strategies to use, you'll probaly never figure out all of them. And the expansion packs make it even better(I suggest aftermath, which you can get with the regular game in the arsenal package, But I hear counterstrike is decent also.) I also haer that it is cool to play on the internet, but i've never got that mode to work. The only domnside is you can't play skirmishs. But at this point, I wouldent buy. You will probaly start to play, Love it, Play it alot, Get the new one in october, and throw out the old one. This is a great game, But i suggest you wait for the new one."
1,: ),"great story! the characters had great, rich personalities. the only problem with this book was the way it was told. ""but dear reader."" just get on with the story already! other than that, it was a great story that's too good to forget."
1,Compressorless Nailing,"Great product for people that don't want to haul a compressor around in order to use a nailer. Make sure you have a good electrical connection though, the lights dim when you fire the nailer."
1,The Best Book I Ever Read,"I saw that the average rating for this book was 4 and a half stars and I had to write a review. This is the best trilogly I have ever read. The plot and story are wonderfully complex. Phillip Pullman is a wonderful author and has written this trilogy magnificantly. I must say that the beginnings are a little slow and dull but hang in there, it's worth it. It also might seem a bit confusing for some but it all comes together. I absolutly love this trilogy. It is hard to put in words my joy when reading it. I would recommend this book to anyone, young or old, which I have. The story only gets better and better with each book. I am just in awe to how Phillip Pullman thought up and wrote this intricate tale. It is filled with so many wonderful surprises and twists it is impossible not to love. Take my advice and read this trilogy, you definitely won't regret it."
1,A Civilians Opinion,The book kept me intrigued from beginning to end. I don't think I would have found this book on any book shelf let alone read it without me being asked to read the book. The book opened my eyes to the Iraq War. From the beginning to the end the journal entries kept me turning the pages. Read the book find out about the daily life of a army journalist/solider.
1,Necessity,It helps to use the system for people that do not play games on the PS3 because all the buttons are like a standard blue-ray/dvd player. Easy to link up (1 minute) and batteries last a long time.
1,Principles of Database Systems,This book does a wonderful job explaining database systems using Java. I have read many books on the subject and this is the best one I have found.
0,Not a standout in any way,"The characters go through their motions but it just doesn't meet the standards established by other police dramas. For stories and acting that will keep you looking at the screen rather than at your watch, try The Shield, Law and Order, Foyle's War and A Touch of Frost."
0,Such a fun DVD but ours was loaded with skips,"Too bad the quality of this DVD was so bad. It was loaded with skippps. We are exchanging it, hope the new one is better. Otherwise, what a terrific fun DVD for a dancing girl."
0,Better than Hatebreed?!,"Whoever said this band is better than Hatebreed is way off. These herbs don't even come close. Don't waste your money. Jersey has the worst ""hardcore"" bands ever."
0,its ok,nothing special i would recommend spending more money on the other desk mats this thing is kind of weak looking
1,Better Safe Than Sorry,"I've used several carbon monoxide alarms from First Alert for the past couple of years. Sadly, I was very dissapointed with the fact that they've shorted out after only a few months. For Kidde, they've made high quality carbon monoxide alarms, but also a very convient prices. The Kidde KN-COBB Basic Carbin Monoxide Alarm is a very simple and easy to setup alarm. This alrm is very affordable, and you can easily hang it up, without any problems. It is also easy to install the batteries, unlike those that require a 9 Volt batteries. Here, all it takes is a trio of AA batteries, and it works better, even during a power outage. Kidde does show it, and I really suggest you have one for your everyday houselhold.Price: B 1/2+Setup: B+Convience: BOverall: B"
1,Excellent,"Well done, feel good, and extremely realistic. Sami potrayed the character well. Another great french film."
0,Not Like New,"I ordered a paperback copy of this book which was supposed to be ""like new"". The book I received was a hardcover copy not to mention that the book was pulling away from its binding."
1,Go-to breakfast food,"I eat oat bran cereal almost every morning for breakfast. This was a great deal, and a convenient way to purchase it."
1,season 6 lost,"we are addicted to LOST...silly as it is. we were getting the discs on netflix, but season 6 was not out yet. after purchasing a roku box, which came with a $certificate for amazon VOD....i was able to purchase season 6 for a great price. ahhhh, no waiting for netflix to acquire rights. LOST is very well done for a tv show.....but it is an addiction."
1,A hilarious how-to,"What a gloriously funny book! Even the recipies were funny, and well, how funny did you think a recipie could be?! I ""discovered"" this book en route to Jamaica back in May--the stranger next to me read it all the way there. Well, the cover just grabbed me and I HAD to have it. It was a quick, light read that had a very wise and uplifting last chapter. Oh, and for those who are clueless like me in the beginning, this is not a fiction novel, but a wacky manual about life, love and other good stuff that we should all follow to the hilt!"
0,Harman Kardon managed to produce a flop,"If you want Harman Kardon receivers it's ok. Even most of the DVD's. I own a 22 and a 31 and I also got this one which is really annoying.Issues:- it does not save caption settings- it does not save video settings; even after I set it up to be 16:9 1080i default it always reverted to 720p.- after a period of time the DVD unit itself refused to read discsI returned to HK, got a replacement and I'm testing it to see if there are any improvements, but... I think this is unacceptable for HK. After all I did not buy an 80$ Sony, and if I bought HK I bought it for the name which supposedley means quality."
0,Memory Card Error,"Same problems as everybody else. 14 months after purchase it ate the card. Tried 2 different cards, no dice for either. From love to hate. Dang. Also Canon's support website/acknowledgement of this problem is non-existent. It was hard enough to navigate their site, but it's impossible to find anything relevant."
0,The lenses scratch easily,I can be tough on safety glasses so it may be no fault of the mfg but IMO the lenses scuffed and scratched rather quickly.
1,Awesome knife for the price!,"Love the quick drawing action, works beautifully! Great knife at a great price. Get you one son!"
0,YUCK,"I have become a fast fan of Mustela products for my 3 year old who suffers from eczema. This is the first Mustella product that fell short for me. I started with bath oils, shampoo & conditioner, massage oil, and lotion; all of which smell pleasant & light if not good, and seem to work well on his skin... I bought these wipes to keep to clean his hands on the go, but the smell is obnoxious. It is so strong, and gross. I was trying to scrub the smell off my hands when I felt compelled to leave a review. Going to find another alternative."
1,A touching story,"I would like to recommend Different Flags. It is the story of Ani, a young american woman who feels that her life is going nowhere. She goes to Argentina to meet her aunt and then her life changes a lot! When I was reading the book I was touched by Renskoff's marvellous way of communicate feelings and then I asked myself 'How many Anies are there in the world?' I think this book can open some minds. At Different Flags, you will find GREAT descriptions of places, characters feelings and ways of living in Argentina."
0,Difficult to read,"I feel this book is poorly written. It needed to be proof read before printing. It was, for sure, not worth the $20. The facts about the polygamists' every day life, & struggles, are very educational, & sad, but there are so many grammatical errors that I had to reread sections for them to make sense. I found myself correcting grammar, instead of taking in the subject matter. I doubt I will be purchasing any more books from this publisher."
0,A very boring read,"I understand that if you are young and in jail, as was Sade, you can dream all kinds of sexual fantasies. The dreams of the marquis de Sade belong to that category. However these dreams are not edited: this is not literature, it is repetitive and frankly not exciting at all for a normal person. Out of jail, Sade had a disorderly life, attacking his young servants and being, even for a 18th century nobleman,- at that time, noble people could get away with a lot of sins- absolutely repugnant. We remember Sade because he gave his name to a type of disorder, but he is forgettable as a character and as an author. It is hard to believe that the monster was born in the south of France in the beautiful and charming city of Lacoste. The castle belongs now to Pierre Cardin estate and half the town is an art school."
0,Broken twice!,"We received these cups (which are very nice heavy metal), and the handle was detached from the largest size. We ordered replacements and the second set also had the handle detached. Apparently the method of attaching the handles is inadequate for the job."
0,Bobby Heenan DVD,"Another WWE stinker!!!! No comments from the ""Brain"" himself, who was one of the funniest men in the history of wrestling. Barely any snippets of his comedy, just poorly done. I won't be wasting any more of my money on WWE dvds."
0,No you cant !,"A good primer on analysis, moving averages, and cheap vs. expensive. There is a major hole in this book: When is it time to sell? You will find no analysis. Ben and Phil only make the case for when to enter a position in a S&P500; index fund, and when to avoid adding to the position. When the indicator suggests stocks are high, buy t-bills until the indicator changes.If you use one of the timing indicators to put money in, what about taking it out, thereby avoiding a ""reversion to the mean""? If you are only timing an entry and not an exit, you aren't timing... So in my opinion, NO you can't time the market (not by reading this book)."
1,100 star rating,"This is jazz guitar period. Even if you are slightly interested in great music that swings, pick this one up quick....before it's too late."
1,How can you not like this book???,"i loved this book! im currently on holiday and ive only got the first in the series and im dying to read more of this masterful writing! the only problem id have with this book is that it ends with no temporary ending!this only makes me desperate to read the rest of the quartet. the characters are genuniely likeable and though some stages in the book are a bit slow or repetative you just have to perservere to get to the real highlights of the book!since it is a little slow at times i will give this book a 4.5, since its not brilliant but most books aren't perfect, but this book is definitly up in the top range!"
1,"Great Game, Good Graphics","This game is great. I play at Very High detail and High on that other question. The graphics are good, the game has good mission builds, great weapon sounds (especially the Thompson) and some-what good AIs. If you have the graphics to support the game, the game is great. Most people just don't like the game because their computers can't run it. My advice is to buy this game. You will get enjoyment out of it. Also, make sure you have everything the game needs and maybe more so you can play on higher texture and detail. The campaign is very short, though."
0,A Little Disappointed,"I actually purchased the CD because it was ""Gladys Knight"" and gospel music, but prior to opening it I decided to listen to the sample tracks and check out the reviews. Boy am I glad that I did! I really thought that Gladys was the featured artist on the whole CD, not so, she is only singing on a few of the tracks. I liked a few of the selections but not enough to keep the CD. Since the CD has not been opened, looks like this one will be going back to the store. Sorry Gladys. I also heard that Kurt Karr produced this one, so now I'm really dissappointed!"
1,Scene It- Friends Version,"Our family love watching ""Friends"" so this game was perfect for our teenagers as a gift for Christmas!Amazon had the item, when most retailers were sold out close to the holidays.I would recommend it, along with the other versions of ""Scene It"", which are fun and entertaining trivia for the entire family of any age."
1,Comfortable but big,"First: Huge thanks to all the reviewers who let us know to order a smaller size than we usually wear. I am a size 8 but, based on the other reviews, I bought these in the 6.5-7.5 size and they still feel slightly big. The size 8-9 would no doubt have been un-wearable.For years I've worn the ballet-style slippers, very lightweight, machine wash and dry. Lately my aching feet have been demanding some cushion and the Acorns are obviously highly recommended for that. They're not lying. These things are definitely like little pillows under my feet and I love that.It's just unfortunate that the sizing is so off. Even with the smaller size, they slip a little on my heel when I walk which is mildly annoying. With true sizing, I would have given these five stars, but I'm still granting four stars for being the most comfortable things I have ever had on my feet."
0,Doesn't work with mac snow leopard,"Months after Snow Leopard was released I can't use this expensive printer. This response from Dymo support on December 30, 2009: ""Unfortunately, LabelWriter [330] that you have (model 90792) is not supported with snow leopard. We currently have an upgrade program for existing LabelWriter printer owners giving you 20% off of our list price for any of our currently sold LabelWriter printers.""They want me to buy another very expensive label printer because they aren't interested in keeping their drivers up to date. Companies like this should be avoided. The very expensive Dymo label printer you buy today may no longer be supported in a few years! BEWARE."
1,Gold amidst the dross,"Barbara Sherrod doesn't churn out as many books per annum as some of the other Signet authors, and it shows. Her books are amusing, correct, tight little idiosyncratic worlds. This is the closest you'll get to a contemporary Georgette Heyer for wit and style and unique, endearing, intriguing characters. Try her older Regencies published by Harlequin under the name Barbara Neil. Her style is so disinctive that I recognised her even under a new name with a new publisher after I had been several years away from the genre. This particular book is one of her best - the hero and heroine are eminently likeable and a cast of eccentric minor characters keep the plot rolling and provide comic relief. The dialogue is fabulous, the plot is coherent and pacey. Buy it now because you won't be able to get it when it goes out of print - it's a keeper and won't make it to the second-hand bookshops."
0,Child Killer,"She's a harpie, a liar, a thief, and a mass murderer of police, soldiers, and children. Anyone who buys this book, or sells it, is helping the NRA murder more children and police. She's also helping the Bush traitors lie to and kill our soldiers in Iraq, our heroes. And the unconscionable comments she's made about the 911 widows....The list of atrocities goes on. DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!"
1,My muscles ACTUALLY grew from reading it.,JK but yeah very helpful in understanding the important basics and biology of what I do every day. I got my money's worth.
0,"Mislead by ""digital copy"" language","The movie is cute, and the DVD is fine, but I purchased this for the digital copy. Shame on Sony for the deceptive packaging."
0,"CURTIS BERNHARDT, OPUS 30",**1/2 The title of the film refers to the walls of the county asylum and to the hero's amnesia. Medical students may find attractive this ode to the benefits of Pentothal but certainly not amateurs of film noir. However I liked Herbert Marshall and his lassitude. Already forgotten.
1,Fiddler on the Roof,"An absolute classic, everyone should own this movie.Literal laughs and tears story."
0,Waste of my hard earned money!,"Gave it one star because that's the lowest you can go. This book may be useful if you've never turned on a computer before in your life, or if you had a hard time getting through the reading in high school, but otherwise it does not offer any great insights or new ideas. The bottom line is that it's probably quicker to stumble through tasks on your own than read the book and you'll end up doing things the most efficient way anyway. Don't waste your money. Borrow one if you're forced to by a teacher, but don't spend your own money!"
0,Great....When Working!,"I bought this blender for X-mas and all went well for about a month until this evening. When I went to turn the blender on--nothing happened! It won't turn on and I have absolutely no clue why. I was shocked to say the least.I'm not sure if I even want to contact Braun's customer service because of all the negative feedback with them.Note to self, cheap equipment is crap equipment..."
0,Some Relevant Details,"I wanted to point out a few things that weren't clear when I bought these weights:1. Each band is equipped with removable weights (2 1lb bars each) so you can lighten them if you need. However, the inserts are not made of sand, but of metal, and are very hard and can bruise your ankle bone if you leave them in.2. The box says that these are NOT to be used for running or walking.3. They are too big for me, I'm a size 4 female with small ankles and I positively swim in these. So be wary if you want them to fit snugly.My rating is partly based on disappointment, I bought these because I thought as they were designed for women they would be small enough to fit me, or at least adjustable. And I thought I could use them for hiking."
1,The Wizard of Seattle by Kay Hooper,For a short story fiction book I thought it quite fun and a great little read. This book would be great for a cold rainey day to curl up with. I really enjoyed it!
1,Grand Theft Auto Stole My Eye,"I Played Grand Theft Auto 2 And It Is The Coolest Game Since Pong. The High Definition Levels And The Graphics Make This My Pick Of The Year. The Most Fun Is Getting To Grab Any Car You Want And Getting To Fight For Respect In Gangs. With 3 Levels And 75 Missions, This Game Will Steal You Too."

0,"It was Ok, but not great","I thought this movie was going to be great; The reviews and critics all agreed it was the best movie. And the new director was supposed to be one of the best.I was very disapointed.First of all, let me explain that I love the whole series and the last two movies. However, this movie was not very good. It hardly followed the story line, and it hardly explained anything. Oh, the acting was great, but the director and writer slipped in some unnecessary things, such as a budding romance between Harry and Hermione. (...)Another thing I found irritating was the complete change of the Hogwarts grounds. Not only had the castle changed its shape, but the forest and Hagrids hut had both relocated themselves.Other than those *few minor errors* it was great. I love Daniel Radcliffe and his acting."
1,"Great series, good price, no booklet",This is a great addition to anyone's Star Wars collection. All episodes were inspired by the films and addtional characters or scenes had to be approvied by George Lucas himself. This isn't just a cartoon for kids but can be for anyone who enjoyed the Star Wars films. Since Star Wars films are so expensive to produce and create and there is so much story to tell it only makes sense to have a cartoon series address different story lines. Be cautious when purchasing this exact product. Other reviews suggest that this 4 disc DVD version comes with a 60 something page booklet. It does not. I'm not sure if the blu-ray or other versions of this season do. It's worth the price for the entire season regardless. Unless Disney makes some drastic changes in accessibility and marketing then it will probably be awhile before you see this show available for streaming (ie. Netflix.)
0,We've heard it all before,"I have read all of the CWG books, and must say that I did not find anything in there that I had not read or heard before. I found it interesting that traditional ideas which have stood the test of time were casually dismissed, while every new-age idea was endorsed and embraced (with the exception of pyramid power-I did not see that in his books I must confess.) The author is well versed in eastern religions and metaphysical thought. His ideas are thought worthy, but I feel I must caution readers who are seekers not to accept everything in this book as ""Truth."" Mr. Walsch does admit that he is an imperfect ""filter."""
1,Cloud of Sparrows is a great first novel.,"This is a very good read. I was very impressed with the quality of this book. I grew quickly attached to the charcters and found the story to be captivating. Some compared it to Shogun, and I have found the comparission to be a good one. While not as grand as Shogun the story and the charcters are so exceptional that I found myself thinking it may be a better book in many ways. I am highly anticipating the sequel Autumn Bridge which was recently released."
1,"Foyle's War, Simply the Best",Foyle's War is simply one of the best of the numerous British mystery series produced. As a fan of the genre I feel this is one of my all time top three series. Michael Kitchen is superb.
0,2 inches short,"I ordered the 18 inch chain for a pendant I received from a friend. While it is nice looking, the chain including the clasp was actually only 16 inches long. While the shipping was fast, I did contact the company about the length of this chain and have received no response from them in the 3 days since I've received the order and contacted them. As someone with a 15 inch neck, a 16 inch chain is a little close for comfort."
1,"Simply...is Phil, and is great.","I am not a Huge Phil Collins fan but i do like the man, not only as a singer but also as a composer, the guy is a great musician. This cd is really good when you have not a lot of space in your glove compartment for more discs and you want Phil to sound loud as you cruise around, or simply to relax back home. Is great music, full of musicianship and soul, recommended."
0,This unit doesn't have a grounding point...,Ran around trying to ground the turntable... thought this thing came with an input for grounding my turntable because some other mini-preamps made by the same company do. Boo.
1,Two Voices,I purchased this book so I could use it with my students. They have been using two voices to perform each story. They really enjoy it and they are FIFTH graders!
0,"Great at first, then really bad. As in not-even-working-at-all bad.","This battery was inexpensive and worked really well at first. As other reviewers have mentioned, it's not the exact color of the PowerBook G4 body, but that doesn't matter.I enjoyed the long battery life for about the first three weeks, but then it went from 100% capacity to 92% capacity almost overnight.Then, yesterday, it stopped taking a charge while my Mac was plugged in. There was nothing wrong with my power cords or the Mac itself--it charged my older battery fine this morning. But this product will not charge.I'll be returning it."
0,How to destroy a piano,"The Rach 3 has been my favorite piano concerto since the first time I heard it. (I own 7 different recordings.) I am a pianist myself and have taught piano for decades. The only interpretation I do not like is the one played by Cliburn. I don't know what happened to him between the time he won the Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow and the present. He played the Tchaikovsky beautifully, but to my mind, never played as well again. I use his recording to illustrate to my students what really awful playing sounds like. To quote a critic from the Seattle Post Intelligencer (years ago), ""He played as if he were trying to destroy the instrument."" There is no tenderness, no sensitivity, no quality of tone. I just plain didn't like it."
0,I don't get it. This was totally waste of money.,"I'm really disappointed with this video. the song style is like 60s to 80s that tots never understand the wits or anything. My daughter really loves to watch wiggles but not this one.It's really boring except Dr. knickerboker song. and Sam Moran... He really sings well but I miss Greg. Still, I don't get the picture of 4 wiggles without Greg.Anyway, don't buy this dvd."
0,It's Awful,"I'm a gadgeteer. I play with all kinds of digital and electronics equipment. I'm an amateur radio operator, I write web pages, I run a large corporate network but I can't make this work satisfactorily. I have to agree with Joel's review. While the concept is solid, this unit just does not provide clear audio. I've got it plugged in to my computer right now and can't get a clear signal from any radio in the vacinity. Moving the TuneCast causes alternating static. Just don't buy this, find a better device to do this task."
1,Gotta go!,"This is really compact and comes with 3 bags to get you started as well as a plastic carrying bag. We haven't used it yet, but I put the 3 bags on it and have it stored in the carry bag in the car. This is small enough for a diaper bag or under the stroller. Really great idea for potty training and young children who can't ""hold it"" for very long."
0,Very bad book,"This is not a book. It is a manual for the code the author has writen.The code is in .p format, not in .m format. So it doesn not let to learn anything.A very bad book. It is just a software manual"
1,The Craft & Art of Bamboo,"Anyone who is interested in bamboo will want The Craft & Art of Bamboo by Carol Stangler readily at hand! She looked North and South, East and West for her resources and inspirations. And she knew who to include, some of the greats in the field of working with bamboo -- among them, David Flanagan (the Bamboo Fencer), Yucatan Bamboo, and Doug Lingen and Reed Hamilton of the Bamboosmiths. The reader may not need or be attracted to each project (with 30 in all, she offers a BIG range to choose from!), but there is a great deal of information to be gleaned from each one. The chapters on harvesting and tools alone are sufficiently full of information to make the very reasonable purchase price worthwhile. This would be a great gift, for yourself or for any woodworker-crafter."
1,Good for electronics storage,"I got this to store electronics in - it's a pretty good deal. The picture doesn't show that the tackle box comes with a fold down door in the front, which I might remove because it's kind of annoying."
0,"Despicable, Disrespectful, Clueless","This book - and Michael Harner - are a horrifically bad joke. A true shaman does NOT teach shamanism to the masses in workshops, and for exorbitant amounts, I might add. One is called by Spirit to be a shaman, and if one is called, one spends the rest of one's life in service, FOR FREE. I won't go on, because the rest of the negative reviewers have pretty much said it all. This man should be ashamed."
1,Best Superhero Movie Ever!! It's a masterpiece.,"I knew that this movie would kill at the box office. One of the best movies i have seen. I went to see it with my 2 bros and it was packed in the theater. We couldn't even sit together. I knew Heath Ledger would get nominated and win the Oscar for his fantastic portrayal of the Joker after seeing it. It has a great cast but, Heath does steal the show. It was an easy decision for me what I was going to be for that halloween I'll tell ya that much. I was never really a big fan of Heath before it and I had seen a couple of his movies. It was shocking to hear he passed away after finishing the movie. At least he left with a Big Bang. It is also much more than just a superhero movie I really don't even see it as one. The movie has it all drama, action, comedy, romance. It has something for everyone and the movie is just one of the greats."
1,"Beautifully Written, Beautifully Illustrated","Really, they should have a separate scale for Robin McKinley. _The Stone Fey_ is vividly written and illustrated, capturing one's imagination in the first page. It's particularly well suited for reading aloud &/or for a ""coffee table book"" -- eye catching, ear enthralling, and a dang good story."

0,Not as good as my previous model,"My first littermaid device lasted about 10 years. It was excellent and I recommended it highly to others.I was really excited to get what I thought was the new and improved model. I think the new design is much cheaper and doesn't work 1/2 as well. The litter keeps getting stuck in the grates on one side and I'm not finding it cleans and rakes the clumps as well at all. I have tried using more and less litter to see if anything makes a difference.I would prefer it if they brought back the original version of this device. For $200, I am disappointed and frustrated with this latest model."
1,Funny and silly,"I read this book to a group of preschool children at storytime at our local Zoo. When I first read it to myself, I thought it was a rather silly book, but the children thought it was wonderful and couldn't stop laughing. I would recommend it."
0,so-so easy to put down and pick up weeks later,"Easy to put down and pick up again weeks later. Not enough stuff about other things going on other than what the main characters do in bed, how boring!"
1,Buy this now!,"Very attractive, solid and sturdy, materials are very well organized. Not the cheapest, but well worth it -- especially at the discount Amazon provides... And then there's the content -- top notch stuff, perfect."
0,"Nice & comfy, until they break","I would have rated these as a 4 or 5 until they broke. It turns out the speaker assemblies are held to the headband by a single tiny screw and a low-grade plastic cap. Seriously AKG? They're still under warranty, but what a disappointment.Otherwise, they are very comfortable; I could wear these for hours & hours. The tradeoff is that they are a little loose - I had trouble keeping them in place when playing drums, but great for sitting in front of a computer.I replaced the AKGs with some Audio-Technicas which are louder, still quite comfy and seem to be of much more substantial construction.Update: Attempting to get service with AKG/Harmon under warranty.

1,Excellent product,"I use the Linksys WRT150N Wireless N Router at home with my PS3 and 2 computers. I use the Linksys WUSB300N Wireless-N USB Network Adapter (the item being reviewed) with my desktop since the router is in a different room and I don't want to run cables. I have a wireless G card for my laptop, but I switch to the USB adapter when I'm not using it on my desktop because it gets a much stronger signal and faster downloads than the card. In short, I love it. Being on a USB cable and having a stand, you can either plug it directly into the computer, or set it a little bit away from the computer for better positioning."
0,Not an introduction.,"I disagree that this book is a good introduction to sendmail. It does not cover the basic options well, and very quickly goes off the deep end of the sendmail.cf file. It is probably a very good introduction to the advanced sendmail.cf programming that most people will never need to do.It barely mentions how to create sendmail.cf using the m4 macro processor. It doesn't cover virtual hosting well, but spends pages and pages on uucp and decnet mail. And ,it is unix-centric to the point of assuming that all users will be on unix boxes with their own properly configured hostname and sendmail, rather than on DHCPed PCs down the hall (which seems to be the current situation).All in all, this book told me little of nothing about the sendmail tasks I have to accomplish and way too much about stuff I should never have to touch."
0,tacky and pointless,"I checked this book out of the library rather than buying it, thankfully. Virtually every pattern in this cheesy book is available on the author's (equally cheesy) website for FREE, with links to buy materials to make the projects directly from the author. How genius. The information in this book is so fundamental that it is laughable, and easily available for free on the internet with minimal effort. This is just a really dumb book."
0,Redundant and short,"Having just seen Samsara, Baraka, and Koyaanasquatsi again I would say you can choose any of the others and get the experience. There is only so many hours of people moving fast, going up and down elevators, coming out of subways, automation, cars stopping and going, slow motion or fast motion of similar scenary, slaughterhouses, etc before you say he is plagiarizing himself. The video quality is deplorable by the way and 42 minutes is a rip-off. So pick one and you can skip the others unless you are a fan of time lapse films."
1,Great way to start the day,This is an easy read and the devotions are easily applied to every day life. I use the app on my iPad for inspiration to start my day.
1,No more melted plug wires,I needed a good plug that was a little shorter to keep the plug wires off the headers. They did just that and are a great plug.
0,"Wheres ""Do Whatcha Gotta Do""","This is a very comprehensive review of Four Tops ""cuts' what I simply can't understand is why none of these 'Hit Lists' do not include what I believe to be one their greatest, Jimmy Webbs, Do Whatcha Gotta Do! Other than this terrific song I love the rest of the Boxed set immenesly"
0,rather bland,"i had such high hopes for this album, i really did. after hearing ""stupify"" and ""voices"" i was convinced that these guys had talent. then i borrowed their album and i was seriously disappointed. ""droppin plates"" is atrocious, im sorry but its true. they seem to have a pretty good idea of what they want to do but theyve conveyed themselves quite badly by trying to seem ""kooky"" and ""original"". their singer makes far too many stupid noises and should be concentrating more on his singing abilities, which (when he gets it right) are very very good.the musicianship seems very 2 dimensional also, i often thought ""ive heard that before"" quite a few times, especially on ""Down With The Sickness"".anyway i'll stop slagging this album now and wait for them to come do a show over here, as live the music will probably sound one hell of a lot better."
0,NOT NECESSARY TO BUY,"If you have the Baby Bargain book by Alan & Denise Fields, YOU REALLY DON'T NEED THIS BOOK. First, it's not as detail as Baby Bargain. Second, the information seems to be outdated because (1) copyright is 2000 and (2)I send in for some info. per author's instruction and I got a return to sender with NO FORWARDING ADDRESS. Third, these type of books should be updated annually since we are looking for the latest information. Companies form, merge, and go bankrupt annually. If the information is not updated, how is it a good guide? I got the book because of all the five stars review I read."
0,Do not buy,"THIS IS NOT ""ROYAL HERITAGE HOME BRAND"" THIS SET IS VERY THIN AND NOT EVEN WORTH THE DISCOUNTED PRICE. BEWARE OF ANYONE ON AMAZON SELLING SHEETS THAT CLAIM TO BE ROYAL HERITAGE HOME."
1,Great CD's,Bought this CD set for my wife for Christmas and we both enjoy falling to sleep to the sounds. No music. Just the sounds of nature. I highly recommend this set. A really good bargain too!
0,Movie jumped all over the place,"I am returning the Vol. I movie, Heidi, movie was terrible; movie jumped all over the place throughout the entire movie. I am returning for another one that hopefully works. These should be checked out before they are sent. I had wanted it for a XMas gift for my daughter; good thing I looked at it first. I am very disappointed. I hope the next one works."
1,Jeff's Been Pretty Prolific - Another new album in 3 years!,"I first got tuned in and turned on to Jeff Beck with his ""Who Else?"" cd, which in my personal opinion is the best. But this newest offering is a good mix of sounds and rhythms, and Jeff is experimenting with alot of interesting styles and sounds. I would just as soon that he keep it instrumental as opposed to including vocals on his stuff. His style is unmistakeable and strong enough to hold its own without the help of anyone singing.. This is good.. but ""Who Else?"" is really choice!"
1,Worth it for the video,"This single isn't quite as fun as Crying At The Discoteque or Don't You Want Me. Whereas those other singles have better beats, Sexual Guarantee is a bit slower. And there are only two tracks on the disc. But it's still well worth the purchase, because the bonus video for Crying At The Discoteque is, well, odd and fascinating. If you like Alcazar (or Army of Lovers, Vacuum, etc.) you'll appreciate its weirdness and treasure it as an addition to your QuickTime video collection."
1,Beauty and the Beat,"Deborah Bonham, sister of the late great John ""Bonzo"" Bonham of Led Zeppelin, stirs emotion and excitement in ""Old Hyde"". Her voice is amazing and powerful.Her band is great! The title song is sure to stir a tear or two...definitely worth a listen to...Hope to see her in Canada soon...Truly fantastic!"
1,Karin Fossum is my new favorite Nordic author.,"Steig got me started, Nesbo was next and now I have moved on to Karin Fossum. I find these 3 authors so much better than the average mystery writers. Their stories are tight, fast paced and I'm rarely able to guess the killer."
1,The Devil's Advocate Lived any good books lately? You will.,"This is one of the greatest things to come along since sliced bread. It captures the essence of all that is evil in the world. Without using vampires, werewolves, or other creatures, this book captivates its audience with an apocolyptic account of what very well may occur in the future. This book puts life into focus and deals with some very strong issues. If this one does not leave you saying, ""that was awesome,"" then something is wrong with you. Highly recommended. This book is not for the timid."
0,Forget noise cancelation !,"I just got them today. It does not cancel anything! It can't even cancel low noise of pc while working (ventilation, hd, typing). Don't even wanna talk about cancelation of noise while someone is watching tv, typing, phone ringing. 0%. null, nothing. When you turn them on, it only amplifies the sound, and amplification works even with total silence, so amplification is not result of noise reduction !Headphones should be renamed to ""amplified headphones""."
0,CRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP!!!!,This movie was nothing but rubbish - it went absolutely nowhere. It wasn't even funny - I hardly got a chuckle at most.I agree with everything the other people have said that have given this movie a 1-star rating.DO NOT make the same mistake as me and buy this DVD - rent it first if you REALLY want to waste 2 hours of your time...
0,Order with caution,"I ordered this movie from Amazon and it was greatly anticipated by my husband as a gift from me. He remembers it as a very good movie. However, we found we could not play it because this DVD can only be played in ""Play Only"" devices and may not be played in other DVD devices, including recorders and PC devices. This mistake was mine because I didn't read enough of the fine print before ordering. We've returned it and will try to re-order one that will play on our system. (Be aware of this before ordering!) Otherwise, as always before, it arrived in the condition and timeframe expected. We've found Amazon's customer service to be very helpful, efficient and fast."
1,Harvet,I nice boy meets boy wrestles with attraction and sexuality. The film is handled in a common German way. There small bits of plot and then cut aways to pasture/still scenery. Harvest doesn't finish with a complete story but leaves you to consider where the story might go from that point.
1,A must read for 2009,"To all citizens of America, this is a MUST read book. You need to see how this country was led by a man of character because we certainly do not have it in the current group in Washington DC.Peggy Noonan does her usual stellar job of bringing Reagan's words and deeds to life. She crafts her stories about Reagan in such a way as to make you feel you know him on the same level she was!"
1,A very helpful book.,This book offers hope for those with chronic health problems. The book is very specific and detailed about what is and is not recommended to eat. Lots of recipes are included.
1,picstic,i really needed one of these as i am home bound. Ity comes in handy for picking things up off the floor and getting some of those things that are stored too high its a well built piece of equipment that i use quite a bit
0,The worst of this series!! Save your money!,"I have been so let down by this book. I was hoping for so much more for ""C"". The romance just wasnt there. Just skip this book and continue with the rest of the series. Save your money!!! Not worth it!!"
1,Good Album You Need This,"I was really feeling this album. I think that they have some good features and some great tracks as well. I'm really feeling the guy with the high pitch voice, and the other guy is cool as well. The songs that stand out to me are Rap Life, Hip-Hop, and a couple others. The great thing about this album was seeing Cool Nutz from Portland on there, as well as Equipto. I would go ahead and grab this album and add it to your collection. I heard Potluck on the Collabos album from Cool Nutz and it sparked my interest."
0,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"DESPITE READING THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS, I BOUGHT IT ANYWAY. THE WEIGHT PART WAS OK, BUT I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE AEROBICS PART OF THE TAPE. DANCE STEPS TOO HARD TO FOLLOW, CAMERA ANGLES BAD. BORING...TO MUCH YELLING IN BACKGROUND."
1,"Love It, Love It, Love It !!!",Purchased this in Jan 2011. Am currently in my 4th week of the program and very impresseed thus far. I did read the reviews before purchasing and confirmed I could pass the fitness test (great look by the other reviewers). Already seeing and feeling changes visibly and on the scale. I chose to start with the lean program and will likely go doubles the second time around and classic the third. Definitely recommend!!!
1,Perfect for my needs,"I didn't want a huge countertop knife block, or a 20-slot monster for the drawer, this one is perfect. Basic, well-made, gets the job done. Other comments about the true size are correct, make sure you know which dimensions are correct before you buy it."
0,AT&T piece of JUNK!,"I would also like to take this opportunity to express my extreme disappointment in the phones I ordered. Unfortunately, the 2 phones I purchased are useless. I have used AT&T phones in the past with great satisfaction, so I knew to trust a 900 MHz with digital spread spectrum. This was not the case. The phone has had a buzzing sound since I first started using it over a week ago. I also gave this as a gift and the person using it complains of a hollow sound and buzzing noise.I suffered the consequence for buying a cheaper phone. It is cheap quality and not even usable. I am returning the product for a refund."
0,Very frustrating toy for my 3 yr. old,"My 3 yr. old son is a HUGE Blue's Clues fan so when I saw this, I picked it up for him. I'm sorry I did. I though it would be like his Handy Dandy notebooks in a Etcha-Sketch-sort-of-way. Boy, was I wrong. First, the child has to open the box with a key that doesn't quite fit, making it impossible to open. (Mommy broke a nail opening it)Once inside the box, the tracing papers just fell out, so it didn't work.Not a great product. I wish I didn't buy it because I had to make it ""disappear"" since it was so frustrating to my child."
0,AMAZINGLY INEPT MOVIE,"Based on these reviews I thought to try a genre I'd not explored.Ohmy, never again. Suggestion: Critically read reviews; going backafter viewing TAPEHEADS I saw clues to the inept, shallow, silly,awkward, amateurish nature of this faulty flick."
0,Pure album fillers!!!!,"No potential singles other than ""Throwback"", ""Burn"", and ""Yeah"". What the hell is he confessing on this album...... NOTHING. All he keeps singing about is his relationship w/ Chilli, what a publicity stunt.This album sounds like it was composed at the last minute and released the next day. Pick up Ms. Jackson's new album ""Damita Jo"", this album deserves the number 1 spot."
1,Funny! Great cast.,My husband lives these shows. You must understand their humor to enjoy it! We look forward to watching for years to come.
1,theres a new sherriff in town!!,"thses guys rock, and the vocals are 2nd to..well maybe dio ,well worth the price of addmission!"
0,incorrect item shipping by 3rd party seller,"I ordered the ""2 CD Bonus Deluxe"" set as pictured on the amazon website.The software I received from a third party seller appears to be the single CD version shown elsewhere (at a different price) on the amazon website. The software I received also states it is for Windows XP/2000 or older (which is NOT specified on this amazon page but is on other versions of the software on the amazon site) so I worry it may not be compatible with Windows 7 (which is on both laptops in our home.) I will be returning the software unopened.I am very disappointed and my daughter is very upset.I likely won't purchase software on amazon again, especially from third party sellers. Even if I do receive a full refund, it will take weeks, and in the meantime my child is upset she won't have the learning software she wanted."
0,On The Rez,"Enough with the drunk Indians, If they cannot learn to deal with the world as it is now, use productive work, discipline and self respect (like their forbears) there is nothing we can learn from these fools.Other peoples have been persecuted, displaced, conquered and have resureccted themselves, Instead the Indians lament the past and stay drunk."
1,Super System II,Super System II provides some great insights into playing poker.The book provides a great overview of a number of variations of poker.
0,Are You Serious?!?!?!,If you think i am buying these box sets think again. They are a COMPLETE waste of money. I am gonna wait for the complete collection of Naruto to come out on dvd. It's bad enough that they made 10 of these. This is just insane.Overall Grade: F-
1,"We love it, however, . . .","We truly love the Canon PIXMA mini260 Photo Printer. The quality of the photos is sharper, clearer and has brighter color than those we saw that were printed on the HP 712 photo printer.However, it would be very nice if the Canon PIXMA had 2 to 4 Gig of internal memory. Also it does not directly receive our Olypus XD photo flash card. This means buying an adapter to insert the card into in order to feed photos directly into the printer or downloading the files from the card onto the computer hard drive and then into the printer. It is not a problem as long as you have any flash card other than the XD.The adapters are a little hard to find locally. They'er avaliable on the net.All in all - the quality of the photos makes up for the file download hassle."
1,If you know how to die you will know to live.,The best learners are the ones who teach others what they learnd.Some times we learn things on the hard way.The smart people learns from others mistaqes.Even when we're dying we still able to learn and teach.The perfict day when a persons feels that he or she taught some one how to love and how to live.
1,Out of Africa,"Harbor by Lorraine Adams is an impressive first novel, full of wit and suspense and technical skill. Adams engages the reader from the first lines, rendering a mysterious, harrowing escape with cinematic vividness and taut storytelling. Over the course of the novel, the perspectives of multiple characters intertwine, extended flashbacks illuminate the present, and a finely-detailed image emerges of a world unbalanced, in which random violence thousands of miles away and years in the past still reverberate in the web of connected lives.Without spoiling anything for prospective readers, there are revelations in the story that are decidedly anti-climactic, and the ending is brusque. If Harbor is ever adapted to the big screen, these are issues that will have to be repaired."
1,A good primer.,"As a prospective first-time property purchaser, I found this book to contain some good information on the particulars of condos and townhouses. I did not read the section on Co-ops however. Parts of the book seemed to contain redundant information, not necessarily for emphasis. Perhaps the chapters were intended to be somewhat self-contained. ""Buying a home for Dummies"" has been my first resource. I'd recommend reading something like it first in order to fully appreciate the differences w/condos and townhouses described in this book."
1,Warning: May cause purring cat!,"Well, I was skeptical of this thing. Mostly, I wasn't sure if my cat would actually like it. She loves it. She just stretches out and purrs while I get to work. This thing really does get a lot of fur out. I'm pleased and I guess my cat is, too."
0,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.,the glowing reviews for this and the rest of the godin series are false . this has 1 or 2 half-decent cuts and the rest of the tracks were rare 'cause they're lousy. I suspect that the listing provides no sample clips because they would interfere with sales . DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.
0,A Golden Opportunity Lost!,"Given the number of Discoveries and Range Rover Classics in service and the arguably very high percentage of owners who perform their own maintenance, there must exist a very large market for a book which is a collation and presention of maintenance tips and repair methods and which goes beyond the elementary basics, and offers more detail and anecdotal advice than the various workshop manuals. This book, unfortunately, is not it. It wimps out before offering anything other than the barest first steps in many of the repair projects it describes. For example, under the section describing changing the automatic transmission filter, the advice given may be summed up as ""Don't"". Most every seasoned maintainer has done this task at least once, and those others, who would purchase such a book, would, no doubt, very much like to know what the job entails.The title 'Step by Step' would be better stated as 'Elementary First Steps'. Overall, a bitter disappointment!"
0,"Lots of words, limited content.","I bought this book based on a review in Scientific American. Though Mr. Tattersall's credentials are impressive, the book was not. I had expected something that would explain new insights we have gained into human evolution based on recent archeological findings. The book seems rather to be a long, wordy speculation on humanness, citing relatively few actual facts to back up assertions and lacking information on recent discoveries. Another thoughtful colleague of mine had about the same reaction. It also included a long (again) discussion of the irrelevant topic of trying to teach primates sign language. For me, it was not worth $18.00."
1,The cleanest rock/fusion riffs on the planet. No doubt.,"The guitarist for Dregs is, very likely, the most versatile guitarist on two legs. There are other examples of individuals who have attained this elevated level of technique and talent in their field. Michael Jordan, Einstein, Bach... Steve Morse just happens to play the guitar. Listen to this recording and, if you enjoy or play the guitar, you'll understand."
1,Animal house Horn,"Works great, Fun and good sounds. PA is not the best feature, But overall a deal for the price."
1,Good for your collection,Just having this one in your collection is great. Videos have certainly changed from the early days of Luther.
1,a surprise ending with a unbelievable twist,"This is the first book of Anne Perry's that ive read and i am sure it wont be the last. This book is fantastic. This book grabs your attention and wont let u put it down untill the very last page. The ending is such a twist and shocker that u would never guess the killer. I recommend The Twisted Root to anyone who is looking to read a ""not-put-downable"" mystery that will grab u until the last page. A must read and great book. Anne Perry is great!"
0,Used-Like New it is not true,Beware do not order any thing for this company . it is closed and person has got this item at a pawn shop and send it out .Did not check the disk to see about and not wrap around it and not sealed .
0,Somebody doesn't like cats...,"I rented this movie hoping for a fantasy look at the war between cats and dogs, but no, I didn't get that.What I did get was a movie making cats look pathetic, unintelligent, and evil, whilst the dogs wound up looking brave, noble, and smart. This contains essentially nothing but a bunch of dogs out smarting and beating up felines.Whoever thought of this must have had something against cats.It did make me chuckle once or twice, which is the only reason it gets 2 stars instead of 1.I don't recommend this to anyone."
0,nay,"The title of this book talks the talk but the pages don't walk the walk. It wasn't the entertaining read that i expected. the book is not comprehensive enough to be of any use and at times, it appeared, not mature enough for the audience I believe the author is catering to."
0,Not what I expected...,"I never thought I'd buy the original CD - but I did, and found it quite enjoyable.This Karaoke CD is not quite up to speed, however. First of all, ""Crazy"", which makes a good karaoke number, is not included here. Second, and more importantly, the backup band and singer are disappointing. For someone trying to actually learn Britney's sound, the singer makes a lot of changes(none of them good choices), changes that are distracting and confusing. The band behind her sometimes resorts to muzak-like recreations of the song.My advice is avoid buying this CD. If you like the original, sing along to that.Now I just have to wait for the next album..."
0,Sedona Cliffs Notes,"An interesting book that pleasantly reminded me of my visits to Sedona and the people I met there. But aside from its nostalgic value, I found this book a bit choppy. A series of vignettes more than anything else, most without any significant story line development given the 3-5 pages allocated to each. One of these, a brief vignette of a secondary character being robbed on a cruise, has no relevance to the central plot, particularly given that the character is never addressed again in the book. There is a central story line, but it isn't very strong, and doesn't unfold very naturally. The book concludes in an open-ended way that may be thought-provoking, but it felt to me more like the author simply ran out of gas. While I finished this book, and did like it for its triggering memories of the area, I found it disappointing against the backdrop of the other highly favorable reviews posted here."
1,Works!,"Since watching the dvd, I have used the techniques and have seen a vast improvement with my boys. I would recommend this to parents."
1,A fine continuation of the Compact-Space Series,"If you like cats, Sci-Fi, intrique, by-plays and an all-around well-told story, you'll love this story of Pyanfar Chanur's niece. Deserves it's own place apart from the other Chanur stories."
0,dreck,"Overly preachy.The story was alright, but the Christian message was not subtle, and ended up being a complete turnoff.American Protestant Evangelical Christians of a certain variety will enjoy this, though. I didn't, and can't recommend it at all."
0,loud,"We are using this in the entry hall of our house near the intake for the furnace. It is very convenient to fill (2 containers, 1 on either side), and you do not have the problem of mold building on the inside of the unit like the older canister humidifiers. However, I would not recommend this product if you have a problem with loud appliances. It turns on and off frequently and the lowest fan setting is still quite loud."
0,Too much talk,"Entirely too much flapping of the gums and not enough substance. Postcard from the Caribbean is much better, and that's says a lot about how utterly boring Hedonism is. Rent it, get it from a friend but skip on the purchase."
0,What a mess!,"I just had to share my story and find it hilarious that everyone else's is the same. I was all set to make my first ""perfect"" eggs today but after I cooked the first side, I was suspicious about the shallow top half and huge gap between the two sides of the pan, so I moved my egg over to the sink in order to flip the pan over. After performing a fast flip hoping to cheat gravity, I noticed the egg had slid past the edge of the pan and some of the egg was in my sink. I tried to tilt the pan and the egg raced onto my floor. I was left with egg yoke all over my counter, floor and sock.Should I attempt a pancake?"
1,Best I've found,"After many years of luke-warm curling irons, I finally stepped up to the plate and bought a ""professional"" curling iron. Definitely worth the money...and this brand works very well. The caveat is that is wears out in about a year. And at the same place...the cord end where it joins the curling iron. I finally wised up and checked Amazon...about half the cost of the beauty supply store...so it doesn't pain me so much that I'll have to replace it in a year."
1,This book taught me Credit Bureau Kung Fu!,"I know it sounds crazy, but after reading this book I felt like I knew Kung Fu when I was dealing with the Credit Bureaus and my past creditors. I had wonderful success prior to this book with the strategies that I learned from ""Guerrilla Guide to Credit Repair"", but when I started using the strategies from this book, I took it up a notch. In a few instances my creditors read the letters that I developed from reading this book, and simply gave in to my requests. The straetgies require a little time (A few months)a little typing and a little postage, but it yields amazing success. In fact, I have even begun helping others to recover their credit. God Bless Todd Bierman and Nathaniel Wice."
1,Not Out Of Print,"The geology of the Denali area is a fascinating mix where uplift from plate techtonics meet sharp glacially cut peaks. Mike Collier's book is the only one available for this area; and no, it is not out of print!"
0,"As comprehensive case books go, this one falls short","I found this book after seeing the film, Gerry (loosely based on the Kodikian case).The first surprise upon reading this was how fluffy Kersten is. The chapters read more like treatments, or barely annotated outlines, than conceptual entities offering ample information.This is, after all, the definitive work on the case thus far.There are at least three occasions where an editor missed an entire word (of note, a ""the"" is missing as the first one I spotted).As one reviewer mentioned, there is no Kodikian interview, or even a mention of an attempt.I purchased the book to learn more about the case than I had online, perusing articles. Such a desire was left unmet.How this was sent out into the market is beyond me."
0,disappointing,"While this book has good parts, they are completely countered by Pinker's theory that the humans are the exact OPPOSITE of a blank slate. I would highly recommend, for an alternate and more credible viewpoint, the works Of George H. Weinberg (sometimes listed without the ""H""), particularly his books THE PLIANT ANIMAL and SELF-CREATION."
1,Pixter,"My 7 yr old daughter loves this. I had to take her to work with me for an 8 hr shift, she played with this for hours. I bought 2 extra games, Animal Fun and Learning fun. I thought she was too old for the abc- 123 game, she loved it. There are so many different ways to use this game. It doesn't get boring for them.We are taking a trip in 2 weeks, we will definetly bring this along for the plane ride. Everyone at my job was coming over and playing with it too. I think they were going out to buy their children one before it becomes the ""hot Item"" this season."
0,This book was horrid.,"I was given this book by a friend. I can only assume they thought it would amuse me. I have never read such poor writing ever. Run-on sentences, misused words, incorrect punctuation...to name a few. Did anyone with a high school diploma edit this book? The premise is also somewhat amusing considering Californians are clamoring for a Terminator as Republican run at the Governorship. I can only hope this review helps one person not read this abomination. I would suggest reading the Enquirer before this book."
0,Worst movies ever,"These are by far the longest, most boring, and overall possibly the worst movies ever.The Godfather part I comprises maybe 3 or 4 of the most boring movies ever. It's about 10 or 15 hours of stupid, inane BS that nobody could possibly care about. I tried to watch it all the way through, but fell asleep after about 6 hours.The Godfather part II is even longer, somewhere between 15 and 20 hours, which according to Godfather fans makes it better than the first.The Godfather part III is so boring and awful that even fans of the first two movies can't stand it.And keep in mind, I was able to sit through all 4 or 5 hours of Citizen Kane and I actually kind of liked it, so my taste in movies is not the problem here."
1,Awesome product,I've done a lot of research on which protein powders are more effective and Syntha-6 is rated #2 on proteinpowder.net. I would buy the #1 but to me its way over priced. Plus the ratings are really close between the top 2. Syntha-6 is the best protein powder for its quality and price.I've been using this product for about 4 months now after using protein powders that friends have recommended me. I have to say that I have seen the most gain in mass and stregth in a shorter period of time than with other powders.
1,Milkweed,"My teacher assigned us 2 books relating to the Holocaust to read, and I couldn't be happier that I got Milkweed.Milkweed is a wonderfully dramatic novel that's unique writing style makes it an astounding addition to realm of Holocaust literature. Through the eyes of a young naive boy we see a child's perspective of reality in this horrific time. Jerry Spinelli creates a sense of realism within the book with a bold cast of characters that really get you hooked. The beginning is strong; superbly enthralling, as is the entire book. I HIGHLY reccomend this book to anyone interested in a different view of the Holocaust. ;)"

1,A useful high-level view of XML and applications,"I thought this was a very lucid and easy to read account of what XML is, what it's being used for, and why you might want to use it. It clearly explains the relationships and differences between XML, SGML, XSL, and HTML. It also has a nice (but thankfully brief) treatment on some of the Microsoft browser plugins for rendering XML in a browser.Besides cutting through the mystery of XML, this book actually contains some useful software: 5 free-ware XML parsers and an eval copy of an XML document editor."

0,DP26746 *Warning-don't do it*,Lasted about 18 months before the screen went out. Looks like its the power supply and this TV is headed to the trash.

It's a shame that a company will stake there reputation on a product like this and not stand behind it. They will lose my business for the next 30 years and wonder why they went the way of the Yugo. Pay an extra 100.00 on another brand and save the money taking it to the dump.
0,Patricia Cornwell gave up writing this book in its middle...,"Unfortunately, I had not read the Customer's review before purchasing the book. I think maybe Patricia got fed up with the story and gave up writing the book, passing the task to someone else who had not read the previous chapters... The plot gets lost in the middle, the end has nothing to do with the original plot, and where the heck has that psychic cat come from ? Sorry, Patricia. No more books from you in my library."
1,After playing DiRT I wish I hadn't wasted my time with Forza 2. It's that much better!,"I liked Forza 2 and thought it was fun, but the game began to get old quick. With that I went and bought Dirt and dangit I wish I had skipped Forza 2 all together. This game not only looks a lot better, but the courses are fantastic, don't feel repetitive, and racing on the dirt, in the mountains, in the desert is 10 times more fun than the same lame tracks of Forza.You just have to play it to see what I'm talking about but the stunning 1080p standard graphics just blow the 1080i of Forza 2 out of the water. GET IT YOU WON'T REGRET IT!"
0,Poor formatting on Kindle,"+ 5 stars for content- Formatting on Kindle is not goodWhen viewing last page of poem, the title of next poem is seen on bottom of Kindle page in large bold print.I find this distracting"
1,"Beautiful music, edited video.","All three tracks on this disc are beautiful works. I thoroughly enjoyed them all. The other reviews have covered this in detail.However, the video included on the CD is the censored and edited version. If you desire to see the full, unedited version you'll have to buy the VHS. I'm unsure why they bothered to put an explicit content sticker on the album when they censor out any explicit content.Besides the very dissapointing inclusion of the edited video, this EP deserves the highest praise."
0,I found it so poor!,"I got really excited when i bought this book, but when i received it i got really disappointed of my purchase, i thought it would be a full colored book, with a lot of pictures to help you and give you some project ideas, but it has just a few of them and has about 10 pictures of candles that are not so amazing, i think you should get another book if you want some ideas for gel candlemaking"

0,Table,"What a piece of junk! Aluminum what? Frame, that's about it. The table top is wafer fiber and the littlest amount of weight makes it bow. Had for about 4 weeks and now is at the dump. Don't waste your money. I'd rate this less than 1 star if the prompter allowed."
0,"If there were a 1/2 star rating, this book would get it","I don't understand how anyone at a notable publishing firm could read this and think it is a good novel. It reads like a high-school afterschool special but the ending is actually more contrived. Impossible, you say? No! It's not.You can read the other negative, more truthful reviews to understand how conflicted this novel is. I won't waste your time with that. Just be certain you are, in fact, a real masochist before picking this up."
1,Love this phone!,I have only had my KRZR for a month now but I love this phone. I am able to get a signal in once dead areas and the battery life is amazing. The only small detail that is a little annoying is that its hard to keep the face plate clean.
0,"Promising video, but bad copy","I was really interested to see this film based on the really positive reviews from earlier viewers. However, I was as disappointed when the DVD's Amazon sent (the first order and the second an exchange with an identical problem) failed to load on either my DVD player or my PC. Frankly, I think Amazon got ripped off by a unscrupulous distributor. I'll give them time to straighten out the problem, and try to order gain in a few months."
0,For Those Knowing Little Geology - a nice piece of fiction,"While the authors are well known, their background is not in the sciences or in engineering - a prerequisite to speak intelligently about oil and gas exploration. The attempt to set up ""abiotic oil"" as a valid source for petroleum is not only poorly done and referenced, but the examples they cite are already proven to have biogenic origin! As someone actually doing this for a living, this book is a very humorous read, chock full of unsubstantiated claims and incredibly wrong assumptions. Even the Russians now look for oil the same way we do - somehow they forgot to mention that small fact.Great bathroom fodder..."
1,C-H-I-C-K-E-N spells chicken!,"If you are looking for an intelligent,hilarious film, this is the one. Steve Bucemi is his regular quirky self and Thora Birch is as good if not better than her role in American Beauty. It is worth seeing for the mini-mart scenes with acid washed jean man. Stay til after the credits...you won't be disappointed. the movie is set to an amazing soundtrack (think Oh brother where out thou) and there are glimspes of some very fun artistic pieces. Can't wait to own on DVD!"
0,Bought 2 - Ripped on first use,"This is an absolute waste of money, the first one ripped on the first run. Then I had an exchange, and the second one ripped after a few weeks. The plastic screen is brittle and glued in. I do not Reccommend this product. Sort your act out Belkin."
0,mine must be defective,"I bought this because of rave reviews and a good concept. I wish I could send it back to Bodum and ask them what were they thinking. I am so disappointed. Poor thermal quality, makes a leaky mess unless poored slowly and at just the right angle.. It needs a gasket to prevent leaks and seal in the heat. I just get a better cup out the old time glass carafe."
1,Thought Provoking,"When I'm looking for a new book to read, I alwaysread the Amazon reviews. Even the not-so-great reviewsfor this book were well thought out and balanced. Ihad to take a look. I may not agree with everythingin the book, but I found it be thought provoking andwell worth my time. Whenever we, as human beings,attempt to bring together science and spirituality, itis, in my humble opinion, a step foward in the evolutionof our species. Sherri Cortland,ND; [...]"
1,Good portrait of a dysfunctional family,"Troy Alleyn is commissioned to paint a portrait of the great actor Sir Henry Ancred. Though thanks to journalist/friend Nigel Bathgate she has some idea of what's in store for her, nothing fully prepares her for the amount of in-fighting, jealousy and histrionics the Ancred family can provide. Against this backdrop, Troy is reunited with her husband, Inspector Alleyn, who has been away on CID business for a couple of years. This book is one of the more interesting novels, in that: A) You get to see the beginning of the mystery from Troy's point of view. B)Marsh really knows how to write about awkward reunions and C) You get to see something of the artist's process (not surprising, I suppose, since Marsh herself painted). Another good read by Marsh."
1,Excellent Price,"We saw this movie over a year ago. My husband said he would like it for his DVD collection and I waited until it came down to a phenomenal low price ($5.) It was a ""bonus"" Christmas gift that he didn't expect."
0,Not a kid movie,"It is entertaining for a b movie, however towards the end a guardian evil bull was in the movie with a two foot full shaped penis, if that wasn't bad enough then the guy cut it off and wore it as a necklace for the rest of the movie. IF you can swallow that you may be mildly entertained."
1,Good Tale with a Surprising End - Classic Follett,"Fun historic adventure tale with great character development that make Follett's stories my favorite. Was a bit disappointed with the end, however - felt like he was trying to quickly wrap things up in a James Bondish kind of way. But then I read the postscript - highlight of the book IMO. Not his best book for me, but like all Follett books I've read - a great tale based on historic events. Highly recommended."
1,Christopher Penczak is reliably amazing,"Every book I have read by Chriatopher Penczak is consistently well researched, easy to follow, entertaining and detailed. I would recommend anything and everything he has published. I love his approach to metaphysical material - you can tell he speaks from experience an not hearsay when he delves into topics. He offers different points of view and allows you to decide in what resonates with you best.Specifically in this book, I appreciated how often he reiterated the core of Reiki - that you can't do any harm with it. Often times in our culture there is an association of fear in regards to energy work, and he really conveyed a sense of safety when exploring this.This is one of my favorites, for sure. It explores Reiki so well, and helps people to see that sometimes a certain energy can have many names, but the results are the same. Very empowering."
0,I was waiting and waiting...,"I was waiting and waiting...for so long, to be insulted and to be treated with much disrespect...and I kept praying that this would occur and just as the Secret had predicted, it happened...what a transforming experience it was...it made me realize that I had a secret desire to be treated that way...and so what did everything else mean? did it all go out the window? well, all I know is that the street doesn't seem to go both ways...so don't worry, your worst prayers will be answered, your best nightmares will come true!"
1,gut-striking,"Tim O'Brien's storytelling style is intoxicating. He examines what it means to tell a story, and what the telling of stories does for all of us. Reading this book is like getting the wind knocked out of you, you almost can't believe that it affects you the way that it does. A truly great read."
0,3 piece Halloween tombstone,"The idea of a 3 piece Halloween tombstone at this height seemed like a good one as it would be easy to store. However, it didn't turn out as well as expected. The three pieces do not mate up well. At least with the one I got, it mated so poorly that you could see the posts meant to hold the pieces together. The posts don't really hold the pieces securely either. I think the top piece would have come off in a wind. I suppose you could try to trim the styrofoam so the pieces would fit better but I used minimal expanding foam insulation. It filled the void space between the pieces, hid the posts and glued the three pieces together making the whole thing more stable. Then trimmed and painted to match the rest of the tombstone. It's good now but for the price I paid it shouldn't need all the extra work to make it usable. I'll be sticking with one piece tombstones from now on."
1,I loved this watch!,"I just came over here to look for a new book, and I happened to see the advertisement for this watch. I have it, and I LOVE this watch! I'm a big Mission Impossible Fan (looking forward to seeing MI3) and so I didn't know Tom Cruise would be wearing it in the movie. How cool!Anyway.. this is a great watch. It's rough and tough, and easy to use, and does EVERYTHING I wanted a watch to do. I had a hard time convincing my husband that I really DIDN'T want yet another dainty little gold ""girly"" watch. I'm an artist, and I wanted a tough watch that would perform well and didn't need to be pampered. This is the one! I highly recommend it!"
0,car fabric repair,I am not pleased with the product - even with the color chart and following directions was unable to get the color to match - even a little. I mixed them several times. I don't have that hard of a color - just gray -
0,DO NOT BUY--Does not have a robust interface,U3 works on some machines and not others. The support from Sandisk is canned and didn't help. The expectation seems to be that the user will either reconfigure the computer they are using (kinda defeats the purpose of having software on your flashdrive so that you don't mess with different computers) or you will uninstall U3 (then why pay extra for it?).This was a waste of money.
1,"beautiful crib, but....","I just unpacked the crib to be sure that all the parts were accounted for. For the people who already have this crib, I wanted to ask, where can I find the appropriate conversion rails to convert the crib into a twin bed? I know it is early, but I wanted to buy the extra parts NOW in case this crib is discontinued down the line, etc."
0,Beware,"I may have gotten a bad copy, but the sound quality on this release is horrible - about the same as a scratchy record."
1,One of the best books on TCP/IP I've ever read,I highly recommend this book to whoever wants to have solid understanding of TCP/IP.It covers even advanced topics with a clear and simple approach.In my opinion this is a must have book on TCP/IP.Absolutely well spent money!
1,Not bad for an old school album,Lil Zane jumped in and off the charts faster than a speeding bullet. This album isn't bad if you like young rappers.
0,A Big Waste from the Woodman.,"....eh. i usually enjoy Woody (Manhattan, Hannah and her Sisters, Manhattan Murder Mystery, Mighty Aphrodite), but Allen's writing needs an enema. It's weird, i actually enjoyed the PLOT of this film MORE than the dialogue (which is usually the opposite of past Woody Allen films for me). Problems abound in the film though, most notably Tea Leoni and Woody Allen have ZILCH chemistry (which is paramount to the story), and the ending seems put on fast forward. I did enjoy the light comedic moments alot though (and was surprised at how often i laughed at jokes about blindness), and george hamilton and debra messing are cute in supporting roles...."
1,Definitely for collectors/adults,"Rock has written a great review of this ""toy."" I have collected many of these HP figures; one of the wands actually broked when I tried to remove it from the package, and let me tell you, these tiny little things are a PAIN (not to mention next to impossible) to glue. TINY TINY TINY...so these are definitely not for little children, especially with the small part factor. Again, cannot rave enough about the sculpt and how much this one looks like the movie version of Voldemort."
0,Unhappy,This product did not work at all....and I gave it as a gift. so I am not very happy with it and don't really know what to do.
1,Testimony,"Mason Proffit joins Buffalo Springfeild in testifying to the new document that taught us all we need to do more. More for the environment, more to dismantle the John Birch/NRA body politic, ..... more for the revolution. Mason Profitt reminded us we are not doing enough to challenge our corrupt government, unfair trials, neglect of Native American treaties, racism...then there was Jackson State and Kent State. Then Nixon (not to mention 'nam), Watergate. What have we learned?"
0,Aweful,"This Item is terrible. All the utensils are cheap and very poorly made. Very flimsy and easily broken. The holder itself is good, but everything else feels very cheap!!!"
1,Presto 04820 PopLite Popper review,"I like the popper. It is convenient, and very easy to use. Popcorn was completed in 3 to 4 minutes. And, easy to clean up. Only minor complaint was that the ""butter melter"" did not melt the butter by the time the popcorn finished popping. Over-all, I do recommend the product."
1,Great for students interested in International Studies!,Robinson gives a detailed account of the United States position concerning foriegn affairs where Latin America and other developing nations are concerned. He is thorough and the book proves to be a great reference guide as well as provocative reading.
1,amazing find!,"This dvd is a treasure to discover! Approach it with an open mind and eagerness to explore the fascinating history of the spook show. The ""Monsters Crash the Pajama Party"" movie is but one appetizer on a dvd smörgsbord of fun and spooky film tid-bits. The movie ""Tormented"" also on the disc is longer than ""Monsters"" and more serious. The 3D part viewed with the included 3D glasses works only if your imagination is stronger than your attention span. Buy this dvd and play it every halloween time. Start a new tradition with the kids. Everyone must take part in this dvd adventure!"
0,It's ok but......,"For waiting 25 years it could have been a bit better. It was good to see the old characters and missed the ones no longer with us. It's inexpensive enough to purchase, but think you may only watch it the once and pass it on. Great ideal, very lackluster execution."
0,No Response,"I have a problem with this clock in that the second hand freezes at the 1 or 2 second mark and loses synch with the minute hand. I've sent emails beginning on 12/27/2010.

1,I love this cd!,Chris has been my favorite Idol contestant so far. I was really looking forward to see what kind of music he would produce once he was allowed to break away from the Idol theme choices. I wasn't disappointed! He sounds fantastic.
1,Weeping Woman is a haunting book,"This book reads like an extended prose poem - very lyrical and beautiful, at times surreal, and not plot-driven. The weeping woman is the ethereal embodiment of the sorrows of Prague, haunted by its past. I can recommend it for those who like poetry and atmospheric, mysterious subject-matter. The language can be convoluted at times, but give it a try."
1,Excellent view from a different perspective,"I found Bishop Foster's book while searching Las Vegas wedding sites. Her unique frame of reference of her many weddings performed in Las Vegas was as touching as it was humorous. My fiance and I planned our wedding using some of the information from the wedding ceremonies in the back of the book. It was a most beautiful day! I highly recommend Bishop Foster's unique ""Chicken soup"" type of book to those who think that Las Vegas is only ""smoke and mirrors."""
1,Worth the price,The only problem I have with these is that when they arrived at my house I noticed two little scratches on the frames. You can't notice them when you're wearing them but whatever. Good buy for the price.
0,Flimsy,This product is pretty flimsy. Our dog knocks it down on an regular basis. The feet also don't seem to want to stay on the legs.
0,3 in 1 toy,"I bought this 2 years ago thinking my son (2years)will get to play with three toys in 1. Well,its been sitting in the garage for 2 years. It's hard to pedal."
0,Not the best collection for piano music,"If you would like to try some piano music. Do not get this one.This CD is not emotional, not rhythmic, not insipiring, and, the most important, not relaxing indeed. I don't know what feelings this CD gives you!So try other piano albums, never try this."
1,A Nobel Laureate of Films,"I saw this movie for the first time when it was in theaters. Younger movie fans will find it can't compare with modern film-making in special effects (no movie this old can) and will have no reason to suspect the level of impact it had on teenagers and college students at that time. Despite being pre-Star Wars, the models of the space ships and scenes inside the ship were impressive. The technology and mission felt big and important - impressive - and the autonomous robots Huey, Dewey, and Louie were wonders. Add to that a lead character (Lowell) and his cause played brilliantly against the backdrop of rebellious attitudes of the day. (Just look up Joan Baez, who sang folksy save the children and the earth songs through the movie, in your history books.) Despite being a psychotic megalomaniacal murderer, I have friends who still remember Lowell as a heroic friend of the true earth and the human spirit. I must therefore, give this movie a full five."
1,The BEST researched historical novel that I've read,"Mr Lund has done an almost superhuman job of doing the research necessary to make this novel believable. I was most impressed with the details of the town of Palmyra and vicinity as well as the historical context of the Erie Canal. I hadn't realized that the Erie Canal went through the area (I live in Washington State and have never been to the Palmyra area). Lund's descriptions were so clear that I could easily picture the setting of each Chapter. The book also has historically accurate tidbits of information about LDS Church history, which added interest to the story.Reading this book has given me an interest in taking a vacation to visit historic LDS Church landmarks in the eastern USA.--George Stancliffe"
0,I want my money back!,I regret the day I bought this book. I wish I knew where the author lives to get a refund. I am very dissappointed with Mr. Patterson ever writing this book. The plot is very elementary for his usual readers and the story is surreal. The main characters are children who were genetically engineered to be great human species and have special powers. It's a dumb book to waste time and effort to read. You can do better than this James Patterson!
0,only lasted 6 months,"I was happy with this at first but after about 2 months of use (making a single cappuchino every morning for myself), it began to loose its speed even with fresh batteries. At about 6 months, it just stopped working at all."
0,"Humorous, factual, and entertaining.","As a former Carbon County resident who is familiar with all the people mentioned in this book, I know the author did a super job of telling their story. The author paints vivids pictures of each characture and relates their stories in an easy to read style. Great gift for anyone who loves the lore of Wyoming."
0,Poor quality,Like others here I bought the 5 piece set on the gold box deal. What junk. These are made in China knives that can be had for a dime a dozen at any discount retailer.
1,A Damned Masterpiece..ha ha ha..,"Machine Gun Etiquette hasn't left my turntable since I bought it a week ago and is well on it's way to becoming an all-time favorite. It's a shame this masterpiece of the Damned's is all too often lost in their debut album's (Damned Damned Damned) shadow.Their second full-length, Machine Gun Etiquette is the perfect marriage of garage rock, punk and pop. It is evident that after the departure of their founding guitarist- who's songwriting was heavily influenced by american garage rock- the remaining members were able to express their own diverse musical tastes and personalities with this album.This is the Damned at their absolute peak. Along the lines of the Buzzcocks, the Saints, and American counterparts the Dead Boys and the Dictators, the Damned were one of the best power-pop/punk bands of their era. Machine Gun Etiquette is proof!"
1,Fashionista,"I would have rated this machine 5 stars if it had come with popcorn but it doesn't so it gets 4 stars. This machine is so much fun to have in our home theatre room and it makes great popcorn. It's been a hugh success. We've added the popcorn novelties,buckets, bags,etc to go along with it. Everyone raves about the popcorn and says it taste just like the stuff you buy at the movies. Here's the secret.Pop 1/2 of cup of kernels in 3 table spoons of COCONUT oilOnce fully popped, add salt and and a butter flavored oil topping to taste."

0,A waste of money!!!!!!!,I purchased this book and seriously regret it. Compared to Demay's text this book is worthless except for its stats info. All of the people I know who have Bibbo use it either as a microscope stand or book end. Please don't buy this book.
1,Raising More Money: A Step-by-Step Guide to Building Lifelong Donors,"Emotions guide actions, by establishing a channel for emotions to flow, ""Raising More Money"" developed a procedural methodology to educate donors to ensure organizational sustainability. Instead of focusing on scarcity, the authors look to abundance. It's not shaking every tree and expecting fruit, it's planting and cultivating the right trees and realizing your garden grows when attention is provided.Remember to follow their plan...That's the key."
1,Still one of the best!,"Peter Drucker is simply one of the very best of all time. The Effective Executive, albeit over 40 years old, still applies as much as the day it was published. If you're serious about improving your performance as an executive, this book is a must read."
1,Excellent & comprehensive resource--Natural therapies ...,"Superb book on the problems leading to infertility and what can be done to resolve these. The section on Male Infertility was enlightening--and a must-read for all couples struggling to have a baby. So often we look at the woman when conception does not occur--and half the time it's a ""male"" problem. Get it checked out--because there is treatment, according to these authors. I was most impressed with the natural therapies sections in the book--and the part on reducing stress was most helpful for me and my wife."
0,Too much static,"I gave up on this high price transmitter in favor of the Griffin 40-30 RoadTrip, too much static, does not charge the itouch and tuning difficulties."
1,LOVE!,"It feels great to be responsible when it comes to being ""green"" but Seventh Generation really makes it easy when they have such great products! I have fairly soft water where I live so I only have to use about 1/2 of a cup to wash a load of dishes. It works just as well as other name brand products without all the chemicals. AND if you use the subscribe and save feature the cost goes way down! Can't say enough good things about this product!"
1,BRAVO,"This book is nothing less than brilliant! I see this wonderful, ethereal quality--harkening to the Romantic era. Wrights work reminds me of Byron, with a bit of the idealism of Keats. Bravo!"
1,Talk about power....,I have been a classically trained drummer for over 10 years and just recently got into the hand drumming. I have Never felt the kind of power and joy thatI felt after I started working in this side of it. This book is an incredible tool for Expert and Novice alike. It gives you the basics and you just grow from there!
1,Portable ears,Kensington put out a nice sound for a smaller portable unit. Very light unit and the batteries (rechargeable) hold up well. Nice on/off switch on front. Can use a remote with a nano. Built in stand works fine and is convenient.

0,The Price.....,"It's not so much that I dislike the thing itself more than that I simply don't feel like spending the current price of 80 U.S. Dollars on it... I would imagine that it had a limited retail, unlike it's DVD counterpart, which goes for 15 dollars."
0,It Broke,"I ordered this for my son who is in college (storage space is an issue). It might be that he just did not take proper care of it, but it broke after a week. It may be fine for someone who is careful with their things but I would not buy it again."
1,A great aid to meditation!,"Tarot of the Trance, by Eva Marie Nitsche, is one of the most beautiful decks in my collection. I liked the the Mexican grotesque feel of the artwork, with it's bright colors and dreamlike figures, though some readers may find it a bit ""busy"". The complete deck of 80 cards has an additional 2 cards: a title card and an inspiration card, describing the author's basis for developing this particular deck. While a far cry from Universal Waite imagery that we are all so familiar (and sometimes bored with) the deck has some similarities. The pips and Minor Arcana are completely illustrated. The Major Arcana cards are flawless! Check out the The Star and The Hermit, two of my personal favorites. I recommend this deck as a meditational guide rather than a ""reading"" deck."
1,"Smart Women Finish Rich, etc.","I have borrowed both this title and his Smart Couples Finish Rich from the library. Because I believe this book is so timely and comprehensive I want to own it. It is a wealth of information, and well written. He uses plain language. Excellent, excellent, excellent..."
1,Very Good...Could have been better!,"Having read the book and gotten the sound track a while back, thought it was time to watch the movie. It was a nice tour for this Yankee, but there were not enough outdoor scenes of beautiful Savannah, one of my complaints of the film. Also, Chablis, though amusing at first, was definitely overdone, and this character wears very thin after a while. The rest was all in all superb, the scenes in the Mercer House all well done, and the acting just as good. Nice wry humor with Cusik/writer character too. The mystery aspect also different, but maybe the voodoo could have been played down a bit. Could have been a masterpiece, but not quite."
1,the best Christmas story ever,"From the time my kids were small, we've read this book outloud almost every Christmas Eve - a great story of knowing that there is more to Christmas than lots of presents under the tree."
1,What an incredible film!,"What a masterpiece! Disney has done it again! There are so many wonderful moments in this film! The ""Creeper"" steals the show! Hats off to Phil Fondacaro!"
1,keeping the details to a bare minimum,"Raising Hell: A Concise History of the Black Arts and Those Who Dared Practice Them by Robert Masello is an concise but comprehensive overview of the history of occult arts throughout the centuries, filled with interesting stories and creative characters in search of power beyond their control. The book is divided into several distinct sections, each dealing with a specific aspect of the occult arts, giving the reader a wonderful glimpse into the powers which lie in the great beyond. Although it makes mention of numerous sources and reference material, by keeping the details to a bare minimum he only serves to wet one's whistle on the nature of his survey, making readers want to delve deeper into regions unknown. A great start for people interested in the occult but don't know where to start."

1,Great budget ear phones,"I bought these ear phones for working out for two simple reasons: They are cheap. They have the rubber, sound-isolation tips. While the sound quality of these ear phones is not as good as JBuds (I own the J2's), they are still much better than the standard ipod earbuds. They are also quite comfortable, and fit in my ears perfectly. For the price you really cannot go wrong. If you are not looking for exceptional quality (which I assume is true if you are considering $5 headphones), and you just want cheap, reliable, comfortable earphones that effectively muffle outside noise, these are for you."
0,Hard Rock Suckage,"I saw these guys per chance during this tour. They played Horde for some unknown reason. With all the hype that surrounds these schlemiels, i can't get over the played out rock poses of Mr. stapp and the atrocious penchant for writing tunes that are only enjoyed by those who drink PBR in a smokey hick bar. Rev up your truck, grow your mullet and move to the sunny coast. I will give them two stars based on the fact that all of thier songs sound the same, but don't necessarily make my ears bleed."
1,CAPITOL RECORDS VERSIONS ARE MUCH BETTER!!!!!!!!,"The Angel Records re-issues of the ""Rodgers and Hammerstein Three Pack"" are terribly presented. The sound quality is horrible and the ""expanded matereal"" is nothing but the dance numbers taken right from the unmixed six- track stereo tapes, complete with every foley effect (EX: foot stomping, animal noises,and unwanted dialougue only meant for he movie).All three soundtracks were issued on LP by Capitol records after each film debuted (1955- 1957). The LP versions feature the entire vocal score (minus the extra material) and no foley interruption, strictly instrumental and more pleasant to listen to. The LP versions were released on 3CDs in 1994 as a box set (bearing the same title as this one. This version of the box set is still in print and is highly recommended. You will enjoy these classic scores if you listen to the REAL SOUNDTRACKS."
1,Lateef still sounds fresh today!,"First time I heard Yusef Lateefwas when I stumble upon hisEastern Sound cd. Just blew meaway. He had other soloistson there, but Yusef grab yourattention and held from beginningto end. A gem are the followingYusef albums:1/ Eastern Sound2/ African American Epic Suite3/ Blue Yusef LateefAmazing master: simple, clear,hypnotic playing thru and thru!"
1,Not Quite Happy Ever After...,"""Paul and Michelle"",the sequel to ""Friends"" is set 3 years after the lovers last saw each other. Paul goes to find Michelle against the wishes of his Father. Of course they meet again and have a joyful reunion. But things do not go quite as well as planned... There is no happy ever after here, more a shade of reality which many will identify with. Watching this can be a little disappointing, after all to fans of the first film we all have an idea of how this follow up might have been. Well worth catching if you wonder what happened after ""Friends"". Still waiting for that third and final sequel!"
1,Great Product,"This was exactly what I wanted. It is cute, light weight, and you can hear GREAT! I'd recommend this to everyone!"
0,Curt trailer bearing protector,"this product did not work fot me.i installed them and fill them with grease and could not get the grease gun off of the grease nipple.i pulled so hard the bearing protector broke. i had a seal, spring and a clip laying in the street. i still have the other part with nipple stuck to my grease gun."
1,A Great Soundtrack to a Classic Film,"Being a lover of Stanley Kubricks' movies, I saw ""Lolita"" for the first time about a year ago and absolutely loved it!The soundtrack is a great compliment to the film. It took me quite sometime to get ""Lolita Ya-Ya"" out of my head after seeing the movie. The soundtrack also includes dialogue diectly from the movie which I thought was great. ""Shelly Winters Cha-Cha"" remains one of my favorite songs ever, and I always picture that scene whenever I hear the song play.The inlay of the CD is great and has extensive notes and pictures from the film and notes regarding the soundtrack. They really did a great job remastering the soundtrack. If you loved ""Lolita"" as much as I did, I would definitely pick up a copy of this soundtrack."
0,Okay,"Even though the album is okay, they are not original. They tried unsuccessfully to duplicate Bone Thugs N Harmony's unique and original sound!"
1,Sexually speaking...,This is an excellent collection of articles on the construction of sexuality across cultures. No similar book exists so it fills a gap in an interesting and well organized manner. It is comprehensive and insightful - you'll never look at sex the same way again!
0,Dude whens it over,This movie starts out funny but towards the movie the storyline gets pretty old. Its definitaly not a classic or a good movie. And its super boring and not funny. My favorite part was when it was over.
1,Excellent Product,The Smart Strip is an excellent product. I saved money the first month. Well worth the investment.
0,Useless,There are definitely better key rings out there if you just want to use it as a key ring. It is difficult to use this product as intended.. it being very small to handle. People with small hands might still find it handy but people with large or even medium hands would find it difficult to handle.The coating on top wears out after medium usage and the groves do not really fit in places it should actually do. Overall NOT a recommended buy.
1,Great Music But...,"Red Rodney's ""1957"" is a great album but it is the exact same material as is on the Savoy CD ""Fiery"" (see my review). I mail-ordered this title without realizing this. Don't repeat my mistake."
0,No Way!,"The only good songs on Load were Bleeding me and Until it Sleeps, but wow. There are NO good songs on this cd. Save your money for Master of Puppets and Ride the Lightning..."
1,SIMPLY THE BEST!!!!,"A friend lent me Anastacia's first CD years ago and I was amazed by her voice. On a recent trip to Europe, I found this album in one of the music stores and since then have become a true Anastacia fan. This is definitely her best album to date, and one of the greatest rock albums put out in a long time. There isn't one track that I skip on this cd! It is a wonder how an artist as talented as Anastacia is so overlooked in the U.S."
0,do not buy this book,kc's problems and solutions comes in PDF file format on a cd-rom that comes with the corresponding text. this is pretty useless is you have the text (4th edition).
1,Awesome Young Man..with a Future,"This awesome young man caught my attention on the Ally McBeal show and continues to live up to his talent in this CD. His wonderful performance with ""To Where You Are"" is chillingly beautiful.The other songs are just icing on the cake....some religious and some love ballads. A nice rendition of ""Vincent"" and all time favorite. You will enjoy his ""bocelli-like"" voice and mature sound."
0,What?,"Gerard's name is spelled incorrectly, his birthday is wrong and apparently he started art school eleven years before he was ever born.I also was not aware of the fact that Belleville and Chicago were located in Britain."
1,Garmin nuvi 370,"I have previously used a Tom-Tom 910 in Europe and in the US. The screen on the Garmin is easier to read in all light. Like the Tom-Tom 910 it has both US and European maps. It has a significantly longer battery life than other Garmin and Tom-Tom products. It seems easier to use than the Tom-Tom and is just as accurate. I like the voices on the Tom-Tom better than the voices on the Garmin. Overall, I am pleased with the Garmin Nuvi 370. The price was very competitive."
0,Poor Quality Control,"Doesn't look like Liberty Mountain has any quality control on this. 2 of the three aluminum panels were cut correctly, and one was way off. So far off, that you can't use the holes to clip them all together for easy storage. Come on, it's not that hard? Stack them up and see if they are all the same, for heaven's sake. This should have never left the store."
1,"A Different Experience, But Worthwhile","When I saw Rent Filmed Live On Broadway, I'd already seen Rent twice actually live on Broadway, and I'd seen the movie three times. Every one of them is great, and each one is a different experience.What I loved about this was that you got such a close up view of the action. I can't say it was like I was there, but it was completely worth it. It gives the musical a whole new insight. In this, I saw things I wouldn't have seen even if I had front row seats at Rent.I completely recommend it for any Rent fan. It's no substitute for the actual show, but with it being closed on Broadway, this is a great way for Rent to live on."
0,Wasn't the Inspirational Book I was Hoping For,"I read the author's book, What Great Teachers Do Differently, years ago and found myself both motivated and inspired. I picked this one up hoping for the same. I expected a book that would renew my passion for teaching. This book did not deliver.There were a lot of great ideas about making your classroom more inviting. As an extension, there were also great ideas about how to make a presentation space more inspiring. There was no other useful advice or inspiration.The author writes in the same positive tone as in his other books, but the book did not live up to its title."
1,Great book,"I will be fifty years old on February 17, 2004, if the Lord allows. This book is interesting, inspiring and worth the money; and it has great photographs. Not done reading it yet--I wanted to save some of the goodness for later. Please check it out--it makes a great coffee-table book as well."
0,Disappointing,"When I put this product on my ears, my ears get stuffed up like I'm on an airplane. Plus, I don't understand the noise canceling function. When I turn it on, I can still hear everything going on around me, except my music turns off. If noise cancelling means turning off my music I could have done that without spending all this money."
0,Beware: Long term test results,"... After only two years my Pro Heat Bissell's water pump just stopped pumping the water/cleaner solution. I would expect more from a model this expensive. We only have a few carpeted rooms in the house, most are hardwood, and we did not use the cleaner THAT much. I would look at other brands for better reliability. Also: When it DID work, it leaked on the floor when not in use! Steer clear of this lemon."
1,silicone spatula,a bit cumbersome to store due to shape of handle. Also feels somewhat unbalanced. Heavier than most spatulas. Pointed tip does a good job of cleaning out bowls or pans.
1,Love em! Love em! Love em!,Revamped my backyard and used these as an edging to one side of a designated public access area. Very nice! They were a perfect setoff with my solar ground lamps. Love em!
1,Dvorak Bagatelles,"Wonderful music. We heard some of these on the radio and had to search a little to find this, but it's worth it."
0,"A Horrible, Absolutely Anti-Christian Approach","This is a wolf in sheep's clothing. It passes itself as ""God's way"", but it is the way of devil. It has nothing to do with the way of Jesus, the God of Love, the loving shepherd of his flock, and everything to do with a vengeful, retributive, unjust deity. That it may work to affect behavior says nothing about its effect about the soul of children, and upon the family. Our children, our Christian children, deserve much, much better."
0,not working for me,"I don't know if this review is for the Junkets or for the seller. These tablets do not work for me. I have tried with different milks, I added calcium to the milk, I inoculated one hour before, I inoculated and renneted overnight. All around, impossible to obtain a clean break the way Fankhauser describes. I gave up on junkets, and I ordered Austrian Bio Ren and Fromasin, also from Europe. Maybe this is a bad batch, the box is stamped 12 08 - it is now sept 2011-and I do not know what that means. Gave 2 stars since includes a nice booklet with recipes, but these Junkets are junk."
0,A flawed polemic,"The Epilouge says enough in its title ""Its your last chance Stupid Jews'. This book is not worth the paper its written on, it is pure extremist angry polemics, without a thesis or a cohesive argument between its paltry number of pages. The main just of this book is to flush out the 'conspiracy' of Rabins assasination. The trouble is that their was no conspiracy and the reasons for the assasination and the details of it are pretty much clear. The book has become a major revisionist text even though it has little scholarly merit and contains little factual ideas, most of it is jurnalistic heresay.Seth J. Frantzman"
0,Nappy Hair!!!!,The seller was great received the package within a few days. Manikin looks like the pic there's several grey hairs through out the manikins head. The hair is too nappy to handle for me. It's so nappy you can't really style the manikin's hair :( that the only negative thing i will say about this product.
0,Quality problems,"Stroller arrived with front axle assembly so loose that ball bearings fell out. Instructions are minimal, pictures are too small to show the details they are intended to illustrate. The sun shade support broke the first time we raised the shade. I can only recommend that you not buy this stroller. We bought the other brand (cheaper) and it is great."
1,REBELDE,I love rebelde you should her it is a spanish cd I love a lot!!!! I love RBD I love them I love Diego The boys are all Hoties!!!!!!!!!!! They sing so good!!!!!11
1,"no, you cannot invite that frog!","great cinderella story, mixed between muppets and people, so many funny lines that you pick up on once you watch the movie a few times, so funny!"
1,Good Value for the Price,"The HP Deskjet 6620 is a great little printer (actually it is not that LITTLE, it is quite wide)for the price. Speedy! And the print quality is good. I have not tried color, though. I like the status icons on the front, but do wish there was a USB hookup on the front as well as the back. But, for the price, you can't beat it."
1,<My favorite CD,"I've listened to this CD many, many times. I can honestly say that, as a long time fan of The Sons of The Pioneers, it is one of their best, if not the best. This CD displays the harmony that made them so popular that it continues today. They set the guideline for all others to be judged. Some of my personal favorites are, At The Rainbows End, When The Golden Train Comes Down, and The Touch of God's Hand. This is the true Pioneer singing.This will become your favorite immediately and you will be singing it in your mind all day.If I didn't own it, I'd buy it again."
1,Worked,Rewarded my daughter with stickers and she loved it actually bought another. It actually made her want to use the potty and after she did she always wanted to pick out a stcker
1,She's Only Going UP! From Here!!!,"Well this is the second release off the super sexy Shania Twain's multiplatinum album UP! And this is a great single. The first track is the country (green) version of Up and it's a really cool country song. The remix of Getcha Good is a pretty long and really wants you to get up and dance. The Ka Ching remix is the best off the CD it makes you feel like your in a club in the Carribean it's awesome, you have to get this CD!!!!!"
1,Art Contest,"Ten of these were ordered for an school art contest. They are the ""Classic"" Etch-A-Sketch as stated in the item description. They also were a good price and arrived quickly."
1,Perfect Extra bowl,"Kitchen Aids are one of the best mixers you can buy - but initially when you purchase one you only get one bowl. This extra bowl fits the standard mixer, and is great because it even comes with a handle that is extremely helpful and convenient. If you are like me and searching for an extra bowl to go with your great mixer this is the purchase for you."
1,So Far So Good,"We've only used it a few times, but this mixer seems to perform well. The lowest speed is slow enough so you can work your way up to a faster speed without sending your ingedients flying all over the kitchen. The beaters are stronger than they look, and are much easier to scrap clean than flat beaters. As long as it holds up over the years, I think this mixer is a good buy."
0,DO NOT buy from them,This is NOT the item you will get when you order form them.You will instead receive New Chapter BLENDED Tamanu and Olive OIl. What a scam!!!
1,Love it,I bought this product to help my nails after wearing artificial nails for years. I put a coat on every day for a week and took it off. I did that for about three weeks and my nails are stronger than before. I enjoy showing them now more than I did about a month ago.
1,THIS CD WAS WORTH THE WAIT,"It's been 2 years since the release of the double platinum selling Evolution cd and once again Martina proves she's worth waiting for. While very different from Evolution, Emotion is still spectacular in it's own right. From the beautiful love ballad ""There You Are"" which gives me goose bumps to the feisty attitude filled ""It's My Time"" Martina proves that she doesn't know how to do anything half way. She puts more into a song than anyone I've ever heard and it goes without saying, she has the best voice in country music today. I highly recommend this one. You won't be disappointed."
0,What a ripoff,"What was advertized was a 10 page digital document of over 2700 words. What was delivered was a 360 word blurb, nothing more than a product announcement.NIKON DEBUTS NEXIV VMR-H3030 VIDEO MEASURING TOOL.: An article from: Imaging Update"
0,crummy crummy crummy,this is the worst movie i have ever seen! i turned it off it was so bad! i got it at wal-mart in like their $3 bin or something... they should have paid ME to get it!
0,Terrible,Another terrible release. Nothing new from the other DVDs. All the moves are similar to what she has already taught.
0,Loved the pot but it wasn't very durable.,"I loved this pot. I made soups and roast in it weekly. It was my favorite pot to cook in. Then one day while I was cooking up some onions in butter to make a soup, the enamel along the bottom started peeling off. I've not had this pot for a whole year yet. It should have lasted a lot longer than it has and I'm very disappointed with the quality."
0,Ehh..,I got this hoping it would be good. I only used it 3 times and it just stopped working and I don't know what to do.
0,Too Shiny For Me,"I thought that theStila Illuminating Liquid Foundation, 10 Watts, 1 Ouncewould be better for me than my off-the-shelf foundation that I got at Walmart. The Stila foundation was on backorder, so I didn't get it with the rest of my shipment (which includedStila Illuminating Powder Foundation Refill, 10 Watts, 0.34 Ounce) I'd planned to wear the powder version over the liquid version. When I tried this, it looked too fake. I tried the liquid foundation alone with my Marutaki Rice Powder I got some time ago from the VT Country Store. Better, but still too shiny for my taste. I ended up sending it back.Right now I've decided to wear (in this order) moisturizer, the Stila Beauty Balm, my Walmart liquid foundation topped with the powder version of the Illuminating Foundation. I top everything off with the Marutaki Rice Powder because it gives a nice matte finish. Sounds like a lot, but it works and looks really natural blended well."
1,The Beatles Love,"Great job on mixing many of the beatles hits. Love to listen to this while I am driving. Seems to have a great deal of energy,"
0,DONT buy it,"The sheets are listed as fleece but they are paper thin and make flannel look big and fluffy. The ""backside"" is a dreadful synthetic material and feels gross !!"
0,Terrible!!,"I don't even need to write a review on it...It's all been said here...The worst Movie I've ever seen in my life, and thats an understatement!Folks, trust all the negative comments...they are the correct ones."
1,White Hot by Sandra Brown,Love Sandra Brown and this is no exception. I also love audiobooks because I can listen to the books and get a lot of work around the house. I sit down for a couple of hours in the afternoon to work on needlework and listen to any audiobook. Very relaxing and enjoyable. Worth the purchase. It arrived in great shape and in excellant time just as promised.
1,COOK,I like it!I don't have 13 words to say & I don't see why its mandatory to have a lot to say about MY purchases ~ either I like it or don't like it ~ why do I have to write a book? why don't you simply put a brief description in the headliner or summary ~ you should be trying to make it easier for clients to want to leave feedback ~ this is to much work!
0,Great movie if you want your children picking up inappropriate language,This movie was horrible! Total inappropriate language throughout. I can't believe this is classified as a kids movie. I will be complaining to Redbox for listing this movie under family movies. It looks like it could have been cute if they didn't swear. Do not rent or buy this movie. It is AWFUL!!!
1,Nick'd once again...,"Toss in a healthy dose of Leonard Cohen poetics, a touch of David Byrne, and a splash of Rocky Horror Picture Show, and you can envision a Nick Cave afterworld.Nick is a 21st Century Rock and Roll god. The first album here rocks out a little more but the second one is perhaps even more brilliantly conceived. Both though, offer up the unique Nick Cave grooves, lyrics, and lush rocking arrangements that make him a true original. I especially found the piano work as satisfying as anything out there recently."
1,Not a dewalt fan,"Never been a dewalt fan, too many compromises and cut corners in quality. BUT if you can get this for about $60 brand new like I did, might as well! it is AC/DC too so it runs good off my welder."
1,A Great Book to Read,"a beautiful book to read and share w friends and loved one. i read this book at least twice a year from cover to cover, just a very comforting and truthful."
1,Beautiful Film,"First, people should be aaware this title from Italy plays fine in the US in the original English language audio and is much cheaper than the region-free version from Asia. Excellent trandfer with clear image and vibrant colors. I am still in the middle of watching it, and is a very worthwhile movie to own. PS - The soundtrack does not quite fit the theme and style of the film in some parts. I know it's a little picky, but it was just not in character with the film)"
0,far cry movie garbage,DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE. I am a big fan of the Far Cry games but this movie is crap. Plus the only way they are gonna make any money off this movie is by sueing people. Let them make their money that way since they can't make good movies. For the sake of all the people being sued by these idiots DO NOT buy this movie.
1,Privacy for Laptops!,"This product is remarkable. Discovered my need for it while typing a document on an airplane and I realized the sensitivity of the subject matter and the privacy expectations of my clients. The filter makes the screen black to persons sitting on either side, and does not at all diminish readability for the person using the computer."
1,Vonnegut's best,"I absolutely love KV. I have read 10 or so of his books and love them all.For a while, Mother Night was my favorite but Slapstick has dethroned it. It doesn't quite have the believable nature to it that Mother Night has but it is a great yarn. Vonnegution wisdom abounds in this book as it will make you laugh while ponder the words on the pages. It is filled with many of my favorite quotes from any of the books that I have read. This being said, I wouldn't start out with Slapstick as my first Vonnegut novel because it is very strange. I would read Cat's Cradle or one of his better known books before I read Slapstick."
1,Awesome!!!,"High energy, toe tapping music. A must have for the Celtic music lover.I love listening to Solas and the lead singer.Her voice is angelic and sends chills"
1,Light Indicator,"This product works great as long as people notice the light blinking, rather than being oblivious to it."
1,"Don't like the search button, but overall Excellent!","This is an excellent mouse. The shape is great and I love the Forward and Back buttons that you can push with your thumb. The only thing I don't like is the Search button near your fore finger. I tend to bump it by accident and a new browser window pops open. But that function can be disabled. Also, the extended battery life is awesome. I bought this a month ago and have not replaced the batteries. The mouse that this one replaced was getting so bad that it wasn't even a week for a set of batteries.Overall, a really great wireless mouse!"
0,Hardly any math,This is definitely not a software to reinforce math. It is more interactive play trying to figure out what Mia should do to move to the next screen. Once you get to the other screen then there is some math. This is more of a game than educational math. It is fun for kids on a video game perspective. The Mia's Reading Adventure: The Bugaboo Bugs is a better software that is definitely catered toward education.
0,A safe sex documentary,"This film is disappointing. The narration is distracting and tedious. What there is of the individual stories is interesting, but not worth suffering through endless sex education for the hopelessly ignorant."
0,a fancy expensive antenna with poor reception,"the antenna has the same reception power than a $20.00 (Radio Shack) antenna that I have before, but now the reception is ok since a adapted them together, I keep it just for the fancy looks but it wouldn't do better than any less expensive antenna."
1,WORKS!!,"I purchased this product over a year ago and saw results within two weeks! You must follow the instructions. Apply a cuticle oil (or any moisturizing oil) around the nail beds and apply the Mavala strengthener on the tips ONLY. Hold yours down until the product absorbs. I then massage the oil until it absorbs as well, then apply a base coat followed by nail polish. You can apply this product 2-3 times a week or whenever you're changing the color of the nail polish. I'd also recommend using protective gloves whenever you're doing dishes. My nails are visibly stronger and longer! Oh and the bottle lasts forever!"
0,so-so for an MMO,"I was sick of waiting for the expansion to WoW and had heard some good things about FFXI. The graphics were descent, but the character control was very ackward. I ended up canceling it before the 30 day trial and went back to playing my old standby of UO while I wait for BC."
0,Hadez Factor,Would have been great but film continued to freeze. Got tired of restarting. Gave up! My kind of movie so maybe will try again some day.
1,Stays Pretty True to the Book,"I liked the movie ""Sphere"" which was based on the wonderful novel by Mr. Michael Crichton. It is about a group of scientists who go underwater to study a spaceship that 'crashed' there. Inside the ship they find an odd sphere. Weird stuff then starts to happen.This movie could of been a lot better. They make the story kind of cheesy. Except it is a very good story on how people's minds work. The start of the movie starts out great but the movie makers screwed up the last 20 minutes. They also turned a great ending into a mediocre one that is just plain stupid.My suggestion is to read the great book first and then watch the movie. If you don't have time to read the book then watch the movie. ""Sphere"" is too good a thing to pass up. I give the movie four stars."
0,cleaner did not work,We bought this item to clean our expensive pots. It did not do a thing. Not sure of return policy but this product does not work.
1,Great for jewelry applications,"I got these specifically for polishing off blackening on jewelry I make. They didn't shred as badly as regular steel wool can, there were a few bits to pick out of the finished jewelry but not much at all. The small size of the pads makes them easy to use for smaller things like jewelry, and they didn't seem very harsh on my hands.Recommended if you use liver of sulfur on your copper or sterling pieces. I'm going to post a customer image to show what kind of threads I had on my wire jewelry."
0,"Too simplistic: 2 stars for EEs, 4-5 stars for embedded newbies","Ever used an A-to-D? Ever programmed in assembly language? Yeah? BING! You're well past the audience this book is written for.The format is OK, the material is clear, but I thought I was a-gonna get a book with design tricks and software that I could USE. There really isn't much of value here for the experienced designer/programmer. Oh well - I'll have to keep hunting.If you've never built any hardware, then maybe this really IS the book for you! Well, you best read the basic electronics stuff pretty carefully. Also, I'd go get a Texas Instruments eZ430-F2013 Development Tool for 20 bucks and save the kludge-together part of the exercise: you can get up and running faster with something that actually works right outa da box, plus it comes with basic software tools."
0,BORING-BORING-BORING,I HAD EXPECTED MORE ABOUT SPIRITUALITIY FROM THIS WORK BUT WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED TO READ MORE FAR OUT VIEWS ON THE AUTHORS OPINIONS OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THIS WORLD. I FELT ALOT OF ANGAR EMINATING FROM THIS WORK. COULD SOMEONE WHO SEEMS SO ANGRY REALLY BELIEVE IN THE LAW OF ONE? THIS BOOK CONTAINS MORE FICTION THAN SPIRITUALLITY AND I COULD NOT RECCOMMEND IT TO ANYONE.
0,"Cameras and Editing Miss Rage, Focus on Crowd","It's really too bad that the editors of this viedo were more interested in the crowd and circa 1990 Bon Jovi camera angle changes every 2 seconds then they were the guys. No, it's not bad, but it fails to convey the energy like the previous DVD did.If you had to buy only one Rage DVD, buy the one before this one. It illustrated the energy as well as the crowd far better.This DVD is so polished it's uncharacteristically synthetic for Rage.That said, the sound is outstanding and they're still angry. And they use the media mogules against themselves which I respect."
0,Good -- For a While,"I used this machine almost daily for two years. My only complaint is the steam wand's detachable cover that promotes gunk inside the wand and is difficult to clean. That and the instruction manual that is so full of typos it looks like it was written by my preschooler. However, the machine worked well otherwise and I definitely got my money's worth out of it. I stored the machine unused for ten months. This morning I fired it up again, and a lot of what I believe were hard water deposits came out, enough to block the water flow. This despite the fact that I previously used filtered water 99% of the time. It's impossible to see inside the machine to see what the issue is. Two rounds of white vinegar and four rounds of plain filtered water later, I still have a lot of particles coming out of the machine, too many to be acceptable for drinking. I will most likely be throwing the machine away now."
1,Okay these kids can't sing .. but neither can my kids...,"All my girls ages 2, 7, and 10, love this disc. They also like music by ""real"" recording artists but this is really fun for them to sing along to and if they like it then I think it fufills it's purpose (which is to entertain kids, not adults). I also like that they can hear popular music without having to worry about unsuitable lyrics."
1,Arc - The Movie,Received movie in good condition and enjoyed this unique film which has quality actors. Blake Robbins was especially convincing as the father of the missing child.
0,poor quality,"This rack is barely usable to hang mugs on. The pegs are wobbly and loose and the whole frame is flimsy. As I tried to hang it, the hanging loop bent and fell off. I would not trust any mugs to this rack! I also tried to hammer small brads into the end of the pegs to prevent the mugs from falling off (as I have done with other mug racks) and the pegs splintered and broke. Unless you want broken mugs, do not buy this rack!"
0,It was okay.,I watched this because there was nothing else to watch. Nothing was ever resolved in the movie and it was really wierd.
0,You get what you pay for...,"For the price, what can you expect? It's a poor-quality, made in China product. The colours are a little off (the blue is way too dark), but that's not a huge deal. The second time I raised it in a moderately windy day, the bottom grommet ripped through.If you're looking for something to just hang in your dorm window or something, this will do. Don't expect to use it as a real flag though."
0,Not up to par,I have all Tim Wilson's CDs and may I say this one is the only one that has ever been a disappointment.
0,Separating the Hansons!,"Hanson has been so fortunate about their long awaited success. Interviews, radio shows, and specials on entertainment shows have them explaining to people that they don't like being separated. Hanson is about three guys in a band, and not about any individual person. Taylor (the central theme of this book) has been known to exlaim his opinions of being separated from the other two, disliking the title of ""lead singer,"" or ""favorite Hanson."" I think this novel is inappropriate, most of the information inside is false, and because of their attitude towards novels with this idea, it makes it less appealing to fans. If they don't want to be portrayed in this way, then I would refrain from doing so. The author of this novel, has taken someone in the Entertainment industry she knows will be a big seller with 10 year olds who have nothing better to read. It's a book I do not recommend, it is exactly what they do not want happening."
0,transparencies suck,"Do not buy this printer if you plan to print transparencies. I bought it to print a lot of transparencies. In your hand they look good, but when I put them on the projector, the colors all show up as different shades of gray. A big waste of my money."
0,Covers fell off immediately,"The paper is fine, but the spiral binding is of poor quality. The front and back cover of the book fell off in the first five minutes of use."
0,Disappointing buy,I was distracted by mistakes and typos. Book is only good for die-hard fans who collect EVERY piece of GWTW memorabilia. Better off watching the film again or re-reading the original book. Doesn't come close to David O'Selznick's Hollywood; Memo from David O'Selznick or The Road to Tara.
0,WARNING!!,"This is not the Steve Harris from Iron Maiden!!!!! I notice people have bought products to do with Iron Maiden have also bought this!! This is some sort of R'n'B act!! This is not metal!! This is not a solo project from Maiden!!!!If you really want some non-Maiden stuff with Maiden members, pick up any solo work by Bruce Dickinson, it features Janick Gers on guitar!! :)"
0,Junk Cables,"I purchased a few of these cables because they were so cheap and it's always handy to have a couple of these hdmi cables around. Well, only one of the cables actually worked. Two of them partially work with poor picture quality, noise, dropped sound, etc. One flat out doesn't work at all. So for 10 bucks I ended up get a decent cable out of it, which is about what you'll get for a good one so you really shouldn't bother with buy this product."
0,***Blackout***You'll***Wish***,"When a movie panders to the star's appeal in one useless elongated opening shower scene, you should know what to expect ahead. Kate's tough gal schtick ran out its welcome not long after she opened her mouth.The unimaginative appearances of the killer, red herring, trap hole, mind-(D)umbing final twist and the 'whiteout', GEEZ.... can these elements be more stupifying cinematically in their timing? Then again, this is the same uber-auteur for Gone in 60 Seconds and Swordfish.One star for the Antarctica setting and one star for the scientists who ran across the pond naked. Who said geeks can't party? Too bad I didnt while watching this, maybe I would have blacked out this crapola."
0,Don't buy this rip off,"I ran it for three summers total - bought expensive tanks of propane (about 3 per summer) and the replacement attractants... to catch a grand total of 10 mosquitos.A rolled up newspaper is cheaper, as is going inside."
1,Magnificant Story of Bravery and Gallantry!,"I found The Three Musketeers to be perhaps the greatest novel I've ever read! Porthos, Athos, Aramis, and d'Artagnan are truly my favorite literary charactors of all time. I especially like the chapters where the Musketeers are chasing Lady De Winter all over England and France. If you've ever wanted to read this book, I'd suggest that you do, you'll never be able to put it down!"
1,great,Kids loved this movie. We had never seen it before and they were thrilled with being able to watch it!
0,terrible,Unable to watch a message says unable to stream but I was charged like I seen the movie. I orders it three times
1,Nice way to help clean up cable clutter,"Very nice power center, especially for the price! I needed something to protect my new home theater system, because my old power strip wasn't going to cut it. This was also very helpful in getting my tangled mess of power cords in order and labeled. The coax connectors were a little tight, but I was able to get the cables screwed on without too much trouble. Mine came with an extra coax and phone connector which was a nice surprise."
1,"Plush Raj White Tiger 16""",I would have to say this is a very cute tiger and my shipping was quick. He does have a soulful look about him and very soft
1,great for all fitness levels,"I've been doing this tape for about 2 weeks...it gives a suprising good strength workout using the toning cords. Also, you will sweat a lot so this makes it a combination muscle building/cardio workout. Richard is encouraging and the people in the tape are of all sizes. Get it!!! I weigh 256 lbs and I can do it!"
0,Awful,"I can't say enough bad about this book. Fortunately I only paid $1.00 for it at a used book store. A silly story written to please those with execessive macho proclivities, I guess. Given that he had written Absolute Power on which the movie was based, I stuffed the urge to throw it away many times as my reading progressed, thinking I'd come to some redeeming value. I didn't. Now I'll throw it away."
0,totalmente desilusionante,"Este libro es muy malo ya que no contiene ningun ritual verdadero para la buena suerte cuando lo lei senti deceos de tirarlo a la basura solo contiene tips que son meras superticiones demasiado malos que ni siquiera por sugestion harian efecto algunoy eso me desconcerta por que el autor conoce de rituales muy buenos y verdaderos pues son mas valiosos los pequenos folletos que se venden con recetas magicas de el, mi recomendacion es que tiras tu dinero si compras este libro. mas bien este libro se deveria de llamar le libro de la MALA suerte por que que mala suerte que lo haya comprado"
1,This is where it all started!,Weller 18 a 60s obsessed mod teen takes speed sees the Pistols live and combines his love for soul and R&B with the fire of the who and the emerging punk scene. Is it a great record?- no but its a vital energetic youthful stab of music that would begin the career of the Uk's best songwriter youth icon. Plus there are some great tunes In the City Away from the numbers etc. This is a snapshot of London circa 1977 and though never punk Weller was the essential rebel and no one looked better and more determined than Paul. The Jam were to become the essential British rock band outside of the Clash and weller has gone on to this very day to be one of the best songwriters of our Generation. And better still the Jams legacy is untarnished and still sounds refreshing today!!!
1,World Class Security Reference,"This book is a rare example of excellant background material and real world examples. The author's understanding of the intracacies of the Windows security model is unmatched. The writting style is easy to follow and even from time-to-time funny.The text is so chocked full of keen insights, I find something new everytime I re-read a chapter. If you're working on a project that requires understanding Windows Security (and what windows project doesn't), I strongly recommend you grab a copy of this book.There is only a single criticism I can make about this book, and that's about the binding. The cover is poorly attached stiff paper. After reading it a few times (ok, maybe a few dozen times...), the cover came off, and needed to be reattach (twice). The book now looks like it has been through a battle. For a reference text of this importance, hard cover binding would have been more appropriate."
0,Up to usual standards!,"The standards being excellent! This is a warm, witty, and charming example of mystery writing. Quill is no hard boil 40's type and neither are is three favorite companions, even if this one leaves them all a bit singed around the edges. This book is a fun and funny romp for the weekend armchair sleuth. As usual her characters are real, and human / feline as the case may be. The setting is becoming more developed as each book progresses though a novice to the cat who series can jump right in and not get lost. Well written, engaging plot entertaining characters, are combined well to create a comfortable place for any reader to climb in and enjoy a visit with old friends."
0,Not recommended,"I think that this product would be great if it wasn't so poorly made. As soon as I took it out of the box it was broken. I should have returned it right away, however, instead we decided to try it just using the velcro and the thing just does NOT stay in place and even if it was not broken it still wouldn't have worked properly. Definitely over priced and a waste of money.It gets in the way of the infant car seat."
0,et tu rutger?,"during the reformation, the great schism ignited by martin luther between roman catholicism and the new protestantism of the north, luther compared rome to sodom, and scaled sodom as the runner up...the war that ensued included every atrocity that could be imagined, such as the impaling of individuals on sharpened tree limbs, roasting them over a slow fire, and slashing open the bellies of pregnant women and flinging their unborn children to ravenous dogs...in other words, it was a fairly ordinary war...but i have little taste for such spectacles, and i find it difficult to believe that an actor of rutger's stature would immerse himself to the ears in a slasher movie that attempts, however futilely, to outrevulse all contenders...at least the trailer gives fair warning, but the high rating it is accorded by critics who have damned to near death films of real quality, with tedious cavils and faint praises, is entirely outrageous."
0,Disappointed,"We ordered this kit for a beginner at stamp collecting. We expected the album to be free-form, so he could save the stamps that he likes. Instead the album has pages for specific years, starting in 1901, and photos of specific stamps for many of the spaces. I'm not a stamp collector myself, and maybe this is a standard format, but it's not at all what we wanted. The Guide is okay, and the magnifying glass is inexpensive but okay. But we ordered the kit primarily for the album, and it's collecting dust on a shelf."
1,One of the all time great film books,"This is seriously the best book on movies I've ever read. With a few exceptions--""White Zombie,"" ""Murder by Television""--these films are totally unknown. Until now.Every movie in here was put out by the lesser-known studios--Monogram,Mascot,Chesterfield,ect. The book covers a wide range of sub-genres, from jungle exploitation films to action serials to sinister westerns, so long as there are vague horror elements.The authors have done a great service, and their writing style is very eloquent. By all means purchase this and seek out some of these films."
0,I can't believe they left out the BEST line!!,"Great movie, but one of the BEST lines from the theatre and VHS version of Last of the Mohicans is: ""Do not try to understand them and do not make them understand you for they are a breed apart and do not make sense."" We got the director's cut DVD and although it has the great ""big message"" ending, it is missing the above line (and from what I understand, also others).In summary, video quality was good for us but the scenes are jumpy and the audio pretty bad.DVD version not worth the purchase. Stick with the VHS version"
1,LONG LIVE INSPECTOR CHAN OF THE HONOLULU P.D!,"It's been 3 years since Charlie Chan films were knocked off the Fox Movie channel thanks to the meddling of the P.C. special interest groups. Well, the wait has paid off as these films are coming to dvd. This first collection will not only consist of four great films: Charlie Chan In London (1934), Charlie Chan In Paris (1935), Charlie Chan In Egypt(1935) and Charlie Chan in Shanghai (1935). But among the bonuses, we get Eran Trece, a Spanish Language Charlie Chan film made in (1931) Here's a list of all the extras in this set:The Legacy of Charlie Chan Featurette - 15minsIn Search of Charlie Chan Featurette - 20 minsThe Real Charlie Chan Featurette - 20 minsEran Trece Fullscreen Feature (1931) - 79 minsCharlie Chan In London Theatrical TrailerEran Trece Theatrical TrailerKudos to Fox Home Video for having the backbone to finally release these films to us mystery lovers.

0,Would love to try this phone out but won't install,"I've heard such great things about this phone and was really looking forward to trying it out. Unfortunately the phone won't work with my computer and its frustrating that the Linksys wasn't clear about this. It works only with 32bit versions of windows--urgggg! I've got XP x64 and it craps out on the install. Various message boards are saying there are ways but it requires a bit of hacking to make it happen.I'm sure its a great phone, but beware that if you have a 64bit operating system you may have woes!"
0,2 stars and I am being VERY generous,"One star - for the fabulous cast which was ridiculously under-utilized, one - for the fact that I was able to finish watching this joke of a movie.It is amazing that this group of great actors and directors was able to produce such a pointless film. When you find yourself thinking: What is it all about? Where is this going? 50 minutes into the movie, it is a sign that it is not that good. My husband gave up after that, but I (a patient viewer as I am), kept watching till the end, hoping that something good would happen. No luck there. There was no cohesive plot, no moral, no point.People who give this movie 4 and 5 stars must be either star-struck or huge fans of Coen brothers.I am sure glad that I didn't go to the movie theater to watch this film and didn't buy it either. Thank god for public libraries!"
0,Ugh.,"If it was possible to rate this film at zero I would. It's that bad.Usually I can find a redeeming quality in a film... in this one the only redeeming quality is that it finally does end. I love gory movies; my friend and I cheered during the Saw movies, but this one just aimed to gross people out and get a reaction. There were a few moments where I actually thought I would throw up. Other scenes were little more than bad imitations of cheap porn. I can tolerate the black and white. I can tolerate the limited dialogue, I can even tolerate it having a stupid plot, but the cheap stunts and grotesqueness are intolerable. Don't bother watching it, The Human Centipede 2 is a far cry from the original."
0,i give them points for trying,"what could have been an interesting and intellectual combination of styles turns out to be a bit of a disappointment. had atreyu combined all the best aspects of metal (technical, heavy guitars), emo (smart, heartfelt, emotional lyrics), and hardcore (unbridled energy), i would have enjoyed this immensely. unfortunately, they didn't combine these aspects as well as perhaps they could have. it seems that they try way too hard to be gothic and depressed and use some of the stereotypes and cliches of 80's metal, while trying to be hardcore by screaming over all the tracks.a bit of a disappointment, but its the trendy thing now, so if your into the whole scene-kid thing, this might please you. but i think that it could have been much better."
0,And the gaping hole in this theory is...,only the Khazar elite converted to the Jewish faith there are plenty of archeological expeditions that have uncovered burials from the same period that are monotheistic in origin. the experts of Molecular Population Genetics would also have something to say on the matter.
0,Ah Jeez is right!,"I really wasn't going to review this book, but on a whim was browsing the other reviews when I came upon the 'Ah Jeez...' review and there I was, LOL. Seriously, I couldn't stop laughing because I believe that phrase was used about 14 times in the novel. I kept thinking about Lucas Davenport and then would have to reread the previous paragraph (wondering if Lucas would have said that).To be fair though, Mr. Sanford I'm sure would love to paint another scene or sing a new type of song...so that's what he did. Jake Winter is an interesting guy. He could have been developed a little more. But hey, thanks for the try Senor Sanford.Big takeaway: Never, ever trust a politician if they're breathing!"
1,THE BOOK IS AN EXCELLENT ENDING. . . OR IS IT?!,"This book is ultra-rare, so if you can get a copy, keep it. I stole mine from the public library. The book visits some of the old Spacer worlds from the Robot novels, and it is interesting to see how time has treated them. This book also provides incite into the WHOLE Foundation series! THIS IS A MUST!!!!!"
0,Worst product,"Some serious problem with the lamp. Probably the worst thing I have purchased on Amazon.1. several days after normal use, it started emitting an obnoxious smell similar to what laser printer would smell during printing. After 30 minutes, the room is filled with this smell causing headache and nauseous. I'm certain it is not the heat burning the plastic. For whatever reason, this smell cannot be good for health.2. the rubber feet material left circular brown marks on my daughter's otherwise beautiful white desk. Tried all kinds of cleaners but didn't help. Not only I cannot use this lamp because of the terrible smell problem, it also ruined my furniture.3. contacted manufacture. they want you to pay the shipping to them, as well as $18 return shipping back to you. Not worth it."

1,Great buy for backup,So good to know I have these for later. Love the system! I highly recommend it for single people. No need to make a lot of coffee everyday to waste.
1,PERFECT!,"What a great CD! Completely takes the work out of putting together your own ceremony CD. We aren't having live musicians play so this suits our needs perfectly! The CD booklet tells you when each song would be appropriate (precessional, recessional, interludes, etc.)and everything! The music is your classic wedding music, nothing funky. I believe ALL the songs are instrumentals."
1,Do you scream for ice cream?,"Nice source of recipes, I enjoyed the writer's style as well as the recipes. Ever try to eat your way through a cookbook? Delicious. The ice cream that is."
1,Best bang for buck,"This camera is great. UPS delivered it today and I have been bowled over by all the features that I didn't know it had. The photos are very sharp--I can't imagine needing more than 2 megapixels. The 20-second video mode is neat, too. The camera does use batteries like crazy though. Using the LCD instead of the viewfinder takes some adjustment, but is superior in my opinion. The LCD is super-bright and crisp. After using it for a short time today, I have already gone through the supplied Panasonic batteries! I recommend some powerful rechargable batteries for this unit."
1,THIS IS WORTH COLLECTING ..........,"i have read everything , from sydney sheldon to ken follet but i must bow down to the MASTER.Its a tragedy this great writer is not on this earth to treat us anymore but he has left his legacy behind.Whoever wants to read a masterpiece should give this 1 a try.This 1 is a collectors item.i dont want to repeat the cliche....but DONT MISS IT."
1,Pudo haber sido mejor!!,"Con la colaboracion de Warner Latina, este cd+dvd promocional del canal HTV por lo menos en el cd trae una buena seleccion de temas, lamentablemente en el dvd incluye solo 6 videos (todos estos videos estan disponibles en otros dvds que Warner ha sacado al mercado, asi que no son muy novedosos que digamos...) aun asi es un bonito ""souvenir"" para todas las personas que han disfrutado de la programacion y han hecho de este canal uno de sus favoritos"
1,"Great bed for camping, if your tent has the space","Very comfortable for camping and plenty of room for my wife, myself, and our infant son. We just bought a very large (16'x7') tent, with plenty of room for the bed, the pack and play and all of our stuff, but this would not fit in our old 4 man tent. Used 4 nights so far and has been pretty good at holding air, but may need a quick refill after first night."
1,good for a newbie,"For a newbie, this CD is a great way to ease into the world of Phish. While Junta is a better example of what Phish is really about, this CD is a fantastic selection of catchy songs that could bring anyone into being a phan. Newer fans might not enjoy some of the stranger, lenghty songs on other CDs so this album is perfect for newcomers. Ignore the comments from other fans of phish if you're a newbie. While they perform some of these songs much better in concert, the CD is still great and you won't be let down when you hear them in concert. Phans might stay away, but newbies should flock to this one."
1,Excellent DVD!!!,"This is an excellent compilation of the original Get Smart series! Brought back many memories! An excellent value for the price, too!"
0,Doesn't hold up,"The rods the shoes sit on are metal while the frame is plastic. It fits five pairs of women's heels and sandals or four of wider shoes, such as sneakers, slippers, boots and flip-flops. I bought it a couple months ago and it has already collapsed under the weight of just the shoes it could fit. Interestingly, it wasn't the bottom rack that failed which had my sneakers, slippers and flip-flops on, it was the middle and top which had five pairs of heels and sandals on each row. Hmm...."
0,Short circuit!,The AT&T 436 had a short-circuit after 3 months of use. It brought our phone line to its knees. It took a Verizon technician an hour to trace our phone trouble to one little caller-ID box gone bad. Our phone line was out for two days.
1,The Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle/Claudette C. and Fred McMurray,This is another great and also alot to learn from. Love these old shows.You will love it. Great quality on this VHS and great quality actors andactresses. These old movies are wonderful to watch because this is whatreally good acting is all about. Bring home those yesteryears and enjoythe true foundation of acting.
0,much worse than sonicare,"My sonicare battery was running low, so I bought this because of the low price. Don't waste your money, it's much much worse than the sonicare. The sonicare brush vibrates back and forth against your teeth. The ultrasonex is much less sophisticated and vibrates in all directions, so half the time it's actually banging directly into your teeth. It felt very harsh on my gums.It looks and feels like somebody just stuck a toothbrush on the end of what in polite company would be called a ""marital aid""."
0,Do not buy this of #$#@#!,This is worst product I've ever purchased. First they claim they will send you a rebate which I've never got and it's been more than 2 months already. The speed is not even close to what they claim. Take my comments to heart and don't make the mistakes that I've made. Amazon should ban this product from their site as it looks really bad to carry a non reputable vendor that doesn't live up their claims.
0,Microsoft Office Professional 2007,When I made the order it was for global use. But the product you shipped was specifically for Asia. Why did you send such a product to the USA.Secondly the product is for the installers only who have whatever tney call an installation key.This product was just a rip off of my money as I cannot use it in my US computer.
0,Deconstruction for Beginners,"I bought this book in order to gain a better understanding of Deconstructive theory. I was open to the comic book format which is quite fun, and the illustrator,Joe Lee,captures the feel of underground comics. I didn't enjoy the pornographic nature of the writing. Jim Powell's explanations for deconstructive theory are at times entrenched in direct references to sexual acts and male and female genitalia. I'm not a fan of porn, and most people who are interested in deconstructive theory are probably not either.Despite the fact that the writer's lewd and carnally juicy explanations are helpful in understanding deconstruction,I didn't enjoy reading it. After a sincere effort at gleaning the information I was looking for, I threw this book in the trash."
1,superdope!!,"This silverware is amazing, way better than that plastic crap those greasy trailer park boys use. Can't go wrong getting these babies. Good call"
0,Were these recipes tested???,"Like other reviewers, I thought the organization and look of the book was spot on. But, and it's a big but, the finished product didn't turn out as it looked in the picture. For instance, the butterscotch blondies melted before they could set up, and so were a mess...but they sure tasted good. So now I'm reluctant to try any other recipes."
0,Disappointing,Not having been familiar with the production ( or the related album ); but looking forward to a collection of John Denvers' best songs; I purchased the download. The arrangements were all different and the vocals did not sound at all like the John Denver I had always enjoyed. If you are looking for John Denvers' greatest hits; this isn't it.
1,best of the best,This DVD seemed to display all of my favorite Gordon Lightfoot songs in a well- orchestrated order that flowed flawlessly from beginning to end. I hated for it to end.
1,Small Town America,River Season is a snapshot of growing up in Small Town America that keeps you captured from page 1. It is heart warming and full of the kind of teenage pranks that kept small town kids entertained in the 1970's. I thought it was better than Stand By Me and highly recommend author Jim Black's books.
1,You'll never want another tooth brush again!,I have LOVED this toothbrush. I even bought the kids their own. No messy tooth paste in the sink and on the counter. This product was highly recommended by my dentist. Once you try it you won't be satisfied with the own fashioned toothbrush
0,Thank God this is Out Of Print,"What crap is this? Releasing albums like this is what started Michael Bolton's carrerr. This was just painful to listen to. I remember Kane from Alice Cooper and from his first solo cd back in 89. This had one hit on it, so I guess you can call Kane Roberts ""A One Hit Wonder."" He disappeard from the music realm after this and I would to after releasing this album. Bitting of the saw blade on the back cover that makes no sense to me cause this is nothing like a roaring blade. This was very painful to listen to. I can describe it for you as if I was listening to birds churpping outside my window when the sun first comes up. I don't know which one is worse."

0,Not a good administration guide,"When I purchased this book I was in the process of upgrading several Websphere servers from 3.5 to 4.0. I was looking for a book to help understand some of the administrative features of 4.0(security, performance tuning, application troubleshooting). Of the 1000 pages only about 250 are related to administering Websphere. The rest of the book reads more like a Java programming refrence. There is some coverage for administration but not much detail. A good example of this is the Windows installation instructions. The book breezes over the install in two pages. The Linux install is given even less coverage and there is little mention of other platforms. I ended up going back to the IBM Redbooks.If I had to choose of the administration resources currently available I would start with the Redbooks, then the Websphere Application Server Bible and lastly this book."
1,Good value and selection,"This assortment should be sufficient for most folks around the house. I have purchased these as gifts and they have been well received, especially for sets to be put in lake houses, RV's, and for folks who aren't professional mechanics, but need a tool occasionally. I combined them with some of the drill bit assortment sets Amazon offers, and they make a nice combo. These are not professional grade tools, so don't buy them if you make a living with tools. These are for the homeowner."
1,GReat! fast shipping! As described,Everything was good. shipped fast. it was exactly like described. i would buy from them again.

0,Jessica try again!!!,"it is time for Jessica to sing songs that fits a woman. This bubblegum type of music is just horrendous. The lyrics are the ones of a teenage girl. Sorry but this cd is a big disapointment. If you want something meaningful, you better run away from this one. I heard that she is dating John Mayer now. If it is so, than you should seek help from him for your next record."
0,I tried to like it but I can't,I'm usually a big fan of vamp books with a good twist of humor but I can't quite get into this series. Just too superficial and I'm not getting too attached to the main character. I really wanted to like it particularly since I enjoyed Jeanne Stein's vamp series and she's plugged his books on websites and such but they don't really work for me.

0,"Good Theory, Vague and Outdated Code","This book is a good start for those who want to work on the guts of their own mud. The target audience seems to be accomplished C++ programmers. The author assumes a great deal of expertise on the part of the reader; I for one was left in the dark on many topics.The code examples on the companion CD are not fully explained in the book, and I found several code snippets in the source files that had no mention at all in the relevant chapters. The code examples also will not compile on newer versions of GCC without a great deal of work.This book is a good intro to network programming, and does a good job of outlining what is needed to design and code a MUD from scratch, but I would stay away if you are not already an accomplished programmer."
0,what happened to the quality?,"I've been buying ON's products for well over a year now and have been very happy with them. In fact, when I shop for protein powder, creatine, etc, I first look for something from ON's line. But something must have changed recently, because while this is the same protein powder I've bought before, this recent shipment is really disappointing. It tastes bitter, and doesn't mix well at all. What happened? Something definitely is off. I wish I hadn't bought a 10 pound bag of the stuff, it's not going to be pleasant choking this stuff down for the next few months."

0,Find another station,"I've read both Darwin's Radio and its successor, Darwin's Children. The real star of the show here is the evolutionary change itself. Bear's 2D characters drag both books down. Unfortunate, because this would make for a great SF read if the characters weren't so single-minded & cardboardlike."

0,Bose wave radio has poor FM reception,This radio has good sound and plays CDs great but its FM reception is horrible. If you have flourescent lights anywhere near the radio it picks up distortion. I tried the optional FM antenna that Bose sells and it still does not get good reception. I called Bose and the service tech on the phone said that his own Wave radio also has this problem but that the company would not take it back. All they offered was another FM antenna hookup and I will have to go to RAdio Shack and purchase a better antenna. For $500 the radio ought to work. I have a 20 year old Panasonic Boom box in the same area and it works fine with the flourescent lights on. This is my first and last Bose product. Check the internet others have also complained about the same FM reception issues.
1,G.I. Joe & Lilly,This book was a beautiful love story of a true American Hero. G.I. Joe was a very lucky man to have such an loving and understanding wife. I admire both of them for their service to the United States and for their commitment to each other through good times and hard times. A wonderful story.
1,Cute puppy toy!,My puppy loves this little toy -- I just wish it were brown instead of grey -- it looks too much like a mouse!
1,Probably The Best Album I've Ever Heard (or ever will),"Where do i begin? From the word go stabbing westward's darkest days hits you like a punch in the face. It's the most amazing album i've ever heard. Chris Hall's vocals soar so high and grab your attention with such awesome power it's hard to stop listening. I have'nt stopped listening to it for five months since i bought it. The only bad thing i would have to say is that the three songs in the middle to tend to drag on and break from the rest of the songs. You Complete Me, Waking Up Beside Me and On Your Way Down are some of the most emotional songs i've ever had the good fortune to hear. I had to pay twicw as much for it because i live in the UK and they are hard to get here but it was worth every penny. Buy it now."
0,Pages keep turning while me toes stay curled;)~,"All of Marly's books are great..I just wish there were more books to read! I have to say I have several authors on Ellora Cave that I love and she is one of them!Keep the book coming, Marly!"
1,"Hard to trust a value brand, isn't it?","In April 2003 (six months before this writing) I was dimly aware that I was running out of CD-Rs, and so when Amazon's front page confronted me with this cheap spindle of something called ""KHypermedia"" I actually paid attention instead of clicking on through. I'm usually wary of value brands of anything, especially those I've only seen online, but because these discs were on sale from an already very low price, and because I was ordering something anyway, I clicked them into my cart.I've now burned dozens of music CDs, video CDs, and data storage CDs from this spindle, and they've all been fine and remain so. No skips, no coasters, no degradation over time --- in short, no difference from any other CD-Rs I've used. If this is the best per-disc price you've seen on this particular shopping trip, go for it."
1,Perfect for kids!,"I bought this for my 1 1/2 year old to wear while we were in Hawaii on vacation. It provided lots of sun protection - for his face, head, ears, and neck. It also stayed on with the tie srtaps, even though some days were quite windy. He now wears the hat each time we go for a walk. It is a good substitute for, or in addition to putting sunscreen on. It is a high quality hat."
1,super!,Excellent Book for the casual or just sorta interested in physics type of person. was very easy to read and explained the ideas very well!
0,"Right size, wrong flag","Good size and quality, however, it was the wrong flag. Rather than getting the USSR flag, I got a United States Marine Corps flag, not that I don't like the Marine Corps, I just want the flag that I paid for."
0,Glad someone liked it,"I, too, like one of the other reviewers, had trouble with the S-video connects: both were bad. Took it back for another, and this one was defective, also.Another example of gettigng what you pay for. There's a good reason that the next cheapest (name brand) recorder is $150 more..."
1,YUM!!,"We were running to the park last night and I stopped in the grocery store for a few snacks to bring along. I bought a 5-oz box of these crackers for $3.99. My son has autism and is *extremely* picky about what he will eat, it is almost impossible to get him to try something new. But I was hoping he'd give these a try.I was amazed that he took a bite of these...and LOVED them! He hate half the box at the park! My 2-year-old and 11-month-old also enjoyed them, and I had to stop myself from stealing the box.I am not a big fan of Ritz bits...I don't like the processed, ""fake cheese"" taste of them. The cheese on these tastes so much better."
1,Thought provoking,Emmet Fox always presents a new way of looking at life. The truth really will set you free.
1,another winner from Dave Hunter,"Buy it! If you have any interest at all in how your guitar amplifier works, you need this book - I can't recommend it anymore than that! Dave has authored more books from Publisher Backbeat Books, and they're all killer productions - great/informative writing, superb binding, covers and great detail in the publishing aspects of these books.Dave Hunter is well versed in all things guitar, as I have learned through buying and reading all of his works to date. He's got a unique book here in his approach and honesty on the subject, and it's worth every penny. Loaded with real world, no BS information - great sections on signal chain, components, how to select the right amp for you and at the end, a fully documented amplifier kit (which is now available through the publisher's website) which you can either buy direct, or put together with your own parts!Highly recommended, and I highly recommend Dave's other books as well!"
1,Hands-On Writing Tools for Young Writers,I enjoyed this book. It gave some very practical advice on creating a workshop environment for writing in the Intermediate grades. I have used the ideas (modified) with younger writers and they are equally as beneficial.I think this is a must have for anyone who would like to put some Umphhh back into writing in the classroom.
0,Worst of the Indiana Jones Releases,After so many years of being without Indiana Jones it would seem that they would have thought more on the topic of their latest release. Surewith the special effects of the series in years gone by it would be hard to assume it could be a reality. However this movie was so far fetched it really didn't make sense.The movie also didn't have substance. The story in the movie was just as if they put this whole storyboard together in 6 hours. With the lack of a great storyline that was expected as in years gone by I would guess this will be the last in the series. If they do come up with another movie then I do hope they will at least give it some thought.In short - Save Your Money or at least wait until it's in the $5.00 bins at your local retail store. I would have given it a lower review but they don't give you an option for negative stars.
1,Better than Strunk and White for business people,Extremely easy to read and understand. The section on charts is exceptional!
1,Not bad for an emulation.,"I purchased this a day ago, and did lose boredom instantly and got hooked.Galaga, etc. are all my classical favourites!I recommend it for those people who want to bright up their past by playing their old school arcade games once again.But the only problem with this is that your high-scores get wiped out and aren't saved. I could've rated it a 4.5 if their was a choice."
0,I do NOT recommend,"I was diagnosed with coeliac/celiac (spelling depends on which side of the Atlantic you are on) as an infant. Inadvertantly (on reflection) given the green light to eat gluten when I was 12 and then back to full-blown Coeliac/Celiac 20yrs later. Growing up in Europe it was much easier to live gluten-free. However, I bought this book to help make the adjustment to living gluten-free in the US. This book just broke my heart in terms of an overzealous mother who I was relying on to help and this book failed in so many ways. Knowing the way of gluten-free, I really felt this book misguided at best. Please find another way than buy this book.A little trick, internet searches using the European spelling ""COELIAC"" will guide you to sites, agencies etc that have more information. The US is a great place but behind the 8-ball on Celiac and this author, epitomizes such."
1,The single best book written on street theatre.,"Harrison-Pepper's descriptions of the performances and players of Washington Square are top-rate, but it's with her analysis of street performance that she really shines. She explains ""the street as stage"", how the script of such performances is written between the performer and the audience, and how they turn ""city space"" into ""theater place"". I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to be a street performer, wants to understand street theatre, or who ever watches such performances and wants to do so from a knowing perspective.And, perhaps amazingly, what Harrison-Pepper writes about has wonderful applications to business. So, whether you're in the business of theatre or the theatre of business, read this book!"
0,Great if you are easily entertained and satisfied,"This DVD is a great example of how Hilary gets by on her looks. Includes making and videos of ""So Yesterday""/""Why Not"", and a short version of the video ""I Can't Wait"". Includes home videos and photos of Hilary when she was younger, and less annoying. As far as Hilary in the studio, it includes performances of ""Little Voice"" and ""So Yesterday"" which are both lip synched, as anyone who has common sense could tell that. They also show bits of performances of some other songs on her album, also lip synched. So you see no live singing here. Just Hilary faking it."
0,an unbelievably small amount of ink,"Print quality is fine, but holy moly, you can maybe get 100 pages out of each cartridge. I'm changing them very frequently so overall the cost of each page is much higher than it should be. I wouldn't be surprised to find out that these 92's are only used in low cost printers, as HP is probably using their low output to subsidize the cost."
0,The worst move ever made!,If there was a rating of less than 1 star- or actually negative number of stars- this movie is worthy. A friend claimed they had seen the worst movie ever made- Jason X- but I assured him I could top it!! I was glad the movie was so cheap when I looked it up so I could prove my point. I'd have never spent $10 or more on it. There is no part of this move I didn't hate. But if horrible movies are you thing this is the one for you!
1,Fast and easy!,"Love this book! I tried the easiest ball and it only took me about 2 hours to complete. I stitched it by hand. Fun and addicting! These would be great for new babies, toddlers, and even big kids! I will be making many more!The instructions are very easy to follow and are well written."
0,THIS PRODUCT IS A FRAUD!!!,"I ordered this SO CALLED Honey Powder from BARRY FARMS ~ it is a FRAUD !! It is not HONEY POWDER. It isWHEAT with something else mixed with it. It does not dissolve, it DOES NOT have HONEY in the mix. On topof their frauding the public, they make sure you cannot return it and get a refund. They should bereported for the fraudelent manner they are operating.I THREW both bags in the trash."
0,anemic sound,"I bought this system b/c of the raves review given by the users and the JVC brand. I was disappointed after unpacking and listening to my favorite cd. The sound quality is beyond bad. It doesn't produce full spectrum of music notes, and it even distorts the notes to a point that it's very noticeable to any untrained ears. I was playing just new age music, not even the more dynamic classical music . I can't imagine how bad it would sound with classicals.put things into perspective, I only need a compact unit in my treatment room to play for my clients during their meditation session. This unit sounds so bad that it can't even serve for this simple purpose. It's going back to walmart."
0,BURN AFTER WACTHING!!,"burn after waching is more like it. or maybe burn before watching, would be even better. there was lots of hype about this movie, most of it because of the all-star cast in the film. but a great cast or not this movie falls flat, makes the men who star at goats look like an instant classic!!"
0,Not as pictured . . .,"The button labels on this watch are so small, I simply could not even read them. The picture of the watch on this site must be blown up several times because it led me to believe the labels were clear and visible. Well, they are not. I sent this back."
0,Go Away Van Damme!,"Van Damme needs to stay in Israel and never come back after this movie. Charlton Heston of all people, makes a horrible cameo and I was appalled. I've never been so disgruntled in my life after watching this. Oy Vey! No more. I can't take the pain and suffering, why do I keep renting these Van Damme movies. I guess I'm a nice guy."
1,Einstein Syndrome...Bright Children Who Talk Late,"If you have a child that is late with speech development, seems frustrated with communications, strong willed & defiant, prone to tantrums, good at solving puzzles, loving but sometimes aloof, concentrates on some tasks, ignores requests to perform other tasks, not the least interested in potty training, exhibiting some autistic or PDD tendancies but having exceptional memory and suprising intelligence, then you need to get this book. Don't be put off by reviews of the professionals, the book has some information that will help concerned parents bypass those professional egos and cut to the main issue, how to best understand and help your child."
0,No Power,Tried two of these. The first simply didn't work. The second didn't have enough power to push the dough out. Fresh batteries and their receipe didn't make any difference.
0,Did not work right out of the box!,"The Skylink HA-318 did not work right out of the box. The motion sensors would not communicate with the main control unit. I spent a couple hours setting and resetting it up and finally gave up and returned it back to Amazon for a refund. The appearance and construction is fairly OK except for the wire antenna. It is just one step up from a twist tie that you use to seal your trash bags.Optex RCTD-20U Wireless 2000 Annunciatorwith the companionOPTEX Wireless Sensor Transmitter, 1,000' Rangemight be a better product judging from some reviews. I would like to try this system but waiting to find a lower price."
0,Ugh.,"Bought this at a local market, on sale thankfully, and am fully disappointed. It's bitter and doesn't have great olive flavor, though it is quite a beautiful green color. If you're looking for a mid-premium olive oil I'd recommend Alessi or Lucini way over this product and both are in the same price range."
0,Disappointed,"I just got done reading this book, and I can say it was almost a complete waste time. It was all wining and insecurities. The ending was okay(I've always liked a happy ending), but the book kept draggin on and on... and what did she ever do with Leah's journals. they never explained that, or was I dozing off during that chapter?"
0,Not good!,I only got 3 uses in my 5th wheel before it broke. On my 4th use it had multiple pinhole leaks along what looks like the seam on the inside of the diameter. Too bad because it did coil nicely.
1,Not bad for the price,Good for general purpose use around the house. Can't beat the price for what you are getting in this set.
0,Implausible story with many technical inaccuracies.,"Implausible story with many technical inaccuracies, and with unrealistic characters (even allowing for poetic license). The technological aspects of the book were not authentic. I believe this book had the potential to be excellent. More research, better writing, and better editing would have helped."
0,Please clarify,"We have no record of this item ever being shipped or received. We are, however, interested in this item, and after the issue has been clarified, we shall place an order for it. By the way, the system requires a rating; I am using one star, just to be able to send this message, which is unfair to the shipper. This should be fixed. Thank you."
0,bad quality,"the peeler is so hard to use. You can easily get a $1 product which performs better. It also has bad quality, the top was just sealed with a kind of sponse, and it falls off when I firstly use it.... very disapointed."
0,Constantly troubleshooting,"Once I configured the headset, it worked fine for a day or so. Then no sound. I finally changed batteries and had sound again. Then no sound. I finally realized this headset goes through batteries like Grant took Richmond. In a years time I will have spent as much on new batteries as the original purchase."
1,Greatest Service Ever from Avocent,"I bought this device since it met all my requirements. When I tried to install it, my monitor was not recognized by the switch. I tried a bunch of connections but no luck. I contacted Avocent tech support and spent some real quality time with one of the techs. He instructed me on how to update the firmware. It did not cure the problem so I called back the next day. They said they would issue an RMA. Now this is where it gets really AMAZING. They sent me a new switch in three days, BEFORE I had returned the old one. What great service!!! Also the further good news is the new box works really well. This is just such an unusual level of service and reflects great credit on Avocent and their employees."
0,Much better resources can be found elsewhere,"As noted by other reviews, this book is only half of the story. There is another guide titled: ""The FreeBSD Handbook 3rd Edition, Volume II: Administrator's Guide"" which you will also need to get all of the content available in the 2nd Edition. That said, you would do best to avoid both of these books and look to other sources of documentation. Most information can easily be found online but if you really like printed documentation (as I do), I would recommend a book likeAbsolute FreeBSD, 2nd Edition: The Complete Guide to FreeBSDwhich was just released. The FreeBSD Handbook has a number of typos, the index in back is awful, and the information is out-of-date (it is targeting FreeBSD 5.X)."
0,Broke within 3 months,"Although the brushed aluminum body is very stylish, the product parts are incredibly cheap. The sprayer works by creating air pressure in an internal canister as you pump the cover, which allows you to spray oil as a mist. Unfortunately, the plastic tube, which is supposed to force air into the nozzle, is so flimsy that this product broke almost immediately. It is no longer able to force air into the spray nozzle, so it cannot spray a mist.I would recommend trying a different brand. It may cost a little more, but you get what you pay for."
1,DO NOT ORDER DURING THE SUMMER!!!,"I thoroughly loved these when I had them in London. So, I ordered 48 last winter. (Yay! No Problems.)THEN I ordered 48 at the end of July...(AAAAHHHhhhhhhhh! All squishy!) I stuck them in the freezer, and I hope that saves them. I am skeptical that they will survive.So, I seriously suggest you do not buy these during the summer.(What was I thinking???)"
1,Best tonic ever!,I love this tonic! Been using it for several years. Taking it when you feel a cold coming on will stop it from progressing. Also good for a tonic when feeling run down. Not easy to get in the stores...so I will always order and keep a bottle in the house.
1,Perfect for people who like to debunk things,"This show should be required viewing for americans. Really. They should air this instead of the evening news.I applaud P&T; for this really smart, entertaining show."
0,No plot,The story plot of this movie sucked. It started going on a boat trip it ended going back on the same boat trip. She was in this time still world that she kept re-livin. The question is WHY. The movie did not give a reason. What happened to make her go into this state. It started in the time still state and ended the same way. I will never watch this movie again. I gave it one star because that is lowest grade I can go.
0,poor quality,"this ink is of really poor quality... my printer wont print without a line through the text and it wont print certain colors... green prints yellow, blue prints pink, etc etc... total waste of money... spend the extra money to get a real cartridge..."
1,Perfect,"Good size, heavy. You'll need some felt pads on the bottom if you don't want it to scratch your countertops."
1,Budget expense!,"These earrings are great! They match my expensive Lois Hill ring from a high end store. They are great quality for the cheap price and made of sterling silver. I am very pleased with the look, size 1/4-1/2 inches approx. and quality. If you are thinking about them, go for it! I did and am very pleased."
1,This video is really helping my kids learn to use the potty,"I am potty training my almost-three year-old twins, and this video is a big help. The songs are catchy, and the production is not too ""clinical"" -- kids enjoy watching the story and aren't just bombarded with potty facts. I would have preferred showing use of the bathroom in different situations -- public toilets, other people's homes, etc etc. There is also no disucssion that the child might still have an accident, but overall it's well worth the small price of the video. (end note: you too will be humming tunes such as ""She is a Super Dooper Pooper"" after watching this -- aahhhhhh!!!)"
1,A Must buy!,"I have been a Paul Weller fan from back in the Jam days and have dabbled in other Paul weller material with some enjoyment. I dedcided to add this CD to my collection and I was not disappointed.Although this material is nothing like the Jam, songs like ""confessions 1,2 & 3"" and ""how she threw it all away"" are excellent. The Haunting lyrics of ""it's a very deep sea"" forced me to play this song over and over. This song touhed me very deeply indeed as it touches on our despair over the past and how the past effects us very deeply as we dive lower in negative emotions.Why only four stars? Two weaker songs such as the gardener or eden reduced it's rating for me.Great job Paul!"
0,Check my style out! Put cha tape decks on record!,"Strangely dated and humorless. Without the humor the Beasties come from the land of suck, without the nasty, crazy ass samples and backing tracks I just don't give a sh... Now excuse me I gotta go dig up a bee's house and eat some larva."
0,"Overpriced, software doesn't work, abysmal support","What a disappointment the Iomega Mini line has been. I purchased the 512 to have a larger capacity flash drive, but I expected the Security software to work without troubles. Was I ever wrong! None of the software bundled with this expensive drive works for me. I have four smaller capacity key drives from three (!) other companies - three of these have security software that works without a glitch. The Lexar Secure Jump Drive in particular works seamlessly in Windows XP, Windows 2000 AND Mac OS X, making it hands down superior over this awful Iomega Mini drive for my purposes. Sad to see for a company that I have loved in the past, but support is worse than the drive itself."
0,not enough breeze,"I wasn't satisfied with this fan. I thought the oscillation would be a good plus, but the breeze it produces just isn't strong enough. I returned it and bought the Holmes HACP7W 7-Inch Clip-On Personal Fan which I'm very happy with."
1,Sweet Book,"I read the book Trials of Death by: Darren Shan.It is the 5th book in the Cirque Du Freak serious .I recomend it for someone who likes action .Darren's master has done a bad deed and now Darren has to take on the Trials of Death.He has to take on 17 trials to clear their names.Their are 3 options, he dies in the events, makes it to the next round, or gets executed if he fails.I think this is a sweeeeeeeeeeet book!"
1,Very good book---especially if you know Pittsburgh,"This is a wonderful novel about youth, occupation, andparental relations. And if you think you've got problems,the narrator has to deal with a father in the mob,a girlfriend and a boyfriend, and a weird circle offriends. (It's even better if you've lived in the Oaklandarea of Pittsburgh and can recognize the local landmarks.)Definitely a good piece of literature---don't be fooled bythe title."
1,High quality children's software,"I was VERY impressed by both titles in the Play Time collection, especially Blue's Treasure Hunt. There are countless clickable surprises to discover as you, Steve and Blue range through the game world. (My 3 year-old was utterly delighted to spend half an hour clicking some blocks to stack them up, then clicking a toy car to knock them down.)One of the things I most appreciated about this and other Blue's games was the control and gameplay were designed to be maximally child friendly. The feedback level is effective and appropriate for little attention spans (e.g. if you misclick while trying to match a shape, a little buzz sounds and you're allowed to try again... no long sound or video tracks to wait through).Overall, a fantastic deal on two very high quality software titles."
1,Phobic No More!,"The soothing thing about Lucinda is that she knows the topic of which she speaks, speaks like a normal person, and is devoid of the new age mumbo-jumbo that only causes people to spiral out of control more. This is a program about becoming a grounded person, and it is probably one of the few resources that can help someone self-manage their way out of the cluster of negative patterns contributing to panic and anxiety. If you grew up in an atmosphere of fear, Bassett is especially helpful for her innate understanding, since she herself grew up in an alcholic home. This program has helped many people since 1985 and if time is the true litmus test ... this is an essential toolkit."
1,Fun Movie,"Even though the movie strayed from the book quite a bit in places (which is odd considering Adams helped write it), the movie is fun and worth watching."
1,See all the Desert has to Offer,"From Arizona's gorges, to desert terrain, to streambeds and more...this book has pics and descriptives of them all. If you want to experience Arizona's plant life and varied terrains, then set out on a course of your choice and take along this book to enjoy it to the fullest."
1,An intriguing movie that I could watch over and over,"Lindsay Lohan and Rachel McAdams are splendid together. A incredible story of survival, friendship, and how one person can change the lives of everyone around her. Lindsay Lohan plays student previously from Africa who befriends Rachel McAdams, leader of a clique known as the Plastics. Through her determination and will, Robbins becomes the co-chair of the Student Activities Board and with these new relationships with the teachers and students, she wins over friends and trust. Lohan and McAdams become good friends and confide in each other. ""I'm trying this new thing where I don't talk about people behind their backs."" --Words to live by."
1,Thank you Canada!,"I would like to thank Canada for another talented artist.I was introduced to the music of Luke Doucet when he was filling in for Greg Keelor on the Blue Rodeo American Tour. They allowed him to open with a few songs from his solo album. I was a fan after the first song.Luke is very talented on the guitar and his song writing skills are excellent. He produces a very unique sound. It is blues, rock, and alternative country mixed into one. There is something for everyone. I really love what he does with classic rhythms.I would strongly recommend this album to anyone who enjoys Canadian rock. He is a strong newcomer in the genre.I would also like the John Mayer, Josh Kelly, Jason Moraz fans to check out this album. Luke Doucet is a real musician. If you like the industry produced wannabes, you will be blown away by this guy."
1,Fabulous,"Ever since reading Lionel Shiver's We Need to Talk About Kevin last year, I have been trying to replicate that experience. Karen Novak's Innocence comes the closest yet. Shriver's book (an incredible effort) tells the story of the mother of a Columbine-type school murderer. The intensely troubled relationship between mother and son is at the heart of the book. At the hear of Novak's book is another relationship, this time father and daughter. The relationship is just as intense and troubling as in Shriver's book, but in a slightly different way. It is a long time before we find out how Leslie really feels about her father, that conflict and uncertainty, and the shifting reality as presented in the book, bring together a tragic, but beautiful story of innocence lost."
0,Not for the Allergic: Awful smell.,"This is wasted money. It smells horrible if you're allergic to perfume. It's not ""Lightly scented"" but heavily scented and not ""tear free"". Bad product. Find something completely scent free for your baby."
1,My 7 year old LOVES this costume!,This costume is adorable. My child loves it. He puts it on all the time and it's not even Halloween yet.
0,Not worth the cost,"The vogue, since the late 80s, of attempting to discredit theory by those who have not mastered the tradition, the philosophical background, or the methods finds a somewhat less strident voice here but not one that does the thinking reader a service. Unfortunately, this text is so much less acute and informed than those it tries to encounter that it does them and itself a disservice. If you would like to begin to understand the problems of literature and philosophy, read some of the texts themselves, not this partial and unintentionally parodic rendition."
1,Shadow Divers,"A very interesting book for those interested in Diving, Underwater Salvage and WWII history. Language can get a bit raw at times, but it is expected with this type of environment. In all, I really enjoyed reading it."
0,disappointed,"well - we got this talking watch for my 4 year old son who is constantly asking us what time it is. It is easy to push the button for it to tell them time, but very easily messed up if the other buttons are pushed so that was disappointing because it was then almost never right. Also - we could never figure out how to get it off of military time (a concept which is lost on a 4 yr old) so he never uses it. at least it was only $10!"
0,Not his best effort....,"...and that's what really [bothered me] about this novel. I was [pulled] in by an amusing title concept and having read some of his other work took it on faith that this novel would be as enjoyable as all of his others....WRONG....Since wasting my hard earned $$ on this cookie cutter assembly of short stories, I've learned to read at least the first chapter of a novel instead of just the back cover. Lesson learned..."
0,What a disappointment,"I remember playing Chinese Checkers as a child and loving it. I bought this for my 9-year-old for Christmas. I didn't want to spend a lot of money, just in case he didn't think it was fun. When it said the product dimensions were 12.2 x 12.2, I thought that meant the game board, not the box! I guess I should have known better when it also said it was 1.5"". It also said it was a ""colorful, sturdy game board"" but that's not true. I was so disappointed to find it's a fold-able board which means it does not lay flat! Kind of hard to play with marbles on a surface that isn't flat.I also purchased a Checkers game made by the same company. It's more what I expected. The board is one piece and made of particle board (or something like it).I would not purchase this Chinese Checkers set nor would I recommend it to anyone."
0,Very disappointing,"I decided to try this ""shredded jerky"" because Buffalo Bills country cut jerky is really great and I kinda wanted the cans to put some of my country cut jerky into. Well the cans are rather tiny and the jerky inside is very very salty. It's not really shredded, it's more like dust. Once you start chewing it - after getting over the saltiness, most of it turns into a wad of unchewable fat.Each little can will give you about 5 or 6 pinches of jerky dust, and you will spit out about 65% of that. I will not buy this product again. I will stick to their country cut mild, spicy, or chipotle habanero flavors."
1,Lionel Train Sets a collectors guide,"David Doyle's book is a must have for the collectors library. It is ""THE"" guide to determine what came in which set in the postwar era 1945-69. It covers not only cataloged sets but special and uncataloged sets as well. I wish that it had packaging photos of some of the ultimate sets like the 1964-1966 Hudson Set the Super-O set with 3 operating cars and more."
1,Great,"Jeff Dunham is easily one of the most talented entertainers today. He's funny just telling jokes, and then you almost forget he's alone on stage once the puppets come out. Simply great."
1,I LOVE LOVE TITANIC I COULD DIE I DON'T SEE IT.,LEONARDO YOU ARE SO LUCKY YOU GOT TO BE IN TITANIC O AND YOU TO KATE. Did Kate stayed loving you leonardo cause I do. I LOVE TITANIC BUT NOT MORE THEN YOU LEONARDO
1,GREAT BOOK IF YOU CAN,"I continually recommend this book to friends and family. Three years ago, I learned sleep training takes work - and I can't tell you how many friends ridiculed my strict nap schedule (because I couldn't go to the mall for a baby stroll that day), but it certainly paid off. I have two great sleepers (ages 3 and 2) thanks to this book and have another on the way that I hope does not prove Dr. Weissbluth's methods wrong.For parents who believe sleep is healthy (and not just the baby), I highly recommend this book. We all love our sleep!"
0,getting your feet wet is only the first step,"Any book that proudly uses such over-the-top buzzwords as ""insider guide"" and ""A to Z"" should really pack a lot of punch. It should be filled with useful, lengthy and original material and make the reader feel as if they have really invested their valuable time wisely.Unfortunately, the publisher name ""WetFeet"" speaks volumes about the severe limitations of this empty pamphlet. They are asking way too much money from people who are looking for jobs. They deliver only the bare essentials and hardly anything new or worthwhile.Tons of other books on this subject do a much better job: What Color is Your Parachute? is only one."
0,Major Typeo on cover of Brand New book!!!,"I believe amazon is dealing with this issue, but the book was purchased brand new from amazon. The side cover says ""Ooganic Compunds"". Beyond the cover, the inside of the book seems fine so far."
0,Huh?,"It's obvious that most Neil Young fans are thrilled with him no matter what sort of dreck he comes up with. But speaking as a long-time (since Buffalo Springfield days; I saw the first CSNY concert) fan myself, I have to say that this one just doesn't cut it.I saw Young in concert not long before this album came out, and he performed many of the songs. These versions are poorly performed and sloppily produced. And the album has no real point of view; despite the efforts to portray it as having an anti-drug message, it also contains such pro-drug gems as ""Roll Another Number for the Road.""Young deserves credit for his ambitious musical reach, but this one, which was well within his territory, thoroughly exceeded his graasp."
1,for advanced Sanskirt readers,"Although I can see the frustrating aspects of the 'vocabulary' list approach utilized in this work, I still find great utility in the collection of Sanskrit terms associated with each English lexical entry. Translating Sanskrit often places one in the 'tip-of-my-tongue' situation where you can't find just the term you're looking for. A book such as this provides a Sanskrit thesaurus, if you will, to provide just the needed lexical categories in said situation. I would recommend this book for any serious translator."
1,Exelent Product - Much cheaper from Toshiba Direct,I have been using the expansion pack for several years now. It works exactly as advertised. I have been able to use a USB keyboard and also a mouse using free drivers I found on the internet. You can buy this product much cheaper at www.toshibadirect.com. It is currently selling for $49.00
1,Been a LONG time coming,"Finally they've released the second season of one of the funniest shows ever. I can't wait till season 3 comes out. The commentary is pretty good. They've recorded commentary for every episode, unlike the first season, which is a plus. It can drag at times when they decide to impersonate certain characters (the Tite brothers) but also has many gems (""Bong Boy! Are you really here?""). If you've never seen it, I would sugest starting with season one, but this is a MUST own for any fan. Special guests include: Tina Fey, Horatio Sanz, Rob Corddry, Wu-Tang Clan and David Cross."
1,Half and Half,"Eight great songs, two mediocre (Whipping, Satan's Bed) and four utter pieces of garbage they should be embarrassed to record (Pry, To, Bugs, Aye Davanita and Stupid Mop). Why not just put together 10 or 11 really good songs with no filler? This is still a classic album I guess, but it also marks the beginning of Pearl Jam 's downward spiral."
0,Not A Good Option,"Replaced the first one because it played the same series of songs each time it re-started.Second one says it has 1.8 GB of music loaded but WILL NOT play any thing in last 500MB.Folder shows songs,but when you try to access them it shows ""NO FILES""!NOT A GOOD CHOICE!"
0,disappointing,"While the title of this book appears to be an uplifting story of a poor black man from the Bahamas, it truly is a story of a man who is still carrying a grudge over the racism of the 50's and 60's. He is a wonderful actor and accomplished much in spite of the state of our country during those turbulent times. However, he has made a wonderful living in our capitalistic society and should take pride in our country and his fulfillment of the ""American Dream."" As for taking care of his family (his words to describe the true measure of a man) I was disappointed to learn that he left these beautiful children and their mother for another woman. There's the true measure of some men!"
1,~I LOVED THIS BOOK!!~,"Donna Hill never lets her readers down. 'Indiscretions' has it all, mystery, romance, and a passion to die for. As a successful attorney, Khendra Phillips faces the hardest trial of her career when she is asked to defend the man that she loves, Sean Michaels. Even though Khendra knows in her heart that Sean is innocent of murder, she still can't find it in her heart to trust him after he takes the promotion in the law firm that she was expecting to get. Sean Michaels is also a succesful attorney with a few secrets in his past that come back to haunt him. The one thing that he doesn't keep a secret is his feelings for Khendra. He is determined to do whatever it takes to win her back.This book was too good to put down. Don't think about starting it unless you have time to finish, you will not want to put it down either. The passion alone makes this book a keeper. If you enjoy this, try and find a copy of 'Rooms of the Heart' also by Donna Hill."

0,MADE IN CHINA!!!,"I shouldve looked and returned the set (i had already trown away the box and everything else).look at the stamp on the blade. it says MADE IN CHINA.there is NO WAY, to trace this material back to Germany. obviously, they dont (sure will not) provide an MTR for the material used to make the blade.I assure if it was MADE in china, the material also came from china, which they normally alter / lie about the materials (carbon content, Nickel content, Mg, Mn, etc...).This is now what I had wanted to have/purchase for my kitchen.can I still return them???I will try to contact the vendor."
1,Ana and her beautiful angelic voice.......,"I had no idea that I was buying such a beautiful album the day I picked up JOYAS DE DOS SIGLOS. Ana will break your heart with her beautiful renditions of classic mariachi, corridos and rancheras on this album. I was used to her more contemporary, poppy sound and didn't know how her voice would make the transition to more traditional pieces. Ms. Gabriel has a voice that is best described as rich. That thick, heartbreaking, ""fat"" mariachi voice. It tugs at your soul, penetrates your thoughts and draws you into the music whether you are a native Spanish speaker or can only respond to the universal form of expression through song.Some of my favorite tracks on this album by far are the mariachi love songs. (""Un Viejo Amor,"" ""Hay Unos Ojos"") and the corridos as well (""Pobre Bohemio,"" ""Valentin De La Sierra""). Though, I am a South American/Estadounidense, for the whole duration of the album Ana Gabriel made me feel Mexican! Que vive, Ana!"
0,Waste of Time,This autor needs to be stoped. And we should pray for all of those that have such weak will sand minds as to beleive joan's insanity. She could be one of the false profits.

1,product as advertised,"Video came new in package, as advertised. Love the Civil War and this is the best video I have ever seen about the subject."
1,Great educational toy for kids,"I bought this for my friend's son as his 4-year-ld birthday gift. The whole family totally enjoy it, and they have been ordering more and more larvae since two years ago. we have been sharing the joys of this toy together. Now my son is about to turn 4, and this is def a must-have for him. I also ordered this for all his day care friends who turnd 4 as their birthday gifts, and everyone loves it!"
1,An eye opening book about High Schools in Texas,"Bissinger kept you turning pages, moving from character to character and the impact playing football has on these young kids."
0,Are you kidding?,"It is more than well known that Tolkien, even he said as much, took great inspiration for his stories from Beowulf, the Kalevala, the Poetic Edda, the Volsunga saga and the Hervarar saga, as well as ancient Anglo Saxon sources. There is practically nothing 'Christian influenced' about his stories, rather the inspiration comes from the Pagan past of northern European religions. Even Tolkien himself is known to have said this much. Geez, look it up!I'll never understand why some people cannot comprehend that sometimes a great writer is just a great writer regardless of his personal faith. The man had an extensive knowledge of northern European pagan literature. It is so sad to see that some cannot help but twist another person's writing to attempt to prop up their own version of their own little world, and legitimate scholarship and academia be darned."
1,Great Series,Im addicted. Plan on spending lots of long nights watching. It's like a good book you can't stop watching no matter how badly you want to.
0,Good Deals book,"This book is very elementary. The 'Good Deals' represented here are not more than most informed 'seniors' are already aware of, like National Parks discounts, AARP discounts, AAA discounts, etc. Not worth the money or the effort to read it."
0,Huge dissappointment,"I remember New Yorkers rushing out to bookstores the week Silence was released. Harris with Red Dragon had completely set the standard for this genre, and we weren't let down. Hannibal reads like it was written in the last few months, and Harris has obviously lost it. Bad storytelling and ludicrous ending, such a letdown."
0,Flawed Kindle Edition,"I rather do admit I find the English a bit boring, might I say, my Dear Watson? Perhaps it is the overabundance of words in a sentence to demonstrate intellectual superiority, my dear chap.Okay, enough of that...The Good: 12 good stories introducing Sherlock..for free.The Bad: Table of Contents, symbols, and you can get ALL of the books elsewhere for free."
1,Beautiful jazz that grows with each careful listening,"This is music to savour. I personally enjoy Clark's rolling, blues-soaked style better in this trio setting rather than with horns.There's plenty to unravel here, and its all performed in a spirit of relaxed invention.Music for the head and the heart! And,on a more prosaic note, the alternate takes are not sequenced after each other - a pet hate!"
0,UNLESS YOU ARE CHRISTIAN DONT BUY THIS BOOK!,"i started to read this book and couldn't get very far due to the fact that every other line in the book has the word God or Christ in it. Neither have any influence in my life and found it difficult to find a relationship between them and meditating. From what i read, meditation can only be done via surrendering yourself to God. I personally feel as though that is unnecessary. Caveat emptor."
0,pretty crappy..,"Yah, this thing is a fair challenge to put together and it looks really nice when it's finished but the launches really suck. It never flies straight up. It always flies to one side or another and the glider just tumbles to the ground. If it detaches from the main booster at all. It should be called a tumbler instead of a glider. The fact that the launch stinks like month old milk greatly takes away from all the hard work put into it's construction. I'm ticked off I wasted a portion of my life putting this thing together. It could be that I just don't have the model assembly know how to get this thing flying rite. but I don't believe that this is the case. all and all I think this thing is junk but ever one will see thing differently. you might love it. But as for me.... I Gives it two thumbs way the hell down...."
0,nothing special,"Aight, let me summarize all the lyrics of this album for you in a couple of sentences.1. I am from Compton.2. I love NWA, Nas, Jay-z, Pac, BIG...(the list goes on). That is why I have to drop their names in every song.3. Dr.Dre and 50 are my friends, so, as follows, I will also call their names out on every bar.4. I ride Impalas and like Nike Air Ones.That's it!!!!!! I ain't kidding! Nothing original, no jaw-dropping rhymes to spit, no flava or style! He gets outshined by the beat on every track (hence the 2 stars - for the beats). I regret so much that I bought this crap. I mean, I liked him on Westside story, but that is the only track where he doesn't only rap about the 4 things described above.My only wish is that somewhere there is a cat with an ill lyrical talent and skills like those of Biggie, Nas or Big L, who will blow all these whack cats away from the rap scene for good."
0,people that like this movie want to be unique,"this movie was terrible because the charactors were boring, no one relates to them, and the story line is insane. after the movie was over i turned to my friend and asked her what the big hype was over the movie and she didnt know either. another user compared the movie to THE ROYAL TENNEBAUMS, but i dont see it. the royal tennebaums has a great story line and is tasteful when it comes to being wierd, whereas this movie does not. i couldnt stand this movie and i will never watch it again. i finished in hopes of the mess of events to come together and make sense somehow but it didnt."

1,wide angle,"Fairly decent. Produces pictures with optical blur on the edges if you use zoom. Leaves black semicircle on pictures taken with a flash about 1/5 the way up from the bottom on the picture because the flash isn't tall enough to miss the wide lens. Other than that.. it does capture a few more degrees. If you are going to pick this or the telephoto attachment, get this."
0,"No way to charge it, no extension cord included",Come on! my battery is dead and the only thing include is the DC male-male extension cord.How do I charge it at home without a extension cord ( NOT PROVIDED ) The most expensive Jump Started at Amazon and no way to charge it right out of the box? I feel beyond mad!!!
1,Addictive!,"Refreshing to see a new show like this. When it was first released, I thought how can they stretch a theme about two plastic surgeons into a successful series? Well they have, and each show is both engaging and exciting.Season 1 is worth seeing, but Season 2 is even better! Many people missed Season 1 on TV, so obtaining this DVD box gives you the chance to see how it all started.In Australia, we are viewing the final episodes of Season 2. It is so popular here that the Tv Network is broadcasting it twice a week. Each episode of this latest season is enthralling and hard to switch off. I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a series so much.I was not a fan of Julian McMahon before this show mainly because I remembered the shows he was in here in Australia before moving to LA. However, he is outstanding in Nip/Tuck. He has certainly perfected his art since the old days.Well done!"
0,"King of the ""Samples""","I wonder how far Kanye West would be if sampling music was a crime. This album has a few nice cuts but the album as a whole is pretty dull. The first album had some imagination behind it, this one does not. I'm sorry but I can't take listening to Kanye rapping on every single cut--with his first CD he had enough sense to let guest vocalist have some time to do what he really can't do, and that is actually sing. The lyrics are already getting old ( how many times do we have to hear about ""Jacobs"" jewelers ) and how many times is he rapping about himself (let some air out of that big head of yours).Overall a real disappointment."
1,Iron Fist,"THIS GAME IS AWESOME! This game is packed full of modes,secrets,and characters. I think it is cool how NAMCO created a blockbuster with so many stories and endings. The modes range from a nice game of beach ball to grueling tournaments. The attitude of the characters can range from cutsie school girl to cold souled Bruce Lee types. The characters each have an unorthodox erray of techniques at their disposal. I would also recomend playing the earlier Tekken titles. As I said before this game is AWESOME!"
0,Tired remake,"Simply a paycheck movie. There are some fun moments when they make fun of each others movie signatures like ""I'll be back"" and others which bring a smile to our face. Having Jean Claude or as I call him Jackass Clod essentially ruins the movie. Let's face it, the guy stinks as an actor and seems to be about as stupid as a stump. The first movie was much better and lots more fun."
0,Qual control,I can not believe the poor craftmanship with which this was constructed. Little thought was given to replacing batteries.Flimsy casing material.I returned mine within a day!This reflect poorly on the name of eddie bauer which i have till this moment held in high esteem.
1,"A rollicking, respectful tribute to the Stones","Yes, it sounds like a Stones production, but these unnamed guys have added their own twists to the songs. Very enjoyable, this labor of love. It's hard to imagine how this mystery band could afford this quality production, great chorus on ""You can't always get what you want"" sounds as good as the Stone's production. There are no liner notes in this Canadian release so the band remains a mystery. Highly recommended, as is the Blues Tribute."
1,Sixties classics,Great and all original singers of that era. Play it all the time and if you love the 60s like I do ..Buy this now!!
1,"cool, cause I say so.","I liked the book, and the way they greatly described the dragons.the book kept me in suspense, wondering what would happen next.it was suspensfull alot and the dragons were described exceptionally well, I give it a 5\5 and definately recomend this book for anyone, and everyone to read...."
1,My first attempt pleased even myself!,"I am my own worst critic, but my first attempt produced a lovely little piece of Celtic quilting that I am proud of. There are many great tips scattered throughout the book, including basic machine quilting tips that help take the intimidation factor out of the process.I am now in the process of planning another larger project and can't wait to get started!"
0,Does not appear to be terribly effective in Tucson,"Had the SB002 turned on in my shirt pocket while working outside around dusk. Was bitten twice in about 10-15 minutes--on the arm and on the leg--before going inside. (By the way, Tucson mosquitoes are extremely stealthly--no noise and they are gone by the time you feel the bite.) So far the SB002 has not been protecting me as expected."
0,Huh?,"Looking at this band from a purely musical perspective, I was overwhelmingly disappointed. Hearing their songs repeated endlessly on the radio stirred up as much confusion as I felt back when ""Hit Me Baby One More Time"" flooded the radio. I don't think this band has a great deal of vocal talent, and the melodies they employ only emphasize this. The worst instance of this has to be on ""Ocean Breathes Salty"" when the band sings a capella and instead of being a fun break (like I'm assuming it was intended to be), the vocals sound more off-key than fun. The lyrics are, in general, lacking in creativity. They DO try to be creative, but it usually fails. My advice is to steer clear of this album and try a group with a little more substance (talent)."
1,Delightful workout!,I look forward to doing this when I wake up in the morning. I love the different scenes (especially the beach) throughout the video - very relaxing! It challenges me and I feel so much better when I've completed this workout. Dr. Pelicci is an amazing instructor!
0,Don't even bother...,I bought this item and let me tell you it was a waste of money. I never got to hear the heartbeat only the cars driving on the street. You do get to hear your own stomach and bowels moving but that's not what you're getting it for. It's a piece of junk.
1,Fantastic Card and Customer Support,"BFG Tech has great customer support first of all. I had a broken GForce FX 5900, sent it back to them and they replaced it with a Gforce FX 6800 OC (Overclocked) for free with absolutely no hassles. This company will be the only ones I ever buy a video card through. The card is unbelievable I run all my games at threshold to see how hard I can push the card and it keeps pushing."
1,Are you busy and don't have time to cook good food? Then buy this book.,"This is a truly 30 minute cookbook with wonderful recipes and colored photographs that will guide you, step by step in your preparation. Most of the recipes in the book have cook's tip inserts which are really useful. Unlike most 30 minute cookbooks, this book not only covers vegetarian dishes and salads but has many fish, shellfish and chicken dishes, as well as recipes for soups and deserts. Furthermore, almost all the dishes could be prepared with readily available or everyday ingredients. This is truly a cookbook for today's busy professionals."
0,Eminently Useless Collection of Arts & Crafts Wall & Wallpaper Designs,"The description for this book is quite vague so allow me to clear things up before you waste your money. First there is a series of short but windy chapters dealing with various aspects of design philosophy. Forty pages worth, to be exact. The rest of the book is a series of colour plates - ""Studies in Design"" - that are thoroughly hideous, intended to be used as patterns for wall paper, friezes, borders, ceiling paintings, dado-rails, etc. The author describes them as ""grotesque"" on several occasions and he's right, but not the way he intended. If you've ever looked through a book of wallpaper samples, you've got the idea. You can see one piece of a pattern, but never an application in the whole cloth.Almost nobody needs this book. Unless you're researching Arts & Crafts or Art Deco interior designs, or making reproduction wallpaper for the period, it is useless. Avoid."

1,not a bad set of knives for the money,"I purchased this set as an intended gift recently, and ended up keeping it for our summer place. I am very surprised at the performance of all the knives, they are almost as effective as my very high priced German ones (you know the name). Despite their having been made in China, the handles are still intact and about the only complaint I have is that two of the ""Sabatier"" medalions have fallen off the handles. One cannot find a comparable set of knives in a discount store, and these would make an excellent gift for someone who is just getting started or people who will never purchase a ""good"" knife on their own. They also sharpen well and easily, but not with the sharpener provided. My son, who is a chef, has used them on occasion and although he wasn't as impressed with their performanceand quality as I am, agreed that I got a ""hell of a deal"". You simply can't go wrong with this purchase. i am now ordering another set (as a gift, once again!)."
0,Hard Rockers Gone Soft!,"Once again, a great hard rockin' band has gone soft. I can't understand what happens as rock musicians age, but it seems once they reach a certain age (40-50), they hang up their rockin' sound in favor of bubble gum or as it is termed in the radio industry (adult contemporary). Maybe they think that sound will sell more records. Personally, I still love to ROCK!! Amazingly, groups like the Rolling Stones and Aerosmith have managed to keep rockin' over the years. With the exception of Four Letter Word, X does not even remotely sound like the same band who recorded Hysteria and Adrenalize. I long for the return of the rockers I knew as Def Leppard!"
0,Can you rate less than 1?,"Checked online comparing many models and purchased one two years ago, worked great all winter. Decided to purchase a second last year year, both worked great all winter last year. Unfortunatly this year neither works, despite cleaning and following all instructions. Guess the quality is put into them just enough to last though the warranty period. Junk, dont buy."
1,Superb collection of short stories about southern life.,"After reading this book about family values and interpersonal relationships among a rural southern family I wanted to cry. Ms Hatchett has put into words the feelings and experiences of those people who have grown-up and become parents in the south. Her collection of short stories encompasses all aspects of family life. There is illness, birth, death, and sibling rivalry. The author lives in rural Georgia and was obviously very observant and sensitive during her formative years. Her description of her family is painted with love and emotion and in such detail that the reader feels that they know every intimate detail of her family life. This book IS the life of a southern lady. All southeners and those who want to share the southern experience must read this book."
0,Is that all?,"I love Seinfeld's sense of humor. I loved the TV show. I own all the available DVD's. I'm eager to see him on stage.As for this book, if you've seen the show, you will have heard the jokes. I was hoping that the book would have talked about more about his life. I would have liked to read about his relationship with Mike Costanza, the guy who was to a degree the inspiration for the antics of ""George Costanza"". It would have been nice for Jerry to acknowledge the extent to which Mike Costanza helped Jerry become a success. A good book to read that covers that subject is, ""The Real Seinfeld: As Told by the Real Costanza"" by Mike Costanza and Greg Lawrence. I strongly recommend that book if you want to read about Jerry's rise to fame and glory.Sadly, this book doesn't do more than tell us jokes we've already heard."
1,josh gracin is amazing,"i just bought this album last week and cant believe i took so long to buy it. not a single song i dont like. its got all differant sounds to it, no two songs soung alike. its so much fun to listen to i have listened to it non stop and have spread the word to many of my friends who also love it."
1,"Still Hacking, But Loving It","A terrific book for any golfer, of any ability. While I haven't seen my handicap drop by 15 strokes, I have seen my enjoyment of each round increase dramatically. Rotella's book has helped me put the bad shots behind me, and play a smarter game. Best of all, the lessons are easily transferrable to life off the links. I've got my copy on my bookshelf (ok, on the back of my toilet), right next to Mr. Penick's Little Red Book."
0,Content is Excellent but.....,"The picture quality was very poor. Everything appeared very dark on the instant download version...it was better, but still poor quality on the DVD version. I loved the content though so was willing to watch it all the way through. I recommend you don't buy it, but I do recommend that you check it out for free from the library."
0,"Almost, but not quite...","I've used Dryel for years, and used to be pretty happy with it, as it seemed to do a good job of freshening up my shirts, pants, & even some jackets. However, in the last couple years, it seems to have been rendered impotent. One night out with a lady friend of mine, I kept smelling a funky odor, and wondered what it was, and that it might be her.... Well, as I drove home, I realized the smell was still lingering, and finally realized it was my shirt! The normal ""freshening"" of my clothes failed to occur, and the shirt smelled just as it did after a night of playing sax, in a hot, steamy, Georgia night club! Well, that's obviously not acceptable. I've tried a couple other boxes of them, and I've found this to be the new norm, if something has been worn while in a sweaty environment, forget about any nice smelling results..."
1,They Don't Make Them Like This Anymore,"An amazing blend of drama and spectacle - as only Old-Hollywood can do. Mix together Clark Gable, Jeanette MacDonald and Spencer Tracy, throw in a raucous club, booze, a rousing title song, and a jaw-dropping earthquake sequence of the 1906 disaster that leveled the city - done in 1936 no less - that still awes. The finale is pure corn, and the film a bit too long, but oh, in the end, it's a great tribute to Hollywood golden age."

0,Cheap Looking,"I purchased this for a gift based upon a review of the product in black. Admittedly, I didn't try the product - once I opened the box, the ""chrome"" version looked so cheap! This chrome version is made of plastic, so the chrome is just silvery plastic, not metal or stainless steel. While the product might work, the chrome version looked too cheap for me, so I returned it."

0,WARNING: ONLY READ THIS BOOK IF YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY FORCED TO!,"I'm sorry for having such a negative comment but after reading this book, I thought, ""WHY WOULD ANYONE WANNA READ THIS?"" My mind began wandering off after reading just the 2nd page. I certainly do not believe that this book is for children younger than 12, especially if you have no historical knowledge of the background of this story. I think that adults would enjoy this book much more than a child or a student. I would not recommend this book to anyone.I think that the main reason I did not enjoy this book was the way that Marguerite de Angeli worded or wrote this book, such as the way that she used the terms, 'twill and thee. Who uses those words anymore?-THIS WAS WRITTEN FROM A 12 YEAR OLDS PERSPECTIVE OF THE BOOK."
1,Not just for the deaf,I first started reading from this Bible about 2 years ago and found the interpretation extremely interesting and helpful. I purchased it to help me do a series of Sunday School lessons on Revelations.

1,Unusual war story makes you wonder about the ethics of this mission,"This long but fascinating story of a military officer and a group of prisoners makes you wonder about two things:spoilers..1. Is it right to get a bunch of prisoners to do something very dangerous, as if their lives were totally expendable?2. Is it right to trap the enemy in a shelter and then pour in gasoline and grenades to kill them like fish in a barrel?Great casting and plenty of action will keep you intrigued."

It is possible that I never figured out the proper way to wear these, but having tried every fitting that came with the set, the headphones ranged from worthless to excrutiatingly uncomforatble. Along with the PMX70's also from Sennheiser, these are the only headphones that I have tried that I did not at least find an alternative use for for the ones that proved to be not worth wearing to the gym."
1,splash review,The video was here on time and was in excellent shape and a lot more entertaining than we remembered 20 years ago!!
1,Nick Bollettieri's Stroke Instruction Series: Killer Forehand DVD,This product matched or exceeded my expectation. It clearly shows the right move in details. I have private tennis lessions for many years but I can learn more from the video. The video is better suited to advance players. You can really learn the essential in hitting the ball if you can play slow motion in that part of the video.
1,a good read for mystery and suspense fans,"Had not read any Elizabeth Peters books before and found this one surprisingly good. I am not noramally interested in archaeology, but she made it interesting and had a good story wrapped around the topic. I would read another book by her.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
0,I wasted my money,The tests in this book do not approximate the difficulty of the real test. Practice tests like this do a disservice to students who go into the test thinking they are better prepared for it than they are.
0,Save your money,"Davenport's book is nothing but a poorly re-written military survival manual. The military's versions are available for free download on the Net or printed copies can be had for a few bucks from Amazon or just about any book seller or surplus store. They are better to boot. Other good choices are books by Mors Kochanski, Ray Mears, Cody Lundin, Lofty Wiseman, etc, etc."
1,Great purchase,"I bought this kayak because we were going camping to a small lake in North Adams, MA. My expectations were not really high based on the price however I am a not a kayak expert. To my surprise this boat really exceeded my expectations, we used it all over the weekend by taking the kids for seveal rides. It was easy to inflate, I used the manual Coleman pump, it took us less than 10 minutes to have it ready. Afterwards it was all fun. Easy to drive and very stable. As others reviewers had said, the picture doesnt shows the real lengh of this kayak, it is larger than seen and has very comfortable seats. Without the overhead of transportation and storage as standard hard-plastic kayaks. I would recommend this product for beginners like me by far."
1,MUST read for EVERYONE who believes Cancer CANNOT be healed!,This book series/videos changed my life and I believe that the Gerson's have a true understanding of just what our bodies can do when given the proper nutrition and optimal care! Cancer (and many other illnesses) can be cured and the body can rid itself of these diseases! Thank you Lord for Max and Charlene Gerson and those that carry on their work!
0,The war's over; we lost--get over it,"This sad, little Don Quixote couldn't even get his sad, little book published in the South -- Traveller Press is based in New Jersey. The only comfort is that this nutjob Holland and those of his extremist fringe are an aging, dying breed. What a joke to keep fighting a battle that my ancestors (I'm a seventh-generation Southerner) lost--move on to issues that make a difference to your life now."
1,One of my Favorite Books by Nora Roberts,"This is my second favorite book by Nora Roberts. I love the suspense in this book. I couldn't put ""Carolina Moon"" down."
1,great for joints!,"I was intending to use beta sitosterol for hair growth. read it was supposed to be a powerful dht blocker. Been taking 1 pill a day for a week. Too soon to see if there will be a positive effect on hair but one thing that I noticed almost immediately was that the pain that I have in my knees and elbows from heavy weight training over the years was greatly diminished. I work out 4 or 5 days a week and since i've been taking this product I can actually lift heavier weights without the usual aches in joints. I read up on beta sit. and it is used as an anti inflammatory. For me works MUCH better than glucosamine,chondroitin msm products that I use heavily. Great product and Great price from Swanson!! As with any vitamin, mineral or herbal supplement; do your reading up on product and benefits and side effects before using"

0,Sorely disappointment,"Be aware that this game is not the deductive reasoning, clue game that it used to be. Now it is more about the visual appeal, hidden objects and mini games. This 2001 edition has already been rereleased in 2007 (treasure of knowledge) so if you are trying to get a game similiar to what was offered in the 80's & 90's this is not it. Continue searching."

0,Might be okay if you buy it soon enough,"By the time I actually purchased this, around my eighth month, I was already used to sleeping on my side. The problems I was having of basic discomfort and pain when sleeping were not helped by this product. If I wanted to move at all I had to wrestle with it to move it and I still hurt all the time. I guess by that point nothing would have helped. It might be useful if you buy it very early on, though."
0,"it's ""just"" a soundtrack","If you are used to, and expecting the typical Simpsons cd: with snippets of dialog and song/music, you are going to be disappointed with this!Put it this way.... the ""Spider Pig"" track... does NOT have Homer singing spider pig!None of the Green Day stuff is on the CdOh and the ""bonus content"" is just footage of them creating the soundtrack...which is available via a link that anyone can accessWhat a big diddily disappointment."
1,Jeans,I have worn these jeans for years. I lost weight and it was hard to find my size in stores. Found them on Amazon for a great price and good shipping.
1,Very Good and Very Applicable,"Very good book...everything is well explained. I like the inclusion of real documents shown in figures, which not only enhance the understanding and making it more practical to apply. Also have many interesting old pictures and stories relating to construction which is a nice break for the reading."
1,Toe Straightener,I have a cross-over toe problem. An orthopedic doctor recommended this appliance.This product is the best I have found to keep my toes straight.
0,A very mediocre phone...,"The phone is ok, nothing more. The reception from outside callers is fine, but when I talk, my own voice in the earpiece has significant static--it's pretty annoying!The phone is heavier then I thought it would be (Maybe all 900MHZ phone are, my old cordless was analog) and it's not very comfortable when holding it with your shoulder and no hands.I live in a relatively small apartment and was surprised that when I went to another room (maybe 50 feet away) the calls would cut out! And this is why a bought a 900 mhz digital phone!Finally, a complaint would be the apparent inability to program the numbers into memory alphanumerically. In other words, I have to scan through a list of phone numbers, instead of seeing, ""Mom and Dad"", ""Office"", etc.I probably would have sent it back, but unfortunately, I tossed the box, so I guess I'll live with it."
0,horrible,"I thought this was a nice looking squeege, but it does not work. It doesn't clean up the water and makes a loud noise against the glass. I had to revert back to using my old squeege, which was cheaper and works a million times better."
1,He saved the best for last,"The patriotism was ridiculous and stupid. But the songs! This show was a landslide. Every song was a winner. Even the last one, if you're rock ignorant or don't give a damn. It has a great tune. And is well done. Pity. I think it's the best show Berlin ever wrote, at least it's the best one I ever heard. The singer/actors were adequate, they put the songs across."
0,Things kind of got crazy...,...and the thread of the story seems to just run further away from the original concepts. Wasn't thrilled with the new ideas expressed in it and wouldn't recommend it as a good read.
0,MIU Apple Cutter and Corer,"Good construction, but the cutting portion of cutter is blunt instead of sharpe. More like squashing than cutting/slicing cleanly. Definately not worth the money. Would not purchase again."
0,"Great content, bad disc!","As an American Idol addict, I was loving this DVD. I loved rewatching the performances. It was great for giving me my American Idol fix as I wait for the season premiere in January. But then I got to the season reviews, and the disc crapped out on me. The picture was jumbled, so was the sound. It just wasn't worth it to watch the rest of it like that. And yes, the whole rest of the disc was like that. I bought another disc in hopes that the new one would work, and had the same problem. If you're only buying for the first half of the disc, by all means, buy it. But if you're excited to watch the entire disc, you're going to be disappointed if you end up with a bad disc like I did."
1,Growing up,"I remember how much I loved this sort of sad song as a child, and I couldn't resist the book writer Pete Yarrow helped pen.My oldest leaves for college next week- the sad song is no longer so sad- the endings' bittersweet twist perfectly captured how I feel watching him prepare for his new life."
1,very satiesfied,"Works very well,looks like new also I bought it as a refurbished one,no problems since I bought it.Good Choice!"
1,This has held up well,"I saw this when I was a lot younger and it seemed far-fetched to me then. Now, it seems like something the Teaparty people would love to do if they could get away with it. Unfortunately for them - and fortunately for us - the top brass in the military isn't that insane. Kirk Douglas does a fine job in the lead role, and all the supporting characters are first-rate too. Tightly scripted, the direction is spot on (events move along at a nice, crisp pace), with a happy ending. Burt Lancaster does a bang-up job as the power-hungry rightwing zealot. Oh, how I wish I could look at that fictional character and just laugh. But I can't. It hits too close to home, right now."
1,Amazing Season,"Another great season of Gossip Girl and it was so close to finding out who Gossip Girl really was. I haven't been watching the third season, but I'm more then excited to see how it plays out for all the characters."
1,good when used frequently,"Since there are only 2 foil cutters, this razor works best on short hairs -- maybe one or two days worth of beard/moustache growth. This razor works great when shaving every day or every other day. When hairs are longer and tend to not get in the tiny holes of the foil as easily, this razor lacks a trimming type of cutter between the foils which I had on a previous Panasonic electric razor. Yes, you can use the trimmer on the backside and then resume regular shaving, but that's a 2-step process versus the 1-step I was used to with my previous razor."
1,My Thoughts On This Book,"I really enjoyed reading this book. I would definately recommend it to anyone who is curious about Derek Jeter. It gave out a lot of new and interesting facts about him that I didn't know. Whenever I read a chapter, I thought that the book was so good that I had to keep on reading it.I am 11 and I do not think it was my age level though. It was a little confusing, but very interesting!"
0,"If I could give this a zero, I would","Buttons don't work, inconsistent, extremely difficult to use. I had an old logitech, much simpler. this one deserves the trashcan, your better off walking up to the tv to change channels. horrrible. absolutely horrible. the buttons either don't work or they are sensitive. so if you want to enter channel 32, after your 15th try you might get it. good luck."
0,Fantastic Show...,"...But an absurd DVD. As virtually everyone else has said, the Cartoon Network really needs to put out full seasons. People across all demographics love this show! It is patently ridiculous to sell the show piecemeal. I hope someone in a position to do something about this reads this review!"
1,great sleep aid for 8 year old,"My 8 year-old niece has trouble sleeping, typically due to mind churn - just thinking about all kinds of stuff. This cd is awesome at getting her to relax and fall asleep - works so well in fact that she requests her mom not play it on the week-end nights when she is allowed to stay up late."
1,Inspired me,"tI had no idea what this would be about, but after reading the synopsis, I gave it a try. I LOVED IT. It's not a traditional ""documentary, but that's ok, I get what the motivation is all about. Renew your ""happiness"" aby helping those around you. Simple, straightforward and powerful. Kudos!"
1,"Good on WEB technologies, with some problems","The book is good in that it provides many details of the Java messaging. The author sounds knowledgeble of WEB technologies and shares his knowledge. It is definetely worthy reading, maybe even a must.But with all good parts, it have some shortcomings. The most important idea behind messaging: asynchronous vs synchronous, is discussed inadequately, I would even say complete failure. For example, claim that asynchronous processes are always faster is simply wrong. Also discussion of transactions is far from perfect. In general, it is impossible to discuss asynchronous vs synchronous, as well as transactions, without mentioning threads, because its all about threads. But the author never ever mentioned the word ""tread""; there is an impression that he doesn't understand this subject himself. As the result, important theoretical issues, which are in the core of messaging, are not explained; even worse, the book is confusing on those issues."
0,Red Planet Mars,"I bought this movie and received it quickly, however it doesn't work and I cannot get the thing returned! I've tried but no one will answer my request. there is no way I guess to contact the people at importcds.com I bet they make a lot of money not having to make good on their product. Margo"
0,Buy This Bag Somewhere Else,"With so many ""free shipping,"" even ""free shipping and free returns"" offers out there, don't make the same mistake I did by buying from Luggage Warehouse. Not only does the Luggage Warehouse make the customer pay shipping both ways; they even charge an additional $5 if you're unhappy with the product and want to return it. (To be fair, their $5 restocking fee policy is in the fine print, but I missed it. The ""customer service""--ha--representative just told me I should feel bad for them, not the other way around, because they have to pay fees to sell their merchandise on Amazon and now, thanks to me, they're going to lose money on this purchase.)"
0,Not honourable--A pity,"The quality of ""music"" is simply poor and monotonous. I am embarrassed that my seven year old niece takes pleasure in listening to it. But I guess that's the type of market Hewitt attracts. Perhaps a guest shot on Bananas in Pajamas will give her the right career move."
1,Beauty and Feeling,"This album swings from fairly conventional Nashville country, on ""I Love It When She Lies,"" to the bluesy shuffle of ""Green Eyed Girl,"" to folk rock grandeur on ""No Higher Ground."" And it vacillates through this range with panache and spirit. In a music world where mainstream music sets the expectations way too low, Greg Trooper is a smart, artistically ambitious troubadour. I wish we had more recording artists like him."
0,It's a Jungle Out There,"""Zookeeper"" is a horribly bad comedy about a lovelorn animal caretaker. Certainly animals deserve better than this. Kevin James' bath scene is one of the most horrifying scenes in cinematic series.... it gives the shower scene ofPsycho (Collector's Edition)a run for its money. Kevin James woos Stephanie (Leslie Bibb), despite the fact she's found another boyfriend and seems to have moved on. In order to impress her, he works as a car salesman. Though this movie is set in Boston, there are a few tantalizing glimpses of Bean Town's beauty.... plus, there is a plug for TGI Friday's when Kevin brings a gorilla with him. Rosario Dawson (Rent (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition),Josie and the Pussycats) stars as Kevin's assistant, who has secretly loved him. As if the awfulAsh Wednesdayweren't penitential enough? ""Zookeeper"" is a lame comedy set in a zoo... and the ending has one thinking Kevin ends up with the gorilla as Rosario looks up to him lovingly."
1,Really get to understand yourself with this book,"This book was truly a blessing to me. I am beginning to understand why I behave the way I do. The book helped me to be more conscious of my weaknesses and my strengths. There are 4 temperaments and there are 12 combinations of temperaments. I am a Melancholy/Choleric. Melancholies for example are never satisfied and can overcome this weakness with a life of heartfelt thanksgiving. The strength of Megan Melancholy is her incredible self discipline. In response to this new information, I have been able to exercise self-discipline to be more thankful and grateful. I write 5 things daily for the things I am thankful for. My life has been changing and improving ever since. This is honestly a powerful book."

1,This is what this book is about,"Sarah and Harriet have led parallel lives ever since they went to boarding school together. Now, in their mid-fifties, they are widowed within three months of each other. For Sarah, who has her own business and soon finds an attentive older lover, widowhood is a release from the sterile snare of marriage. But beautiful, flirtatious Harriet feels like nothing more than an unemployed wife, a woman alone in a dangerous world, a woman no man will ever love again. As Sarah and Harriet gradually, painfully, come to terms with each other and with the men they buried, Shelby Hearon gives us a novel that is at once compassionate and wry, sorrowful and deeply warm."
0,Sarah Connor,I don't recomend this CD if you don't like rap. It was a waste of money buying this CD. There is about 2 or 3 songs that are good out of 11.
0,An unfortunate waste of good writing,"I've never read any of Shreve's other books, but have heard good reviews. The Pilot's Wife, however, is little more than an empty box wrapped in fancy paper. Shreve does a remarkable job portraying grief and its aftermath - but the book never moves beyond that. The first one hundred pages are beautifully written, almost moving, but do nothing to advance the plot. When the story finally does get underway, the reader is carried along on a thoroughly predictable, emotionally unsatisfying journey. In fact, the most shocking thing about the book is that it turns out exactly the way you expect it to with an ending that is very depressing, formulaic, and altogether stilted. It's a shame that a writer like Shreve, who clearly knows how to turn a nice phrase, had to write such an empty saga. I wouldn't hold it against her in the future: but I wish I'd chosen one of her other books to start with."
0,Looking for Proof,"This is an interesting and easy read for the intelligent mind. The author promises a lot in the title of ""how little things can make a big difference"" and offers an absorbing theory for this phenomenon. While the author linked his theory of epidemiology with psychology and sociology using compelling stories including Sesame Street, Blue's Clues, and the Fall of New York City Crime it seems this connection though correlation is flawed in that the author was simply looking for events, and interpretations of events, that confirmed his theory. One may also write a book about ""how big things can make a big difference"" or ""how big things make a bigger difference than little things"".As I said, this is a nice read for a Sunday afternoon, but I wouldn't make any ""big"" decisions based on the information in this book."
0,This book is garbage!,"Do not waste your money ! Instead of bying this junk, look for other publishers. A good recommendation would be the Sybex's titles: WOSA I and WOSA II separetely. After failing twice, I bought the Sybex books and passed after a fast read."
0,hated it...so unreal it was laughable,"OMG whoever told this author they had a gift of writing urban lit was a total liar. I hated this book. As a matter of fact, I removed it from my device. I'm a fan of Urban Literature and this was a major dissappointment. If I could give it a half star, I would."

1,Handy guide to becoming a top executive,"As an author and an intellectual, the late Peter F. Drucker was a true business sage. Recognized as the father of modern management, Drucker forecast numerous pivotal trends, including decentralization, privatization and the development of the information society. He introduced the concept of the ""knowledge worker,"" a term he employs widely in this fascinating book. His internal study of General Motors, Concept of the Corporation, greatly influenced how businesses conduct their affairs. Each Drucker book is a genuine business classic, including this one. getAbstract believes it will help you think productively about what you do. No one writes more intelligently or presciently on management and its functions than Drucker. All executives, even those who are already effective, will benefit from reading this informative, enlightening book."
0,Thank goodness I only rented it,"This is just a bunch of movie clips of Jackie Chan (mostly from ""Young Master"" and ""Twin Dragons""), and then some of Bruce Lee. There really isn't any biographical information, or anything on either star. (They could have at least shown the scene from Fist of Fury where Lee snaps young stunt-man Chan's neck!) The only, only reason to even rent this is for the interview of Bruce Lee at the very end, which was pretty interesting."
1,"An Affordable, Solid Watch With One Drawback","This watch is affordable and has a long battery life. It has good features, a nice display and is easy to use and set the time for - in either 12 or 24 hour time. It also has a stop watch function and can display two times, so you can switch between time zones if you want (or between normal and daylight savings time). This Timex is generally reliable and durable......except for the band, which is made of metal and really fragile rubber bits that have the unfortunate tendency to dry up and crack apart, leaving your watch unable to interface successfully with your wrist. Mine actually broke after about two months - I went and bought another band for this and now it serves me perfectly. My recommendation if you want a good solid watch is to buy this and get a cheap nylon cloth band along with it for when the original inevitably breaks."

1,Among the best in years,"An obscure historical incident provides the occasion for this insightful literary work. It does more than transport to another time and culture, or put you in proximity with strong personalities; it forces you to look at a philosophical or ethical issue straight in the face. The rudiments of this novel are flawless; more importantly it reaches for a thematic ambiguity that can just barely be articulated. Except in a literary work of this quality."

1,Tricky to pour when full,"The decanter is tricky to pour when its full. So when its full with 12 cups of coffee you need to pour it slow and expect it to dribble on a table or counter. This is a small issue, compared to the money you save by making your own coffee instead of buying any coffee at a store, cafe etc.Also, if you are a regular coffee drinker and plan to rely only on this coffee maker for coffee ... buy a backup decanter and store it away. It doesn't take much to crack or break the decanter."

0,Just not good enough for a beginner,"The first couple of chapters are quite good, but then the author looses the plot in chapter three(Classes and Objects) where he seems to forget that he is supposed to be helping beginners to learn. The examples are vague and the explanations sketchy in an area that is key to this particular language. This chapter deserved much more in the way of elaboration on each of its sections, and concludes by expecting the hapless beginner to be able to jump from small code segments to a complete calculator application, using only a code outline for guidance. At this point, I just skimmed the remainder of the book, taking a couple of pointers here and there, but in the main this book is not focused enough for the experienced programmer, and jumps too quickly into heavy code for the beginner."

0,Please do not waste your money.,The e-book download is a 4 page document that has nothing whatsoever that is useful for the present time.

1,I use it to teach French to my private students,"I've used it to teach French in a French bank. Now I use it to teach my private students. It's fast moving for beginners so I would use it more for advanced beginners or false beginners. It's a whole system of books, workbook, and CDs. I like that the workbook, the student needs to do a little thinking and is not written like American manuals where the student can go on automatic and just fill the blanks. It has exercises on grammar, spelling, writing and making up little conversations. My students have fun with the conversations. For older students and adults."
1,Misses a star for the missing tracks,"5ive is my favorite boyband. Excuse me, *lad* band. I love the fact that they don't sound like most of the other guys out there and they know how to rock every now and then. Too bad the US audience seems to ignore them completely. This CD is pretty good but I've only given it 4 stars because it is missing 4 tracks that are on every other release. It is missing my favorite song, ""Cold Sweat"" and anyone who's heard it can testify to how great it is. My friends and I couldn't stop singing it when we first heard it. If you want 5ive's debut album, try to get an import version. Trust me on this one."

1,Candyland - not like the original version,"Since my children grew up playing Candyland, I was excited to purchase it again as a gift for my two little great nieces. However, I was disappointed when I opened the box to find that the design had been changed. The colored squares were much smaller, and consequently, the ""trail"" was narrower. The girls had trouble following the trail and would jump forward and backwards and sideways. I think the original version was easier. Still, its a wonderful first game, and I'm glad I purchased it."
1,Fantastico,"If anybody who's into rock music is ever looking for a band to keep you on your toes, this is the band.

I can usually fit my laptop, drink and remote control here. Seems pretty stable as well. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it looks a bit cheaper than I expected. You can definitely tell the top is painted plastic."
1,A Fun Read,"""New Spring"" reminds me of why I started loving the Wheel of Time series back when I first made my way through ""The Eye of the World."" This is a fun, quick read, with plenty of action and a nice, quick plotline. It is, in short, a refreshing change after the glacial progress of the last few Wheel of Time books. While certainly exciting for devoted fans of the series, this prequel still is accessible to newcomers. Its plot is self-contained, and while it certainly gives old fans new insights on characters from the main series, no knowledge is prerequisite to enjoyment or understanding of this book. Don't hate this book without trying it because of Jordan's recent less-than-stellar works: that's ridiculous. Look on this as what it probably is--a fun novel that Jordan has written while he recreates the life and vitality that he will hopefully infuse into the remainder of the Wheel of Time."

0,BIG HUGE **WARNING** about Brother laser printers.,"You have to replace the drum unit every 3-4 toners! They told me this at Brother after I bought my printer and it started splotching after the 4th toner. The drum unit usually costs $200 (1/3 the cost of the machine itself). I did the math (price of ink jet printer and cartridges compared to price of Brother laser printer, toner and drum unit, even if you buy the drum unit at Amazon for $127, over the coarse of a year)- IT IS CHEAPER OVERALL TO BUY AN INK JET PRINTER (the conventional wisdom is that it is cheaper per page to buy a laser printer) and at least with an ink jet you get color!"

The people responsible for making this movie are losers, people who contribute nothing to society except to make this world a worse place to live. I find it disgusting that movies like this exist, and that there are people entertained by movies like this. This isn't meant to be a joke or to be facetious - if you like this movie, do the world a favor and kill yourself. I am absolutely not kidding about that. This is a movie made by psychopaths - for psychopaths, and if you like this movie - there's no room in the world for loser scum like you."
1,Very Helpful,This book has been very helpful in coming up with treatment plans for the variety of issues that walk through my door. I don't have the companion of the homework but I think that might be helpful as well.
0,We've waited four long years for this?,"Although I want to like it, I can't help but being deceived by this release. I considered Marisa as one of the most promising Brazilian singers, as all her previous albums were very creative and original, but here she falls in the anodyne mainstream pop/rock trend, with sugary ballads and dummy rock numbers. Besides, the extremely overelaborated arrangements interfere to much in her vocals. In fact, just three of the tracks are appealing to me: ""Para ver as meninas"", a melancholic samba, ""Perdo voc"", a Carlinhos Brown song composed especially for this album which is the only really fresh, creative track, and the Marisa Monte composition ""Abolol"", fortunately only accompanied by piano. In average, an avoidable album. If you don't have her previous releases, buy those ones, since they are much better. And let's hope this album is just an anomaly in her career which won't happen again."
0,extreme poor quality product!,"I decided to buy this product for my new born baby due to relatively good review summary. However, it disappointed me completely. First of all, I received one with broken frame in intact box. After replacement request, I got a second one with a crack on the edge glass face. Then I found no more replacement available on Amazon. Due to the tight timeline for need of such product and tired of online search, I try to use it anyway. It turned out that the rolling pin is really a piece of junk. Quite a lot of material was stick to it if you use the rolling pin included. What a waste of that poor suffieient amount of material. The cutting ruler did not work well since the material stick to it too, better to use your own knife.Overall, it is waste money to buy this junk."
1,Attain NIRVANA,"From the first couple of seconds of ""Serve the Servants"" you can tell this album is not the radio-friendly, unit-shifting piece that Nevermind was. In interviews with the band about the release of this album, you can see Kurt almost gleefully proclaiming how this album will make Nirvana lose some of their cheerleader-jock Nevermind fan base. So, if you want poppy melodies mixed with noise (almost White Light/White Heat level) this is for you. I think most Nirvana fans think that this is the greatest Nirvana album. ""Scentless Apprentice"" is what I think of when I think of Nirvana. ""Heart-Shaped Box"" is pop enough, but also beautiful. ""Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle"" ""Dumb"" and ""Pennyroyal Tea"" are all favorites, and ""Radio-Friendly Unit Shifter"" will annoy most anyone much to your pleasure. ""All Apologies"" is one of the Greatest Nirvana songs written, one of the greatest songs ever. Even Sinead O'connor can't screw it up. Just get it!"
1,Not Stay Down.....get up!,"I was introduced to Two Lone Swordsmen a while back with their Stay Down release. I was impressed to say the least. With their new effort Tiny Reminders, they all but abandon the underwater sound of Stay Down but retain the dub element in some of their tracks. Collectively I would have to say that this is the most refreshing electronica I have heard in a long time. (and I listen to alot of electronica) This cd is not really ""dancey"" but definately alot closer to dance than Stay Down. Makes you wanna shake your ass...but not your whole body. If I had to compare this cd to something I would say a cross between Mu-ziq and Plaid (Both on their better days). But if you are looking for a unique infectious sound, this cd is definately for you. Fans of Wagon Christ, Jega, and Plaid should put this on your ""to buy"" list."
1,Zombie Killers United,"As the author ofJulie Rayzor ~ Romance, Adventure, ZombiesI found this work to be an inspiration and a guide for not only surviving a zombie apocalypse, but surviving during any state of emergency. The writing is succient, fast paced, and exciting. He delivers the facts that you need to survive and offers suggestions on improvizing in the heat of battle. What a great book!"
0,Absolutely worthless and a major headache,"All summed up in one word is easy to do on this one: BAD!!!! It has great and easy software, but is a headache. The hardware is bottom-of-the-line misfit junk, and screws up the computer very very badly. One time, one of my computers was having a hard time starting the hardware. I ended the task and shut down, and when it was started again, it only started in safe mode, never to work again!! I ended up uninstalling every last driver and software and reinstalling it to get the computer working again. the warranty had expired, so the thing got thrown in the garbage. I hope a compactor has flattened this peice of garbage. HP has absolutely no reliability. We tried an internal one of their burners before this, and were able to return it. the internal screws the system up just as bad as this one. DO NOT buy HP products. The only thing that they are even remotely good at making is printers."
1,Not as good as the original,"When I saw this in theaters the weekend it opened, I was expecting to see a movie that was much better than the first. I was wrong. Now don't get me wrong, the movie does have some good parts. 4 people sign up for a tour of the Black Hills area, also known as Burkitsville. They camp out at Rustin Parr's house, the same house where the 7 children were murdered. They wake up the next day with 5 hours stolen from them, and their stuff all trashed. They go back to Jeff's house to try and piece together what happened. But the terror doesn't end there. As strange markings apear on their bodies, phantasmic visions bombard their eyes, and their sanity slowly drifts away, they soon realize that when they left the woods, the didn't leave alone..."

0,"Not good. Swine was written for Jon Corabi, not Vince Neil","The album before that had Corabi was the bomb. I wish I had heard Jon on Swine but he was let go and Vince (who is THE lead singer of the Crue)was brought back in. In a nutshell, Swine has one decent track imo and that is Afraid."

0,HUGE ERROR,"Cleopatra was of the Ptolemaic dynasty, therefore she was of Greek descent. The family was in-bred, brother wed sister. She was Greek, certainly not Egyptian (black)."
0,A Great Idea but zero support,"A wonderful idea, and when it works it is really neat. But I had a heck of a time setting it up, had to throw out a perfectly good digital phone (it won't work with a digital phone anywhere in the house, Uiden and Vtech are hybrid digital, beware) and it took forever to get it to connect to the local phone line.Support is non-existent, I've sent three e-mails and never a response. Phone call (not an 800 number) take over a 1/2 hour to answer and you will be as knowledgeable as the tech support goof they connect you with. Frustrating.I love the idea, but they mislead you on the cost of the contract, which is way too expensive for the lousy service.It was a gift that has so far cost me $220 ($100 phone and $120 subscription service).Again, a great idea and a real pleasure while it works. But don't buy one for your parents or grandparents. When mine craps out that will be the end of it, I've never been this fed up with a company as I am with Ceiva."
0,Worst movie Eastwood ever made,"This movie is so bad that even the Army, which supported it at first, withdrew there support. Eastwood's character started his career in the US Army during the Korean War where he fought in a battle later called ""Heartbreak Ridge"". The story line was so inept and the telling of the tale so bad that the Army withdrew its support in the production. The film company then had to rewrite to scipt so that Eastwood's character changes services and enlist in the USMC after the Korean War and fights in the Vietnam War.So all of you ""Leathernecks"" looking for a ""pride of the Corps"" tale should pass, it isn't going to happen in this story. In fact, the movie takes pains to present the USMC in a very negative light. That the Corps continued to support this production reflects just how desperate it was for any mention from Hollywood.The script is pathetic, the production weak, and the conclusion unsupportable. Send Hollywood a message and do not support this movie."
1,nice set,"Good set, good price. Only downside is that the holder isn't great, but it does keep them together."
1,Love this stove!,"I ordered this stove for my bedroom. I'm trying to create a sanctuary (since my daughter moved home with my grandson!). It's the perfect size and I love the fact that you can just watch the flames without the heat.(I live in South Texas) It will heat the room when we need it and I was surprised at the amount of heat it generated, perfectly adequate for my bedroom.I like the fact that the outside doesn't heat up and is safe for little ones. Certainly helps create the atmosphere I was looking for and will be all the heat we need.Jane"
0,Not much more than a formula book,"I am an industry professional who bought this book to be a small, handy pocket reference, and I am pretty disappointed with what it contains for the price. It's basically just a small formula book with very little explanation for each section. The pages are literally not large enough for anything meaningful to fit on them, and the text is often times far too specific to one application. I would recommend this book if it cost $5, but for $50, you can do much, much better."

1,Very warm and durable sweatshirt.,"Coming from a place where winters are pretty harsh I wanted something that was heavy and warm. This sweatshirt is super comfortable and warm. I have several of this style and wear them quite frequently around the house, etc. They have stood up to a lot of wear and tear, gone through the wash many times and are still holding up. Love them!The seller, South Horizon, is a very good seller to buy from. They are extremely reliable. I have made several purchases from them and have been compeltely satisfied with how they conduct business. I would highly recommend buying from them."
0,Quick delivery but product is defective,"Ordered these items for trick or treat, which is tomorrow. The package arrived quickly so it has been resting on my dining room table for a week or so, but in opening the package just now, several of the chocolate bars seemed misshaped. Upon opening one, it is obvious these bars were heated up and melted. Not even sure if I can hand them out. What a disappointment."
1,As good as pulling a rabbit out of your hat.,It's really great to have entire shows including the little vignettes leading to the commercials. The only negative is that the original theme music has been replaced by a later theme (at least that's what I seem to be remembering).
0,It didn't work,"We tried it with our cat, and it might be because the first hole or two were too big, but he refused to use it. He used it before we cut the hole, but refused to use it after we cut the first hole. On top of that, the hole we cut was only half the size of the first hole they have marked on the plastic and it still didn't work. The plastic itself is very flimsey. This item is completely overpriced as all you get is a sheet of plastic molded to the toilet. It shouldn't cost more than $10, $15 at the most. Not what it is currently priced at."

0,Reads like a child's book,"I'm a big fan of Austin, but this book is really lame. He literally talks about the 3 biggest Wrestlemania's of his career in about 4 pages. It's like 'yeah, Stone Cold got huge', and that's it. No insight from him on how it felt to be the most popular athelete alive for a time.He also repeats himself over and over about his love for his children, parents, how he only has a handful of friends, blah blah blah.Very uninteresting read."
0,This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things,"I went into this movie with neutral expectations. I hate his music but I thought the movie might be superior. I was wrong.As soon as the movie started, my eyes started to burn. At first I thought it was eye strain, but I then realized the sheer awfulness of this movie scalded my retinas. True story.After an hour of horrible music and fan girls screaming, my ears then started to bleed, but not in a cool way like at heavy metal concerts. Like a heavy metal concert, however, I started a moshpit and personally took on 50 Bieber fans. After awhile my ear drums had enough, jumped out of my ears, flipped me off, and swaggered out. At first I thought this was bad, but I realized that now I wouldn't have to listen to his music anymore and I considered myself blessed.One star for the moshpit I got to start, but due to my lack of ear drums and destroyed retinas, I must take off 4 stars."
0,"Good popcorn, poorly made especially for cost","Purchased last christmas, used maybe 10 times before it broke. The tabs that heat the base were defective, cuisinart sent a replacement but it cost $20, more than this was worth. Save your money and buy a West Bend for less than half the price."
0,"We're joking, right?","All of these 4 and 5 star reviews... are they a joke? I saw someone make a comment that said they had never seen more impressive acting in any film. They clearly have just seen this one, right? This one and maybe Gigli?Absentia was the biggest waste of time I've ever sat down and watched. Thank God I just downloaded it on Netflix and didn't pay for it. But I still would like my 90 minutes back.Anybody who is giving this a glowing review clearly either had a friend in it or helped make it, because I've had friends make better films when they were in high school. How this stupid plot, poorly acted, 2-note soundtrack (seriously... the soundtrack has a total of two sustained notes and one rhythm in it for the entire movie), terribly filmed piece of junk has convinced anyone that it's worth their money is a miracle. Is Jesus coming back?"
1,Very good DVD on George Washington,"Paladin scores again with the final installment in its trilogy on George Washington! (see my reviews of _ George Washington's First War: The Battles for Fort Duquesne_ and _When the Forest Ran Red_) This installment shows us GW's life from the end of the French and Indian War to the Revolution. The coverage is quite deep and not not superficial in the least. However, since it covers the interwar years, we don't get as much 'shoot em up' battles scenes that we got in the first two installments. Nevertheless, this DVD examines how GW grew during those years, what forces played on him to become a revolutionary, and how he influenced those around him. This is perhaps the most important chapter leading up to his break with the Mother Country. You won't want to miss this important, in-depth DVD on George Washington.To continue the saga, you might want to watch _The History Channel Presents Washington the Warrior_, which covers GW's time as general in the Revolution."
0,fulYmpus,"I want to bring up an issue here regarding the fact that this camera probably only accepts xD memory, which by the way is twice the price of common formats. As if there were not already enough memory formats, yet another one. It seems to be about either desperate, or greedy companies trying to capture customers into their markets forever. Why can't we just have one or two formats of memory?? This is as bad as it would be to have 5+ formats of CD-RoM drives. And SONY is even more guilty than fuji/olympus.Smartmedia was developed by Toshiba/Fuji/Olympus, and now Fuji/Olympus couldn't get along with Toshiba/Panasonic for the sD card. Memeory cards will become more and more versatile into the future and soon be used in countless devices. We need to standardize the market. We can't afford to buy special memory for each and every device. If you buy Fuji/0lympus, I sincerely suggest you buy a camera that is not limited to xD. Together the people can control the market for our own good.."
1,A CLASSIC,"I remember first seeing The Prisoner in the late 1970s on PBS.It was amazing. There might be a couple of weak episodes here (towards the end) but the others are great. I use many of the phrases and gestures seen in the show-""Be seeing you"", ""You know what you are - a fool, an idiot."" etc.What I find eerie about the show is how many of the ways the Village watched Patrick McGoohan are now in place."
0,Trace,Not worth reading. Weak story line with incomplete ending. One is a higher rating than this book deserves. Cornwell books just don't have the substance they once had in her earlier writings.
1,Error in product description,"It's great in every way. However, if you'd prefer a digital tuner (as I do), then you might need to look further. The product description boasts a digital AM/FM tuner, but it's disappointingly an analog AM/FM tuner.Overall - especially for the price - I think it's pretty good."
0,Junk--Buy something else,"Purchased about 9 months ago, and one of my print heads just failed. A replacement is $80 so I'm going to look elsewhere--this printer has taken years off my life it is such a failed engineering design experiment!

Consistently scans ""crooked"" when fed in the document feeder; occasionally misses pages. THIS PRINTER IS A PROBLEM. PLEASE BUY SOMETHING ELSE AND SAVE YOURSELF THE HASSLE."
0,Not really...,"My 22 month old absolutely adores the Wiggles, and is mesmerized by most of their shows...except this one...there is a lot of singing and dancing, but it moves at a much slower pace than some of their others. For my toddler, it's the colorful, fast-paced, upbeat shows that he prefers, not the ones showing them sitting around a Christmas tree singing mellow songs, with the children swaying their heads to the beat. Also, my son is not impressed with children in costumes dancing on stage....he only wants to see THE WIGGLES dancing around and singing!! While I really do appreciate the multicultural, and especially the CHRISTIAN emphasis of this show, he does not!"
0,Rip off,"Typical -you pay extra for an expensive humidifier thinking the quality will justify the extra money. It doesn't. The ""maintenance free unit"" (just a glorified filter) lasts less than a season, even using it only a few hours at night. And the part costs as much as a whole cheap (but equally effective) humidifier with a conventional filter. So much for German quality!"

1,Fantastic. The best.,"We've had our Weber Q for two years now. Used it two or three times a week, four seasons a year, even in snow, rain and high winds! I was so impressed with the little grill that I shipped it to New Zealand when we moved here. You can cook anything on it: chops, steak, vegetables, roast beef, roast lamb and whole chicken and do a great job. It wouldn't fit a big chicken or turkey though. It's small enough to be really portable but big enough to cook for four. We've had a few minor problems with it. The holes in the gas ring periodically block off and need cleaning, and the ignition became intermittent after a while. Overall, it's a great design and well made, not like some of the junk available. I recommend getting a gas hose and proper propane bottle. Don't use the odd sized disposable cannisters if you can help it. The portable stand is a must. To top it off, get the rain cover which was pretty cheap.5+ stars for all the fabulous meals that it has cooked us."
1,Great carrier!,"I bought this carrier for my 12 lb cat, and it is huge. That's a good thing though, he is able to stand and lay down comfortably, and the plush bottom is easy to remove and clean. At first I was concerned that the mesh wouldn't hold up if he clawed it, but it appears to be very durable, and he didn't do any damage when he scratched. I like all the little storage spots attached, I can easily fit his water/food bowls, and food. He likes the open airy design because he can see around him and that keeps him calm.The only reason I didn't give five stars is the fact that there is only a shoulder strap for carrying it around. It's a big and slightly bulky, so it would have been nice if there had been two straps to carry it in one hand."
1,Arrietty,"The Secret World of Arrietty was yet another Studio Ghibli success; the characters were full of life (besides the human boy, but we can't blame him for that), and the animation was beautiful, as always."
0,Simply weak!,"Candy is simply a tame attempt to stay relevant since good alt rock was fading quickly. The producer took the edge off the guitars which results in a weak collection of songs. There are a few bright spots, however. Creatures of habit, the best track contains a great swirling melody similar to the beatles. Lies of Hate has a great riff which recalls led zeppelin and a thick melody. No time for waiting is simply a nice, catchy pop song. Blood into a wine is a nice low key ballad with a faint harmonica and mandolins. There's not much else worth mentioning here cause the rest of the songs are simply not memorable."
0,satifaction,This item wAs shiped with out all of the hardware. Very dissatisfied. Does not fit the truck very good and it is mounted to high on the truck. will not buy anything from this company again.
0,Disappointing Sequel to Red Dragon & Silence of the Lambs,"Extremely disappointing sequel to Red Dragon & Silence of the Lambs. Fans of those books will, at first, be drawn into the world of Hannibal, but to paraphrase Stephen King, Harris has simply gone for the GROSS-OUT, when TERROR & HORROR were what his fans were looking for. As for the preposterous ending, it is NOT worthy of discussion. I have NOT been so disappointed with an ending since Anne Rice's The Mummy (actually The Mummy has NO ending). As for a movie sequel, I'd say the chances of Jody Foster appearing in this, unedited (perhaps a screenwriter can come up with a believable conclusion), FAT CHANCE.Save your time & money."

0,"4 parts cheesy organ, 1 part Astrud's lovely voice","I disagree with the positive reviewers completely. I am a casual Astrud listener who unfortunately bought based on their reviews, and was let down. I just wanted Astrud's lovely voice with simple accompaniment. What I got was an organ drowning out her voice. I have since bought the Silver Collection, which I think will suit better most people wanting a casual listening experience where the emphasis is truly on her lovely, simple voice."

Does not come with an AC adapter, and you can't order one. I have been trying to get my money back for a while, but doubt I will see it. I will probably get stuck with a product I will have to throw away. We needed a large display product. Thought we had one. BIG MISTAKE!"
0,little too much going on here,I wasnt overly impressed with this book and thought it could have been simpler in the different cities that the alchemist visited. I found myself skimming thru at some points.
0,"Interesting, but impractical.","Buy this book if you are a jaded knitter and need the inspiration to take your craft to strange places where few knitters have gone before. Think Jan Messant - she of the atfully knitted vegetables (interesting, but who needs them) - only ten times so.For the rest of us, this one is interesting but impractical. You would never make any of the designs but it's still interesting to look and ponder at them. Think of it as a book on knitting theory, or a book of upscale gourmet recipes with beautiful pictures, rather than the recipe book that you love and use everyday."
0,Extremely boring and dull!!!,"I was excited to try this but once I did, I realized that I wasted my money. This is so boring!!!! And the backgroung music is uninspiring. She also keeps on talking, talking, talking......I strongly recommend this for elderly folk, say 70 and over."
0,"A collection of stories, some of them factually inaccurate and self serving","This is not really a book but a collection of stories, which I missed before ordering... This could be alright, but they are told by people who have a vested interest in the revisionist history of Apple. Unfortunately they never really come together to tell a story, and what they do tell is obviously one side of the story and misses much of the historical importance of what was going on at Apple and other companies at the time. The book also contains some inaccurate information talking about things being invented at Apple that really were developed at other companies earlier or at the same time. The best part of the book is the great art work, pictures, and design artifacts shown throughout the book. I'm sure this will appeal to some people but it really missed the mark for me, I was hoping for a complete story of what was going on inside of a Apple."
0,The title says all you need to know -,"- do not waste your time on this book.Just get a good sized European map (circa 1939 population density map will be the best but anything else will be good enough), find Brest in France and then Volgograd(Stalingrad) and Grozny in Russia(USSR).If military advance to Brest in the West and to Stalingrad and Grozny in the East was not enough to win this war, no advice from an armchair general will make it winnable."
0,Strictly for a Java Man-Child,"If you're a java man-child with ADD, looking to read a pretty cartoon book with plenty of personified design patterns, this book is for you!Seriously, this book gives me a headache. At the end of one of the first chapters, there is a stupid crossword puzzle with buzz words from the chapter. If you really hate the usual programming book, and need this sort of thing to stay interested, this book is definitely for you, but if you are that sort of person, I also wouldn't recommend programming.To it's credit, it does have a lot of detailed design patterns, but there was no way I could sit through reading this. If you just did ""Hello World"" in java, then you might use this to kick-start your programming, but I could not see anyone else reading this."

1,Conifer book,"This book is a gorgeous, mouth-watering treatise on gardening with conifers.

It makes you want to begin your gardens all over again using nothing but conifers!"
1,Perfect Background Music for a Bachelor's Pad,"While ""Night Lights"" would be perfect for a romantic evening, it also stands up well to serious examination. The original Philips vinyl LP is fairly rare now, but was one of my most valued jazz albums. It sure is nice that the jazz catalog CD re-issue wave is including this beautiful work of art. Bobby Brookmeyer on valve trombone, Jim Hall on guitar, Art Farmer on trumpet and of course Gerry Mullgan on baritone sax are at the top of their form in this early 1960's small big band date. This was recorded shortly after the Concert Jazz Band period for Mulligan and further testifies to his abilities as a top-notch arranger. You might also check out these earlier big band recordings on Verve - Gerry Mulligan and The Concert Jazz Band ""Live At The Village Vanguard"" is the one most accessible currently, although there are others to be found on CD."

0,For Kids only,"I thought this DVD would help me with american sign language as I am a beginner. I felt like a child as I watched the illustrations. I couldn't quite understand the zoo stuff. It did teach some words but not enough, way to much focus on the field trips."
1,Good for those far away shots,Takes excellent pictures at long distance with very little distortion and good clarity. I rate 4 stars instead of 5 since this lens is heavy and puts a lot of stress on the camera's own lens assembly.
0,So Bad its Funny,"I first saw this on the SciFi channel. My family and I love monster movies. This can't be considered a horror movie or it would get no stars. It appears they filmed this movie over a long weekend in the Canadian mountains.The plot is as typical and highly predicable, but it is fun to wager on who will be the Yeti's next meal. The special effects are abysmal and consistant mostly of a large man in a latex and white fur ape suit. There is some very low end CGI which appears to have been added as an after thought.The best scene involves Peter DeLouise being tackled by a Yeti and then beaten with his own leg before the Yeti takes a bite of it.It's a sad sad attempt at a horror movie but funnier then most bad horror movies. This is a prime candidate for Mystery Science Theater 3000."
1,Great Ivana,I can't go anywhere without this book....If you're really serious about being an actor you should get familiar with the Chubbuck technique...it has changed me as an actor and a as person...it empowers you! It gives you all you need to live a role.
1,See what Love looks like.,"I first read this when I was going through a vegetarian phase. My mother had it. I bought my own copy because of Laurel. The scene where she packs the lunch; she just shows you what Love can look like. Simple, humble doing what is right for another person. Her care of her craft is not to be showy or make herself feel good, it is about the benefit of her family and neighbors.I tried several of the recipies, very good but for me it is really about Laurel. It may be time to read it again."
0,Droning on and on,"The author drones on and on. He belabors every set of ""facts"" he uses to attack the fast food industry. I worked at a fast food restaurant as a teenager. Yes, it was mindless work. But we had fun and made the most of it. We were well managed and always treated very fairly.He certainly could sum up his one sided opinions in a more concise manner."

As the previous reviewer stated, the unit pours out lots of hot but yet unpopped kernels into the bowl (and all over the counter!), where they then pop. You get popcorn flying all over the place, and hot kernels all over as well. Kernels also get stuck between the removable hood and the body, and the hood can then fall off. This creates an even bigger mess. This thing is junk. I've burned myself on the hood while trying to hold it in place for the last time. Time for the dumpster!"
1,Informative primer for corporate bloggers,"A very useful book for those who want to understand how corporate blogging works, how their companies could use blogs and how to succeed in corporate blogging.Among the things I particularly like are:(1) The assertion and further elaboration that Blogging is really about three things: ""Information"", ""Relationships"" and ""Knowledge Management"".(2) ""Be Real: The Scoble Story"" which highlights the importance of authenticity and honesty in blogging.(3) ""External Blogging Personality Types"" where the values of different blogging styles (e.g. The Barber, The Blacksmith, The Bridge, The Window, The Signpost, The Pub, The Newspaper) was discussed."
0,"Good, but not floored","I use tents in the desert at Fort Irwin, and use a Bradley tarp underneath. Even with the tarp, after about 10 nights total spent in the tent, the floor already has holes in it. The floor material is just too thin. I cannot even see how the material of the floor would ever hold up to wet weather if you didn't use a tarp underneath. I should say I am conscientious about putting my boots in the vestibule, but still - that floor material is just way too thin."
0,"Stupid movie, but the kids like it","This movie is so pathetic! The ONLY way I can enjoy it is by reducing my logic to a mere minimum. Dumb yourself down, WAY down if you plan on sitting through its entirety.On the other hand, my kids (13 and 7) thoroughly enjoyed it. My oldest likes it mostly because of the hot babe character. My youngest likes it, well, because he's a child."
0,"rating the DVD quality, not the show","The DVDs I got were very poor quality. They kept breaking into pixels, sometimes to the point that they stopped playing altogether. I rarely get bad DVDs anymore-overall the quality seems to have improved. Having 3 very bad discs in the second season of Glee makes me think they cut corners."
1,father damien and others,"this was such a great book of morals..written for the age of yesteryear.loved it so much, but doubt everyone would."
1,I can breathe,"This is the 2nd Jet AFS-1000B I have purchased for my shop. I have one on the East wall and a second on the West wall (one with the exhaust facing north the other facing south.) This allows a circular motion of clean air into my shop and along with my 6"" dust collection system I cannot believe how must dust is being removed from my shop. There use to be a light film on top of all my equipment, not anymore! Thanks Jet! Oh and did I say I can breathe again too."
0,IT'S ABOUT TIME!!!!!! YEH!.......,I really enjoyed this book because it not only gives you actual pictures of women artists but also gives some history of women artists and there love for the art in the 1900's to the present. Thank you Madamme Chinchilla for your wonderful book and giving credit to all the wonderful women artists we have.

1,A Book For All Ages,"This Series Just gets better and better. Whenever I feel Depressed, I read Harry Potter. Imagine my surprise When I found out that my uncle (Who is in his Forties) did the same thing. Harry Potter is a necessity for everyone's Life."
1,Look a little deeper,"This is actually a neutral review, as I have not yet purchased the product, but after reading the first review, I called the company. I had heard that this was a good company and good product. The Customer service rep told me that as long as you have the number provided in the package, there are no extra costs to run this program. If you lose the number, you can call and they will give it to you. There is also a 30 day return time if you aren't satisfied. I would think that if all customers were as disgruntled as the first reviewer, all products would be returned. Apparently they aren't. I hate to see anyone's name smeared needlessly!"
0,DO NOT BUY THAT BOOK!!!,"I have already found 3 errors in this book:(and I just started reading it...)1. SRS is not even mentioned (the component that allows exchange 2000/2003 to be a part of exchange 5.5 organization and allows for move mailbox migration)2. ADC is presented as ""new with exchange 2003"" - not true - exists in windows 2000/exhange 2000 environment.3. In the system requirements, the book says you need windows 2003 - not true - you can install exchange 2003 on windows 2000 sp3 and up.Ronen"
1,"Great CD, N'Sync Are Maturing","Every teeny-bopper band for kids like us has matured. They found their own style and their own type of music. N'Sync is also maturing. However, we love them more than ever."
1,Great story,"I totally agree with a previous reviewer: this read really brings Euwe to life. I could imagine the different moments of Euwe's life, thanks to the inspired writing of the author. Really recommended for anyone that even remotely likes chess history and/or biographies. Furthermore, the book has a good selection of games, the majority of them with analysis by Euwe himself. It is a paperback, but aside from that, production is first rate, clear text and diagrams. Cons? Well, no hardcover as I said, and only if this had all known Euwe games, with analysis, it would be 5 stars."
1,A good idea that needs to be perfected,"I have to agree with many of the other reviewers. This was a costly item that I was so excited to finally have a reason to give to my son (reward for finally giving up pacifier at 2 1/2). However, Cranky's ""head"" does constantly fall off and there is no way to secure it more premanently. I am strongly considering returning it to the store to avoid the inevitable frustration. It is a really great idea and can help with fine motor skills if it were jsut made a bit better. My son is very bright for his age and engineers a lot of the layouts for his Thomas set, but I do not think any child under the age of four will be able to operate this toy with perfection."
1,WARNING : Slayer can't be played to fresh ears,"Many people complain about Slayer have done for the last years and certainly we can see that there was a change of trend nowadays. I think we got used to attach them to thrash metal, but it was the kind of music that they played and everyone else did as well, back ten years ago. Now we see a new metal scene, full of brutality and anger, and it would sound rather wierd if Slayer played the same sound structures, with riffs and screams, into different melodies, what in fact made them masters. Now I ask: how far can they go?"
0,Deeply Disappointing,"I remember when Danskin products wore like iron and looked as good a year later as the day they were purchased. The quality has suffered tremendously in recent years. The material doesn't last and worse, of five pairs I've bought, two had multiple open seams with gaps as long as five inches that I had to sew shut myself. Terrible."
1,Southern Accents,a favorite Heartbreaker CD. Vendor was both prompt and his description of the product was accurate. Tony
0,human communication,"Woodys books did not even send my book to me, not to mention he will not refund my money. I have been waiting for a month and no book. Woody's Books claims 100% CUSTOMER SATISFACTION but will not live up to it. I would not buy anything from them because you may not receive it."
1,Love the plates but they arrived scratched,I'm sticking with the lighter colors due to scratching. My persimmon 16 piece setting arrived with two dinner plates scratched. I think next time I'll order them as individual place settings as they weren't packed well. Amazon will give me a 20% discount for keeping them.
0,"A disgrace to ""Complete"" series' reputation","950 pages of non sense.* If you are a novice, you will only get confused.* If you are a pro, your intelligence will get insulted.* At times, incomplete, at other times, misguiding if not totally incorrect information.If you,like me, looking to evaluate the XP before you burn your pocket for an upgrade or the full version, look else where.On the contrary, ""Windows 2000 Complete"" was a success and still is a good reference book published by SYBEX."
1,This Book is A Must Read,This refreshingly original book offers a thorough examination of the transnational Muslim Fundamentalist movement and the threat it poses to the national interests of the West. Mr. Dennis offers an unapologetic and unabashed view of the dangerous leading figures in Islamic politics and their deadly intentions. It is about time that leading journalists and the U.S. Government start paying attention to the persuasive arguments of this book before we are exposed to an attack from these groups. Mr. Dennis has done a great service by providing this insightful analysis of the horriying global threat.
1,"For god's sake, just enjoy it.","I doubt these guys are the saviors of rock and roll. However, the Strokes have been a breath of fresh air amid the TRL Britney/50 Cent/Justin music. Yes, it's all been done before...but if you are going to copy the style of a former band, why NOT sound like the Ramones, VU or the Clash? It's fun, it's energetic, and it beats the hell out of 98% of the crap you hear on the radio. So just enjoy it! It's a good CD."
1,The REM classic...,"For all the wonder of New Adventures, the sombre reflection of Murmur and the handful of masterpieces on Out Of Time, it is still Automatic For The People that is REM's masterpiece. From start to finish this is a delight, the pop exuberance that spoiled Out Of Time is finely honed here, so Man On The Moon and Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite are as fine as the ballads. Find The River is the undoubted highlight, ranking with Losing My Religion and Country Feedback as the best REM song, but it's all fine stuff."
0,Unstable code and non-existant support,Could be an interesting game. Only problem is I can't get through an entire game without crashing my Windows XP system. Tried to get a patch from the Creative Assembly site but the link does not work and several emails to Creative Assembly have gotten no response.
1,Vivid and Entertaining,"Four women enjoy a new-found friendship and the beginning of an adventure. But a man enters the picture, and the majestic surroundings lose their significance for some of the participants, as Laurie learns first hand when her innocent friendly gesture is misinterpreted and the harmony of female camaraderie crumbles. Astounded, Laurie finds herself accused in rivalry that she has no part of. For me, the complex and emotional relationships and the vivid images of the canyon made ""Side Canyons"" a delightful reading."
1,Very Good Album,Bradley Powell creates another Acoustic Relaxing Guitar based album with natural sounds that are a Pure reflection of Atmosphere&very comforting.very pure tradtional sounds&very re-freshing to the Ears. a Nice collection of Songs.
0,Clock keeps stopping,"This is a nice looking clock, but the works is screwed up. Have tried 3 new batteries and the thing just won't run after a couple weeks, even though the light shows it has power, worked the first few days but died. Just another poor quality control item, made in Germany no longer means ""quality"" apparently."
0,First time reviewers have let me down,"While browsing through action/adventure titles EXECUTION OF HONOR came up. ...While the premise is original the author should have handed it off to a better writer. The tale of a group of Force Recon Marines avenging the savage murders of their comrades should produce many thrills and surprises. Sadly, in the hands of Thomas Muldoon, this book generates none. The dialouge is staged and wooden, not at all real sounding. ... I never forgot the fact that I was reading a book and a poorly written one at that. ...Muldoon's hero, Joe Craig, is brillant to a fault. He is prepared for every single cotingency that arises. This succeeds in sucking all the suspense out of the story. I never feared for the heroes safety. True some of them are killed but I never became emotionally invested in them. I didn't care. Too much telling and not enough showing.The two stars are for a very good plot."
0,Proofreading a must,"The book I purchased had a lot of typo errors and sometimes the use of the wrong character. I was highly disappointed. Although I try to support as many African-American authors as I can, I found this book to be of poor quality. It had potential, but lost me with all of the errors."
1,Zane Grey Book Review,"My husband likes Zane Grey books, price was right, he would recommend it for other people who enjoy reading Zane Grey books."
0,wasted my money,The 300 piece drill set junk why because when you are drilling a hole the drill bits bend good ones will at least break
0,Please don't further fuel these people's narcissism,"You know, my grandmother always taught me that wealth and success were blessings to be appreciated and contemplated in private, and to be grateful for because they are distributed unequally and can disappear at any time. I have to wonder what these people's families taught them, besides the lie that money makes you important and you have this wealth because you are somehow just better than other people. The vulgarity and transparent social ambition of the participants in this book just make the whole exercise in narcissism that much more lame. The bad design, bad attitudes, bad values, and ignorance on display here show a real waste of the doubtless costly education lavished on these children of vanity and greed. They would be pitiable if they weren't so arrogant.And their apartments are mostly just really ugly."
0,Broke almost immediately,Seems like a decent hose reel as long as you don't have too heavy of a hose. I put a 100' semi-heavy duty hose and it broke on the first use. Probably would be OK with a regular light-duty garden hose.
1,I really like it,"I am a marathon runner, and am using yoga to stretch and cross-train. The workout is great, it helps me to relax, and I'm hopefully getting stronger. I highly recommend it. I think I am getting ready to buy the second video! I personally like the style of the video - he is after all, yoga teacher to the stars!"
1,Spectacular footage,This is an amazing film filled with breathtaking imagery and beautifully composed music. I'd recommend this to all looking for a soothing experience as well as a fun ride.
1,Lon Milo DuQuette,If one wants to understand the Crowley's THOTH Tarot this book is the Best. Concise and complete Lon has captured Crowley'sEsscence.
0,Better left to guys with a pony tail,"It is obvious to me that simplicity is not a virtue in the Linux world. Basic chores like getting a modem to work or installing and removing an application are hair-pulling experiences, the frustration compounded by fragmentary or non-existent documentation. RedHat did the right thing in pulling this monstruosity from the shelves -- it shouldn't even be sold to end users."
1,A Magical Tale,"I loved The Hobbit. It was a fun, delightful read. Tolkien was obviously the narrator, and he had a way of inserting little quips that would make me chuckle. The story moved along quite nicely, as it was short, and you ended the book feeling like the story had come full circle. I would recommend that everyone should read this - it's a classic!"
1,CLASSIC ALL THE WAY,"CONTRADICTION BY CK IS TRULY ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITES.I LOVE CLASSY AND MASCULINE SCENTS AND THIS ONE HAS ITALL.TRUST ME, YOU WILL LOVE IT!!!!!! 5 STARS FOR A TRUEBLUE CLASSIC SMELL GOOD."
0,No better than the others,"Only one screen protector in an order. Very slightly (about 1 mm.) too wide for the screen of my XV-6700, so it's hard to put on. Scratches easily (even the smoothing card that came with it scratched it). Not visibly or tactilely better than any other screen protector I've used over the years, but also no worse.On the plus side, comes with disposable little finger-gloves (like little balloons or condoms) you can wear to prevent fingerprints during installation. Had not seen that before."
1,tasty but puffy,"This mix is very tasty...it has nice texture and cuts easily into slices that can be toasted. Only problem: It rises reeally well! Despite my adjusting for the excessive rising, it still oozes up and up. I've taken to simply mashing it down again manually before the baking cycle starts."
1,#1,"I just bought the cd last night, and already listened to it, 3 times all tghe way through. I thought he was good in O-town, but you should hear him now. His music is great. The theme song to his TV show on MTV ""Soundtrack To Your Life""m is on the cd, and is amazing, and one of my favorite. The cd ends with ""Apology"" a song, you may have seen him play on the TV show, and is just him and his guitar, and brings the cd to a fantastic end. I love it, I would rate it 10 stars, not five."
1,It's Good For What Ails Ya...,"Got problems? Feeling run-down and out of sorts? Well, a nice stay at Brittlehouse Manor will fix you right up! Doctor Storm (Michael Gough) along with his teeny tiny henchman, Frederick (Skip Martin) and his nefarious nurse (Ellen Pollock), will get you straightened out. Of course, you must not question their methods. What? You don't like being lobotomized? Scalpals make you queazy? Come on now, you simply must get over these irrational fears and hang-ups! Allow the doctor to work his magic, and join his growing legion of zombie slaves! It's all good therapy. Do watch out for the mysterious, murderous, pink goo-man though! He's bloody dangerous! HORROR HOSPITAL is packed w/ enough insane idiocy to keep any schlock-maniac as happy as a termite in a woodpile. Decapitations! Nudity! Mad science! Hippies! And so much more! Buy immediately..."
0,Science and religion don't play well together,"I am embarrased to admit that I own this book. A book about dinosaurs should not have anything about religion in it, unless you believe that dinosaurs had a religion. Science is the meandering search for truth; religion is about accepting an established version of the truth. If you are interested in the genealogy of dinosaurs I recommend the BBC ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" followed by the BBC ""Walking with Prehistoric Beasts""."
1,The Web that has no Weaver,"This book is very interesting if you are interested in Chinese Medicine. You can get a very strong idea of how Chinese approach medicine from the idea of the whole organism in view. Their interpretation of what is occurring in the body is completely at odds with our methods, that is, organs have different functions than they do in our system. I was looking for some gems of wisdom which we don't get in our methods, and I found them scattered throughout the book. Very interesting reading."
1,This book is awesome!!,"This book is short but gives a lot of info on how the bsb started out. The book gives info on each band member. It is an excellent book if you want to know all about your fav bsb member. The only problem is it is an old book and the ages are wrong, but who cares about the ages of five totally hot guys, if you are a true fan you know the recent ages of each member.(The pics are so cute!)"
1,Scalp Therapy,I've used Nioxin in the past and had pretty good results. I found that using it for a couple of months then changing to another product for awhile did best for my hair. The one thing about the Scalp Therapy they put out now is that the ingredients and even the name of the product is different and along with that is the results I get...not as good as the original product was. I do like the minty smell..at least they left it in the ingredients even if it is not as noticable as it used to be. My question is why change something that already works???
1,Great Hammock...Great Price !,"I wasn't sure if this hammock would actually hold up to all the great reviews b/c the price is so low compared to all the others. I am glad I bought it. The quality is excellent. It is very soft against the skin. It is big enough to hold myself, my husband, and our children at once. It dries very quickly after a hard rain. I've had it for a little over a week and it's been used quite a bit already. So relaxing!"
1,This Show Changed my Life,"This show manages to use a serious, gritty, believable, sci-fi backdrop to explore issues of war, peace, politice, religion, hope, doubt, apocolypse, forgivenss, trauma, surviving, guilt, loyalty and how one ship, built by the hands of man and machine and blessed by gods, can change 2 races forever.It also never lets up on the cylong killing, super graphics destructo action.Simply put, the best show I have yet seen. And will ever see.I will always miss you, Commander Adama, Laura, Thrace, Baltar, the 12, the 12 and Daniel...if only we knew you."
1,Sunlite Pedal Extenders,I like a bit more room on the bicycle crank area for the pedals an these extenders work well. Good quality materials and good fit.
1,What's expected,"These thrermal blankets perform exactly as advertised. They are very thin mylar or something, take up very little space, but are extremly good at reflecting heat. Will help keep things hot or cold. If used for an emergency, should protect one from the cold, however keep in mind these are only designed to reflect heat, basically reflect radient heat. You also would need some sort of insulation such as a regular blanket on top of this for total protection. Its a good product, well worth the cost, and if its all you have in an emergency, would certainly be helpful."
0,abysmal,"Utterly awful in every respect, from the acting to the rendition of the story to the ludicrously campy gothic setting. Get the 2007 masterpiece version instead. This one is a pathetic travesty of a wretched mockery of the novel."
0,Buy Brainage instead ...,I totally regret buying this game. I bought it thinking it'd be more like Brainage and even got to play the demo of it but it was totally not what I expected when I got the real game. I'm totally disappointed bcuz there's not a lot of mind games and I'm sure everyone scores about the same and the way they score you makes you feel like your stupid. I should of just waited til' I found a store that carried Brainage instead. That game scores you by the age of your brain not by the weight of your brain. Totally not worth your money. If you really wanna play this rent it from BlockBuster or something cuz you'll get tired of it real quick !!! I know I did. (T~T)
1,great price,more affordable than buying at a home improvement center. Badger is a great brand and we are very happy with this purchase
1,Full of suspense!,"I saw this movie about 10 years ago and I wish I read the book first. The book was great though, except that I knew, for the most part what was going to happen.This book is a quick read.. you'll be hooked in no time. At first you'll probably pause and think.. did he just do that? It's a great book full of suspense and drama. This is only my second Stephen King book but I'm looking forward to reading more."
0,A movie fans will love... but only the fans.,"Been a fan of the Spice Girls for quite some time now. Love their music, but I can't lie. This movie has one of the worst story lines ever created. I really hate that part when they say they're really hot and need a fan, then a screaming girl comes running in. I mean, come on, that was just too lame. The editor must have been on crack when he let that slip. As much as I hate to do it, I can't go any higher than 2 stars on this one. Sorry girls."
0,"Forget it, try Letters at 2 AM instead","I really tried, but couldn't get past the first chapter of this book. I'd picked it up after falling in love with Letters at 2 AM. My theory is that he's a great essayist but not a great novelist. If this is the only one you've tried, don't give up. Check out Letters at 2 AM, a brilliant, honest, collection of essays."
0,impossible to (...) any more than this,"If you are thinking of punishing your neighbors you should buy this album and play this at full volume. Actually, the same goes if you are looking to punish yourself. Ridiculous music by ridiculous people. Save your money."
1,GREAT CD!,"I am a big Jewel fan so I bought this cd to have a sneak peek at her next album. The song she wrote with Ty Murray, ""Til We Run Out of Road"" is excellent! Enjoy!"
0,Rip Off,"I bought a battery sold as brand new. It came opend dirty and clearly used. I plugged it in anyway and it would not hold a charge at all. I sent it back with an angry message and was sent another dirty, old, and clearly used battery. It at least took a charge but it won't hold it for more than a few hours. Very, very, unhappy."
1,Pancakes Anyone?,"I have recently become a fan of the WoodWick Candles. They are asthetically very pretty. I also like candles that smell like I've been baking. However, this smells less like caramel and more like maple syrup. I recently had a guest who said my house smelt like Pancakes and Maple Syrup! She was right. I guess that's not a bad thing. It smells like I've been slaving away making Pancakes all morning. Pancakes anyone?"
0,Died and disappeared,"It died after 13 mos. To their credit, the company agreed to honor the warranty, so I sent it back. To their discredit, I never heard from them again."
0,Doormat Becomes Desperate Housewife,"I'm not sure what irritated me more: the fact that the book's protagonist allowed herself to become her husbands fantasy woman, sacrificing her business, her cats, her fantasies of her wedding, her fantasies of her home, her Christmas tree, and her comfortalbe wardrobe...Or the fact that once they move to CT, she pretends to be this down-to-earth chick living in ""the country"" like she's in the simple life, but in fact, is living in suburban CT housewife hell, complete with SUV and expensive casual wardrobe. Anyone who lives in or near the barely-fictionalized Fairfield County-area of CT knows that it's hardly the country haven described in the book, but a bastion of snobbery and pretentiousness. I can't accept the new Alice as down to earth, but rather just a different brand of snob."
1,Lord of the Rings-The Two Towers,"This is an awesome movie!! This animation of 'Tree Beard' was amazing! I would definitely recommend this movie to ALL of my friends. I purchased the DVD-Lord of the Rings-Fellowship of the Ring & I AM going to buy LOTR-TTT as soon as it becomes available! I would pay to go & see it again & again & again....Aragon is a babe!! The ending was a little upsetting until I realized that there is another movie coming out. I hope it will be coming up pretty soon, I don't think I can wait too long to see another LOTR movie. I am seriously thinking about going out & buying the books so I have them as well."
0,A terrible book!,"I was insulted to have to pay for this awful excuse for a book. Ms. Block received an MFA from Columbia University? Clearly, she learned nothing more than how to be smug and un-funny. Revolting characters, stupid scenes, a waste of time and paper."
1,For The Love of Joe!,"I can't BELIEVE I haven't written a review on this cd. What can I say? I almost got a ticket flying down I-10 on my way to Baton Rouge with the top down listening to this cd for the very first time. I LOVE ME SOME HIM! I will buy ANYTHING this man sings. Why, because he CAN sing and he can make me smile. That's what its all about anyway. What makes you smile. I can review each and every single song on this cd. I'm buying it for the 4th time now. Damn thieves in Houston....lol From the beginning to the ending...this cd ranks #1 with me. I wish I could give it 100 stars. I'm awaiting the new one now. I can detect Joe basically on any song from the radio. His voice is unique..or could it be I've listened to him so much he's like my own child calling me in a crowd of a 1000 people. EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE SOME JOE....all of Joe, that is."
0,Its ok...,I had gotten this book sometime ago even through I don't know exactly when but when I did get this book I was very disapointed. Michelle did an exellent job finding out information about psychic vampires but it wasn't my cup of tea. I was hoping that the book psychic vampireism would at least teach you basic and advance psychic vampiric tecnects to drain the energy of human beings but sadly theres is very little. But then again very few books ever do. I'm just a power hungry man.;)
0,Don't bother with this headset,"Unless you like electronic screeching while you try to talk on the phone that is....I bought this headset on July 15 and by mid August, it started making a terrible feedback noise whenever I tried to use it. Unfortunately, I have just surpassed the return date by a few days so I can't return it even though it's defective and still new. I have an older one that still works great so I suppose it's a hit and miss thing. If you do buy this product, make sure the company has a return policy that is longer than 39 days."
1,Very sexy and fun!,"This product was great. It smells and tastes wonderful and doesn't leave any sort of weird residue, so it's comfortable to wear. It also adds a lot of fun to the bedroom. ;)"
0,not happy with product,"The good...the product did arrive on time and was well packaged. The bad...the container doesn't seal well. When I fill the container with water, it spills out when I try to flip it over to put in the dispensing tray."
0,Did not like it at all,I thought this was going to have lots of songs and it did not. It only has a few songs and the rest is 2 people reading off the book. Very boring.
0,"Useless, Horrible, and Filled with Typos!","This book was filled with an unbelievable number of mistakes. On every test, it always gives wrong line numbers and misspells many, many, many words. Often (a few times a page) it forgets to leave spaces between words. There are no tables to convert your sample tests into SAT scores. And to top it off, the answer guide is often wrong. This was the worst $10 that I have ever spent. Save yourself money, don't buy this horrible book!"
0,Worked great for thee months...,"It worked great for three months, then died. I tried putting fresh batteries in it, but that didn't help. Will never buy another Equus product again."
0,Disappointed,"Purchased system figuring it would be better than my old Siemens 2.4 GHz system. Unless you live in a tiny house, forget it. Bad reception from as little as 20 feet away. Also, handsets cannot be named so you have to memorize where handsets are by number when paging or transferring calls."
1,No Kick it up a Notch and not an extended version,now this product is great i love it and would highly reccomend it i just have two things to say about it there is no kick it up a notch music video at the end credits and it is not an extended version usually when disney channel puts out an original movie they make it an extended edition but instead the deleted scenes are seperate as special features and i would've liked to see them in the movie because of this i take away one star but i still give it a 4/5 i would reccomend this to any phineas and ferb or disney channel fan its got fun special features great movie and interactive menus with hidden surprises so definitely pick this up
1,Wonderful series!,I am so happy I purchased this series on BlueRay. Now I can watch it for years to come. It has a lot of bonus material and interviews with cast and crew. Very worth it.
1,Get this one,"In the past, I may have been able to pick about 1 or 2 songs off of a Cross Movement CD that I really liked. This album is totally different. There are about six songs that are absolutely incredible. None of the songs are subpar. A great album from start to finish...and I totally mean that. The final song is like the finale and it does not disappoint at all. My favorites are ""louder"", ""Clap Your Hands"", ""Get That"", and ""The Last Cypha."" But as I said, all of the songs are good, so be sure to get this album."
0,This product doesn't work on my board and is supports a short list of boards,Can someone tell me what boards can I buy for this memory?
1,Not like all other boy bands,"If you like BSB, *NSYNC, or hip hop, you'll like this CD. It's a mix of the above but they have their own sound. If you like a change in what you're listening to you should definately check this one out."
1,Enjoyed it!,"Read this series starting with the next to latest, went back and picked up from the beginning. I like this series set in an earlier time in the 1900's, in San Francisco. This one took place after the big earthquake destroyed much of San Francisco. It takes place in one of my favorite spots, the Monterrey Peninsula.....a fun mystery."
1,The Music Captures the Essence of the Movie,"If you like the movie, you will like the CD. Once you like the CD, you will think that the movie was even better than you thought it was."
0,ehh..,its no different than the factory cables that came with the wii.. and by no different i mean I see no difference in the quality of the image...
1,Fabulous program,I love this program first aired on 60 Minutes. I facilitate wellness workshops and always mention this as a great explanation on the problems with not getting enough sleep.
1,Bags,This product is exactly what is described on the package. It does what it is suppose to. I like this product
0,"Not all bad, but pretty ""Earthy-crunchy""","The basic premise in this book is good - you don't need to punish your dog to train her, but it is a little off the wall sometimes. For example, the author suggests that your should play music for your dog while you are out of the house and leaving her alone (good suggestion), but then goes on to say that the best type of music to play is New Age. It also suggests not buying prepared food for your dog, instead feeding her raw food which is the only type to contain ""life energy"". I love my pets, but all of this goes a little too far for me. the only reason I don't send this book back is because it only cost $8 to begin with and would cost me $3 to send it back. For $5 I'll keep it and try to get past the tree hugging."
1,Creative,"THis game is a fun beat-button match with a catchy variety of songs. It's especially enjoyable when challenging friends. Though sometimes you wonder how the game rates your freestyle, overall it's challenging with a good replay value."
1,the platoon soundtrack is unique!,"i like the soundtrack because it is a mix of classical and oldies music!! And it reminds me of the sacrifices the people in vietnam made for our freedom which today is taken for granted.Sarah, age 14, Ontario"
1,Long Hot Summer,"Sweet Dream Baby by Sterling WatsonOn a sultry summer river, two young people explore small town life in the backwater of Florida . This tapestry of a story mesmerized me with its rich characters and tangled landscapes, its troubled families and brooding mysteries. If you appreciate musical prose and gripping plots, you will relish this haunting book. I can't wait for the sequel so I can learn more about Travis and Delia."
1,Laugh out loud funny,It is absolutely hilarious especially the deleted scenes it is a must watch each time i see it i still laugh till i fall to the ground
0,couldn't get it to sit level,"I purchased this so both of my cats could sit at the window together. I has high hopes when I took it out of the box. It was the perfect size. The problem i had was getting it it sit level on the window sill. The ledge part of my window frome that you hook into isn't level with the window sill. I actually don't know anyone that has that edge level with the sill. Anyway, I struggled hooking both sides onto the window and it sat at a 45 degree angle. Because of how it hooks onto the window frame, the platform hovered over the sill by about an inch. That is what casued the huge slant. I tried everything to get it level but it was a complete failure. So I had to eat the cost of shipping it twice, to me and back to them. I'm still frustrated that it cost me $30 and I have nothing to show for it except for 2 unhappy cats."
1,This pan works for what I need.,"I like this pan. I line it with foil and cook bacon in the oven (25 minutes @ 400.) It just barely fits into one of my side by side gas ovens.Other reviewers mentioned it warping. MOST metal (particularly aluminum) will deform when heated. Mine, like other reviewers, however, came with a warp, but that doesn't interfere with the this purpose specific item. (Aluminum will warp when heated or cooled abruptly.)The rolled edges ARE the way that professional cookware is made. The pan I got had smoothed edges - half roll - and I don't think you could cut yourself on it without a lot of trying.So, all in all a 4 star due to the mishandling. It should NOT have been warped out of the package, but I would put the blame on UPS for that particular problem, although I can't prove it."
0,X - tremely disappointing,This was nowhere as good as the TV show. It was overlong and boring. It very nearly put me off the show.
1,Hill leaves me wanting more!,"This book (and the sequel) is great, one of the reasons being that it affected me so deeply. I read this book when I was 14, and I have read it 3 more times since then. This was the book that started my interest in the genre of fantasy. The only complaint is that it's not as long as I'd like it to be. Of course, that didn't bother me back then, but now (after reading the likes of Robert Jordan) I am left fiending!!!And Mr. Hill's books are becoming VERY hard to find. A pity...."
0,Horrible Recording,This is a horrible CD. It was actually released without the permission of The Pogues and they (The Pogues) ask you to please not purchase it.
1,What a Godsend!,"I have had an estrangement from my son for the last few years. I have shed many tears missing him. His wife refused to allow him to see any of the members of his family. No matter how many times I tried to re-connect, I was rebuffed. I was hurt and angry, even to the extent of calling him a wimp. Once I read this book, I realized that I was doing everything the wrong way. I tried several of the author's suggestions. Happily, I am now in touch with my son. We speak on the telephone and we e-mail. Hopefully, we will be together soon. This book was a Godsend."
1,Required Reading,"This book should be required reading for anyone contemplating a purchase of property on the eastern coast. While the ""pulpit preacher"" tone gets tired, we are seldom aware of just how much change occurs over a relatively brief period of time. Pay your money now or a million when your lot is under water in another 30 years."
1,Super 8 (Two-disc Blu-Ray/DVD combo + Digital copy),"Great Flick! Our whole family thoroughly enjoyed this movie! Keeps you wondering what will happen next! From JJ Abrams and Steven Speilberg, it's gotta be good and it is."
1,Great Product; Very Easy to Use,"I purchased one of these for my wife and I, and several more to give as Christmas gifts. It's excellent. The picture quality is very good, the internal memory is very convenient and more than addequate, and it is so easy to use. We were loading pictures from the PC and camera memory card within seconds. As others before have mentioned, you don't need the software that comes with the device. I have a Compaq computer with Windows XP and it linked without any trouble at all using the USB cable that came with the frame. I highly recommend this frame over other comparable models, and definately over lesser, smaller models, for it's ease of use, quality and value."
1,"Epic, Educational, Unparalled",I have listened to many audio books. This one I return too. It is read exquisitly. Clear and engaging. Every few months I check to see if there is a digital version of the audio released as my cassettes are starting to deteriorate. If you come across this grab it and savor it. If you can't then buy the book. It is a compelling read.
1,Great tasting tea,We love this flavor of tea and cannot find it in stores. These large tea bags make more than one cup of tea.
0,BITCHY AND SUPERFITIAL,"the author made it clear who she love in this book .she made catherine out to be a bitter,fat brood mare.henri mistress diana as woman of beauty ,class and dignity.catherine was dealing with husband who made it clear he could never love her,preganacy after preganacy,and hostile court."
1,I love this iron!,"I bought this iron after deciding there was no way I could justify paying $120 for a Chi. I was not disappointed with my purchase! This iron is great. It's the perfect width (I feel 1 inch is too small, 2 inches too big), and it's pretty affordable. I have tried other irons in the past, but this is by far my favorite."
0,Cheaply Made,"I had ordered 2 of these to add to a DJ setup and I do realize that they are cheap and all, but when I went to test them, one sounds great and the second one sounds like trash! It sounds like the woofer has ""popped"" and will need replaced."
0,Can't set the Darn thing,"I've followed the instructions many times and I can't set the time or date accoding to the instructions. I've looked up the instructions online and found diffferent variations for the same watch. Either this watch is just broke, or none of the instructions are right? I wasn't expecting to have an issue so I didn't save the Box container, or package slip needed to return it, Dumb Me."
0,Disappointing,"Perhaps it's understandable that a film 37 years after its release no longer is funny. Juvenile and unimpressive, unfortunately, and severely dated."
0,Horrible!,"I'm shocked at all these rave reviews. This movie is so horrible!First of all, it speeds through a plot that drags with no body. This movie is confusing and empty of a good plot and dialogue.I liked Krull way better than this and for some reason Krull got worse reviews. *shrugs* I don't understand. I guess to each their own.One thing I can say it is better than Beastmaster 2, so if you are up for a cheesy sorcery movie than go for it, but honestly there are so many better fantasy movies out there. If I had a second chance, I wouldn't have wasted my dollar on renting it."
1,Great Desk Decoration,"The cockpit opens, everyone wants to open it up.It looks just like the pictures show, keeps me smiling through the day.."
0,I didnt even use it,Never used it Never used it Never used it Never used it Never used it i bought for cna class never wore it
0,"Boring, Boring...and did I say Boring?","In a nut shell, one of the most boring, poorly written books I've read in a long time. Put it down after 200 pages...I love Celtic history but there needs to be an interesting story line to move it along....didn't find it here!"
0,Kind of a rip off,You can buy the entire series for like 15 bucks. (Pardon the pun) Why buy just season 1 for $19.99????
1,ITU Information,I really enjoyed using this book as a reference. This book displays diagrams and examples that are very helpful in creating an ITU. I plan to use this book in the future to create a curriculum.
1,COMPLETE INSPECTOR LYNLEY MYSTERIES,"MY ONLY PROBLEM WITH THESE DVD,s IS THERE ARE NO SUBTITLES. IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW THE PLOT WHEN YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE SAYING."
1,Well worth the hunt,"Back in 92, Hot Blood got a minor airplay in Northern California. The song stuck in my head for seven years before buying the CD. Obviously, the disk is much more thoughtful than one woman's obsession. It will be a long term keeper in my CD collection!"
1,Very Good GPS,"I'm very happy with this GPS because of It's simplicity of use and response is perfect. It is not the best GPS but for common people who sometimes travel is great! The Bluetooth with my nokia's 6311 and 5800 worked perfect. Speed of connection with satellite here in my country 7 out of 10.I think It have two cons:1. The external antenna makes it uncomfortable to manage, and seems to be very sensible.2. Lack of the function to save the route."
0,sorely disappointed,"I have a hard time believing this book was written by the same person who wrote ""The Secret History"". It took me nearly two weeks to drag through several tedious subplots to finally discover there is no ending. I agree with a previous reviewer, this book definitely needed the aid of an editor."
0,By no means the best,"To me, this was an inferior version of Robin Hood, simply because I couldn't get a handle on the central character and still don't know whether or not I was supposed to take him seriously. Poor casting for the lead (and, for all I know, equivocal directing). Much of the film was good, but this spoiled it for me. (By contrast, Uma Thurman was wonderful as Marion, although it was a pity we didn't get to hear her speak more.)"
1,Great television.,"I found myself drawn into the series from the first episode. The actors are fanatastic. Most of them are normally relegated to secondary status in just about every instance I have ever seen them perform, but they are all wonderful character actors and they truly shine in this environment. And who knew Katy Sagal was such an incredible actress? I found her a good comedienne but she certainly deserves the Golden Globe she won for her protrayl of Gemma in this series.The show itself is very well written with an interesting story arch and numerous beta stories that tie the whole into a neat package. I can't recommend the series enough. One thing, it does portray extreme violence in a graphic manner, as well as regularly depicts druguse, criminal activity and murder to further the stories. Anyone that may be offended by such things, even in a fictional way, should avoid this series. Obviously children should not be allowed to watch the series either."
1,Best book ever!,"This is by far the best book I've ever read. It exposes liberals for what they are -- worthless! Ann does this with wit, style and panache. Did I forget elan? This is a must read for all Americans. Socialists need not apply."
1,Its one of the best books I've ever read.,"I am 9 years old. The story is about how Lily's gets through all of the bad times in her life when her Dad goes off to war and her best friend moves away. But when Albert moves in, things start to brighten up for Lily."
0,Not his best.,"I am a lifelong reader of John Jakes. I enjoyed the Kent Family books and The North and South trilogy. However, this book lacks Jakes rhythmic writing style and good storytelling; this book is not interesting. This book is intended to be volume II of a three volume series. At the ending of American Dreams, Jakes more or less has shut the door on these characters. Jakes last good book was North and South."
1,Lord Of The Rings- What Fun!,"When I first got htis game I thought it was going to be really hard for me, but when I played it was so much fun I couln't stop playing! Exellent Graphics and really great storyline! If anyone seen the movie and wants the game have it! Its a must have! If you think this game may be hard the stradegy guide is a good way to beat the game and its just a good thing to have. Lord Of the Rings to towers is a game for any type of teenager game player!"
1,The Soundtrack to all the Parties,"This is currently the Number One CD here in Korea, and is the party soundtrack of the summer. Leading off with ""Smooth"", then to ""Shake your Bon Bon"" to ""Mambo 5"" and ""Genie in a Bottle"", it sets the mood for the rest of the 18 tracks. Had this been put out Stateside, it would have been number one for 12 weeks. You really should pick up on this one!"
0,wasted my time,The device only worked when plugged into the same circuit. I returned the purchase. I would not recommend this product.
0,Incomplete-hasn't shown up yet,"5 to 9 business days shipping turning out to be 15, but that's O.K. it was a present for my Mom...When it does show up, I'm sure she'll love it."
1,Encyclopedic and highly readable book on Special Functions,"This is one of the best books on Mathematics I have read recently;reading it gave me pleasure similar to I had felt while reading classics such as Hardy's Pure Mathematics and Titchmarsh's Theory of Functions about 30 years ago. Starting with a thorough and encyclopedic treatment of Gamma Functions , the book develops, rightly, the thesis of grandeur and ubiquitousness of Hypergeometric Functions,to then cover some of the most important special functions known today. And the beauty lies in precise,to the point, yet historically complete and 'multi-angled' as well as rigourous treatment of every topic covered, with a large number of exercises of nontrivial nature dealing successfully with details which probably could not be included in the main text because of desire to keep the size of the book within reasonable limits. Nonetheless, the authors have delightfully and almost magically been able to cover a lot of ground in a mere 600 odd pages."
1,Episode List,"According to tvshowsondvd.com (http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/newsitem.cfm?NewsID=2517), this set includes:Disc 1The Pilot (a.k.a. ""Romantic Improvisations""; Season 1)Met Someone (Season 1)Virtual Reality (Season 2)Cold Feet (Season 2)Giblets for Murray (Season 3)Special Features:Exclusive extras with participation from Helen Hunt and Paul ReiserOther Sony PreviewsDisc 2Our Fifteen Minutes (Season 3)The Alan Brady Show (Season 3)Yoko Said (Season 4)The Finale (Parts 1, 2, & 3; Season 4)Disc 3Citizen Buchman (Season 5)The Penis (Season 5)The Birth (Parts 1 & 2; Season 5)Letters to Mabel (Season 6)Moody Blues (Season 6)Disc 4Le Sex Show (Season 6)The Conversation (Season 6)Paved with Good Intentions (Season 7)The Final Frontier (double-length series-ending Season 7 episode)I am happy to have new episodes, but the rest of the season sets would be much better. I already have seasons 1 and 2, so I don't neet them again on this disk. I could also do without anything Mabel related."
1,Great for parties,"I recently had a party and made all my hors d'oeuvres from this book--smoked salmon sandwiches, turkey sandwiches, sun-dried tomato dip, etc. Usually I just buy everything for parties, but these recipes were so easy and the results were great."
1,Citizen Eco-Drive Watch,"The watch is fine and I believe it's a good value for an ECO-Drive watch however, the band on the watch fits an eight grader not an adult. I had to purchase a new band out of box. Product arrived as promised and I am satisfied, except for the band. Citizen Eco-Drive Men's Chronograph Canvas Watch #AT0200-05E"
0,Poor book,"(...)In a nutshell... This book compares very poorly to the Usbornehistory books covering earlier periods (my daughter and I lovethose books). This book is only suitable for older children, sincethey squeeze in a lot of text. What I really don't like is theartibrary, idiosyncratic and often idiotic selection of whatevents of the 20th century are ""notable""."
1,Spell binding read,Wonderful and creative. J.K never disappoints and often leaves me reading for much longer than I anticipated. 2 thumbs up.
1,Great,"These pants feel the same as the work shorts that dickies sell. They are very comfortable and keep you from getting your legs cold in the winter. I think these pants are great for work and outside of work, they are casual looking pants that you can wear anywhere."
0,Never got to find out how good it is...,"Ordered the refurbished 4040 as an Amazon ""deal"". Unit looks to be perfect cosmetically, but it won't hold a charge. After hours of charging, it only reads two bars out of five. Back it goes, for refund. Never buying refurbished electronics again..."
0,Works like a non reusable camera!,"In the beginning it will work fine, but then it will malfunction out of the blue and take your important files with it. The Maxtor 40 Gig External Drive erased all my work out of no ware one sunny day and I used a file recovery to retrieve my work. This happened 3 times where the third time I couldn't get nothing back and now it just plain doesn't work. Stay away from Maxtor it's not even worth the cheap price!"
0,EA Keeps Missing the Point - do they read reviews?,"I agree with all the people who criticized this game here. This game is terrible. The manager feature is an excellent idea only to be ruined by the games playability. The graphics are ok; when you see the player faces upclose, they're actually pretty scary. I really don't think that EA have been reading their FIFA soccer reviews from prior game releases or they're just ignoring them. They should stop the graphics development and concentrate on the game itself."
1,cant get enough,halo fans will buy this for yrs to come both newcomers and pros happy with the game and special content
1,The Best Books I've Ever Read,The Harry Potter books are amazing. They are the best books I've ever read and whenever i read a book that is not part of the Harry Potter series I dont like it as much as I no I would have if I hadn't had such high expectations. So all i do is wait for the next Harry Potter book to come out so i can read another great book that will last me until the next one comes out. The only thing i'd like Rowling to do is write a little faster!
1,A Winner!,"Frankly, this is the best book Feist has ever written. He can write great series (Riftwar etc.) But this is one incredible piece of fantasy. BUY IT!"
0,Boo... this book ain't that good.,"I really enjoy a good ghost story, which is why I gleefully bought this book (very cheap, thankfully). Long ago, when a mere teen, I read a book or two by Holzer, and can still remember having the feeling that it seemed contrived. So I can't say I wasn't prepared for it. Still, I'm disappointed. Holzer's accounts are quite simplistic and at times downright silly. If they are based on actual events, then they are written in such a way that makes their plausability so suspect, that it's impossible to take the book seriously. Therefore, it's mere fluff, simply a means of wasting a few hours if you've got nothing better to do. And if you're in no mood to get spooked."
0,Can't believe Mel consented to be in this movie.,"Started off great and ended up a huge flop. Now let's see. We have an alien race that conquered space, but cannot break into a basement door or out of a wooden pantry door. They navigated through space to find earth, but needed signs in corn fields for local directions. Horrible screen play. Really bad movie."
0,Another piece of crap,I've been waithing a long time for this movie to be released in a better form. I got my copy today and I was totally disapointed. It's not any better than all the other junk out there. And NO subtitles. If I had known that I would have never purchased it.
1,BackPacking Tripod,I bought this to take on a week long backpacking trip inside the Grand Canyon. It worked well for me. I would recommend this to others.
1,MuDvAyNe GoDs,"This album is unbelievable. A piece of modern rock history. There arent many other bands that can come close to the scope of mudvayne's music, lyrics, ideas and messages. All of these come together to form a surreal experience that will immerse you in a land made of music."
1,Easily the best kept secret of the show.,"When thinking of M*A*S*H, usually Season 1, 11, or major changing ones like 4 (first Hunnicutt and Potter) and 6 (first Winchester.) come to mind. But 2 can easily hold it's own. With great episodes like ""The Sniper"" and ""Carry On, Hawkeye"" it's a must-see for any fan. It's nice that they finally got around to putting the whole thing in one place."
1,Great For kids who already know letters!,"I am a nanny for two preschoolers: one 4.5 and one 5. They have letters and phonics down but making the transition to actually decoding words has not been easy. This video gives them a fun way to remember ""how"" to do it. It has great colors, music, and repetition that go along with fun ways to remember what a vowel is and even sound blends. I am very impressed with this...they are not big into TV/videos but they ask to watch this twice a day and I can see a difference in their eagerness to learn! Great job, LeapFrog!"
1,Good fun,"This movie was good for laughs! Several laugh out loud moments. 2 immature new police officers thrown back into high school to locate the supplier of a new drug that recently caused the death of a teenager. This was actually much funnier than I had expected it to be. If you are looking for a light, funny comedy this would be a good choice!"
1,For dog lovers and children,I really enjoyed this book. I read to my children and they really liked it.Lisa Cohoe
1,This is the one!,"Lehmann's lyrics - alliteratively laud And eerily echo - an English epic. How summoned Hrothgar - Hygelac's sister's son, The bold but not - boastful Beowulf To meet the monster, - murderer of men, Grendel, greedy ghoul, - haunter of Hart Hall. Cunningly he killed - the cursed one And the monster-mother - of the mere. But when he dared - the deadly dragon The greathearted Geat - gave up his Ghost. She truly tells - the twisted tale In words that warriors - declaimed with drink And unsheathed sword - in days departed. Other translations, - tepid and tedious, Pale before her - poetic power. (A clever companion - Gardner's ""Grendel"".)"
1,A good game.,This game is good. It's challenging but it's good and is a lot of fun. There are two views. The first level is the top view and then the second is the side scroller. A fun game you're able to get plenty of powerups and firepower. This game isn't bad at all
0,disappointed,"Usually a great product but these are very hard to use and after cutting for a while, they freeze up and can't be opened. Tried spraying CRC and that worked for a short itme. I use these for cutting small circles of fabric to top jelly jars and cut many yards at a time. It seems they are defective."
1,Should've released it as the complete second season,The first season of this show was where it started. The sceond season was when it started to get reall good. All of these episodes are good but i'm kinda getting bored with Badda-Bing Badda-Boom. Tabitha is a good charcter and she comes back to the institute in the third season. She leaves the brotherhood house when Mystique came back. She wasn't happy to learn that Avalanche had tried to join the X-men but she soon straightens them out. Power Surge focuses on Jean and her teleapthy problem. The team helps her get under control soon. This is a great bunch of episodes and i'm sad that the series was cancelled. It's still on Cartoon Network though.
1,Hip-Hop album of the year???,"Common's ""Be"" or Kanye's ""Late Registration""? Either way Kan wins. Either way we all win. This is what hip hop was meant to be."
1,Great travel mug,"I've tried a number of different travel mugs in the past, but the Contigo Autoseal is the best for keeping coffee hot longer, and for not leaking."
0,Wrong adapter pictured for keyboard,"As the last reviewer wrote, we also ordered the adapter to go along with the keyboard we ordered and held both items until Christmas. The adapter was not the proper adapter for the keyboard as pictured."
0,Book not in good condition,"I got the book to have it signed by its author Bob Schieffer. Unfortunately, the book was not in a good condition at all. Half of the front page was ripped off and there was a ""low prize"" button on the cover that I could not get off."
1,Beautiful,"All her life,Mona believed that if she could just win a beauty pageant she would feel special.It becomes a life-long goal,an obsession in fact.Then she falls pregnant.Not willing to give up her dream,she lets her best friend bring up her daughter as her own.But then,that very good friend is arrested,falsely accused of murder,and Mona is stuck looking after her own kid(how awful!)all while trying to become Miss.America.Soon,she may have to decide between a tiara and her own little girl.This is a really fun,enjoyable girls movie."
0,not goood 4 guineas,i have a book at home saying that u should NOT feed a guinea pellets that have those different type of dried veggies.they had said they will choke if eaten.juss wanted to let chu know
1,Maybe the best Christian book I've read,"I have read and re-read this book. Should have reviewed it long ago! It puts in order what God has planned. It clearly explains the Bible passages I had misunderstood all my life. If you have to have only one book in your library, besides your Bible, this is what you need. I feel until I read this I was very much in the dark in understanding my faith of 60 years!"
1,A must see!,"When I watched IAM (The Documentary)in a small town historical theater, I was so mesmorized by the message that so resonated with what I know to be true, I determined then that I would procure a DVD. This is an amazing 'movie', and especially needs to be seen by young people who feel they can't make a difference in the world-that the world is very jaded-and that the world is being damaged beyond anything they can fix. Please purchase and share with loved ones, little ones, and those in your life who have given up. It's that important."
1,LISTEN to me,This band is cooler live than me crapping on your face. These cds just hold you over till they come to your slum.But they are still good.Buy it.
0,it was a terrible movie,"This movie is not only boring, but DEFINATELY NOT worth a five star rating. I have seen many, many of the classics and it is not up to par with any of them. If you watch both evil Dead movies...it does not make any sense. Ash drives up to the cabin with his girlfriend Linda in the first movie. He beheads her with her a shovel. In the second one her has a girlfriend , Linda, who is beheaded with a shovel the same exact way. Hello....Does this make sense to anyone. I'm sorry, but it definately lives up to its name....Sequel. Even if it were meant to be humorous it is lacking in that too."
0,kind of misleading,"The amazon description was:leatherCasual fashion belt that moves with you and conforms to the waistExpands approximately 1"" without extra tabs or attachmentsPadded leather tabs and loopSatin silver finished buckleWear with jeans or sportswearThe first Item ""Leather"" is misleading, the belt actually states ""Genuine Leather with Bonded Lacing made in china""So the only real leather part is the portion on both ends that buckle together, the mesh or majority of this beltis in fact not real leather at all. That would probably explain other reviewers comments about longevity and stretching!Had I known it was primarily bonded I would have chosen something else."
0,I'll pass,"This magazine clearly caters exclusively to the mainstream American parent. As a mother who breastfeeds, cloth diapers, and co-sleeps I find that this publication has very little to offer parents who parent 'outside of the box'. Furthermore, I often come across opinions presented as facts, and studies are often grossly misquoted and misinterpreted. Coming from a scientific background, I find the information presented in this magazine to be skewed and biased and showing a distinct lack of research to back up its claims.I also miss articles on breastfeeding, choices in diapering, etc. The focus is clearly on consumerism (baby products and ads), and there is hardly any critical reflection and not enough information.I'll pass on this one."
0,"Yuck - dull, uninspired","Now I remember why I didn't fret when I lost the LP version of this disk. Renaissance has made terrific music, but this outing isn't among their better efforts. Everyone sounds out of energy and there's no overarching theme or unity of direction to tie things together. Check out the band's other fine disks."
1,This book represents a clear common sense approach to sales!,"I have sent many copies of this book to associates, most of whom never really understood what drove REAL salespeople to succeed. I highly recommend this for new salespeople or staff that have to interact with salespeople. It's real grass roots motivation!"
1,a mass for relaxation of your mind.,"imagine yourself sitting in a cafe. the sea is widley spread in front of your eyes and you hear this c.d . . . from the greatest chill out d.j. loacated in ibiza comes a new master piece which continues his line from the ""cafe del mar"" compilations. the c.d starts with an ambient theme which implies the variable content of what to come. even if you dont know this talented artist just buy the c.d to hear ""blues for ibiza"" - the modern version to a groovy ""betty-blue"". continue with some ""bossa nova"" and dont forget to hear the relaxing chill out in the ""train to nottingham"". a rare c.d which contains all sorts of music from australlian to arabic music from progressive to trance and more . . . enjoy yourself !"
1,Excellent,"Utada's album Exodus is another tribute to her talent! She create a unique and new sound, blending beautiful melody and tight beats. Her lyrics show a different side of her that adds a new dimension to her style and personality. To all you Utada fans: this is a must add to your collection! And to everyone else: if your tired of the same-old, same-old and is looking for fresh and unique sound, look no further!!!"
1,Great product for the price!,"This stand is well constructed, and gives your superior protection with the foam padding. I also like the rubber strap across the top. I didn't have any issue with smell like other reviews. I did have a small piece of plastic break off on the center post where it telescopes, but not really a issue since it doesn't touch the guitar. Solid stand for the price, and no worries about any scuff marks appearing on your guitar."
1,Korean mink blanket,"It is a beautiful blanket, but not quite what I bought in Korea. It is single layered and not for a king size bed. The wife likes it so I guess it stays. It really is a beautiful blanket."
1,Thorlo socks ROCK!!,Not much else to say but these are the best socks out there. I use them in my steeltoe work boots that I wear 8 hours a day on concrete and they keep my feel feeling great and free of pain. I will buy more in the future.
0,"Very Superficial, Dated and Basically worthless","Did you really think Allen Dulles would give us the beef ? This book is akin to a joke as far as content goes and I really think it is meant to hold coffee tables down rather than be read. Revelations such as ""Most countries have 2 intelligence services rather than 1"" and foreign hotel rooms reserved for dignitaries are usually bugged in the Soviet Union are shocking deep revelations typical of this poor excuse of a book. Buy it used if you must or better yet, peruse it at a library first and you will see it is worthless."
0,"deceptive title, read description VERY carefully!","READ THE DESCRIPTION CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU BUY because the way the seller has described this item as a 3.5 to 2.5 adapter is deceptive. the description further states that it has a 2.5 female and a 3.5 male, which in my experience is actually a 2.5 to 3.5 adapter.if you have headphones with a 3.5mm jack and want to be able to plug those headphones into electronics with 2.5mm port, this is NOT the product for you. this will take your headphones with a 2.5mm jack and allow you to plug them into electronics with a 3.5mm port.thank goodness it was cheap, because it's totally worthless to me."
1,"Hold back the night, top notch","Written during the Korean War, this fictious novel about a USMC Weapons Company, Is a good read. Its characters are ""real"", and the mission, although a little farfetched, is reasonable. With flashbacks to give background and character to the players,the sense of realizm, based loosely on the famed USMC march to the sea, in November of 1950, leaves you with a real sense of what must have been like in the bitter, frozen days of dispair during the Chinese Intervention."
0,Just Plain Awful,"The first and second Robocop films were great. I loved the over-the-top action and humor elements in both films.Robocop 3 is a pure, unadulterated disaster. First off, it is way too tame (a PG-13 rating??!!). Second, the ""plot"" is completely ruined by the introduction of the ""cute little kid who is a computer whiz"" character, what a travesty! Third, the movie is actually boring; a boring Robocop movie! I could go on and on, but why bother.They dare to put this garbage on DVD?"
0,Fluff,"Much ado about nothing!-- just a lot of fluff and filler and general rambling about family life. From my standpoint (and I am an aunt seven times), there wasn't anything in this book to recommend having bought it. I feel that I wasted my money."
1,Fantastic Fikm,"i`ve been watching the film every Easter,for quite a while now: This is A great addition to my DVD library"
0,Why you should just buy the Trilogy,"If Star Wars fans go ahead and buy these individual DVD's of Star Wars:IV-VI, which include the Laserdisc transfer versions of the original theatrical releases, they'll be sending the message to Mr. Lucas that fans don't care about the quality of the presentation of these films. Lucasfilm includes a THX demo on DVD's of their movies to help perfect how the movie is viewed, supposedly because they are committed to quality. Yet with these original theatrical releases, they've been created using the 1993 Laserdisc transfer! Boycott these inferior releases and wait for Lucasfilm to offer us a high-quality, THX certified, product."
0,Narration on sound recording almost as bad as the writing.,"I think if I had read this book instead of listening to it, the children would not as come off as petulant little brats. The narrator was over the top, making Sara so very saintly and Mack as nasty as Snidely Whiplash. The only interesting characters were the Corcorans. The plot was flimsy and as many reviewers pointed out there were many holes and unanswered questions. For instance: Do not the authors know that there are more than one airports in New York? So if one is shut down for security reasons, Sara and Ruben could have flown out of another one, or flown out of DC?To those who did not finish the book, you did not miss much. The last part was mostly filler consisting of preaching. It was like they had to meet their word limit and just didn't want to make the effort to wrap up loose ends, like what happened to Mack.This is the first Judith Michael book I've read and I don't think I'll take a chance on another one."
0,"Not ""Advanced""","There is very little ""advanced"" material in this book. This book contains lots of useful intro material for beginners and some moderately advanced material for those progressing out of the beginner stage. Be forewarned, however...half the book is composed of useless filler - a hierarchical dump of all of the classes in several different dialects. This was obvioulsy put in to bulk the book up by a few hundred pages and a couple of pounds."
0,A Traitor to Memory,"I have read all of elizabeth george's mysteries and looked forward with anticipation to this one. Her writing as always is riveting and her book is hard to put down. This book is over 700 pages. The time line takes a while to understand and get used to; eventually it is understandable. BUT; after 700 pages all of the loose ends in the plot should answered. Two of the hit and run attacks are never clearly explained, and the timing of the first seems to have occured too soon to make sense. The reason for Eugenia Davis being sent to the address of her hit and run is also never explained. 700 pages is too long for this good a writer to have this many inconsistencies. And, my God, what does the ending mean?"
1,A Must Buy Game,"Jet Force Gemini is an exciting, action packed thrill ride with lots of cool weapons and easy controls. The levels aren't that hard to beat, but you need to know how to use your weapons effectively or else you're toast. The Multiplayer feature isn't too great when you first get the game, but once you unlock a few secret levels and characters it gets more interesting. This is definetly a must have game for all of you gamers out there that liked Shadows of the Empire for 64."
1,This is Kitaro!,"Silk Road 2 is a beautiful piece of music, and again Kitaro shows himself to be a master in painting a picture with music. The ten pieces on this disk are exquisitely done and can, if you let them, transport you to another place and time. This is an excellent sequel to Silk Road 1, and I highly recommend it."
1,Highway robbery!!,"For the love of god, do NOT buy the Star Trek Action Pack or half the games within from the scammers here on Amazon. I bought this lovely pack in a Wal-Mart for $40 back in 2003! Do not be taken in by these greedy fools here trying to sell you 4 [..] games, which are all [...] if not more and definitely not worth a new game's price or more. You can buy them all separately at any retailer for significantly less than this single pack would cost. Shame on all of you resellers ripping people off to the extreme!"
1,Very pleased!,Lovely color and excellent quality. They arrived very soon after I ordered them and no s/ h costs. A great bargain. Also ordered and recieved the light blue ones. Very pleased.
0,Doesn't work,Can't play on anything but a laptop! Would rather keep my money than have a DVD that doesn't work! The only thing that I could use to play the DVD was my computer and who wants to watch a movie on a computer. Not me no thanks!
1,Great price and reliable performance,The shuffler works like a champ with 4-6 decks. The batteries also seem to hold up very well as we play a few times a week and its been almost two months since I bought it. Only one small complaint is that it is really loud while shuffling. Excellent product and performance for the price.
0,Mt Great-Great Uncle,"I only bought this because my Great-great uncle, Ross Santee, was featured in it for about 15 seconds. The video was made in 1939, when color had just come out, and the quality of the color is awful. Shadows in people's faces are green. The story line is so basic any kid could predict the ending. Still, it was well worth $10 for me to have a tiny bit of memorabilia of my long-distant family member."
0,Borrow this one from the library,"Did I skip a chapter? I have read several books on getting my baby to sleep through the night, & I'm still looking for the answer. I even had my mom stay with him for a week to comfort him through the nights (she really IS a baby whisperer) yet he still wakes up on schedule- 3 hours- for his feeding. After learning his cues, I know he's definetly hungry. I don't feel Tracy addressed the real issues that my friends and I have, instead, covered topics like nursing too long (an hour) or trying to put him down with loud music. Duh! She doesn't come right out and say it, but I believe she must let the babies cry it out as long as there obvious needs are met. To her credit, she was entertaining & had several ideas worth reading, such as her chapter on body language and cues. I loved her advice to treat your baby like a little human being. My son was already on her EASY schedule after reading 'Babywise'. Tracy, come to my house and see if you can whisper my son to sleep."
1,It's wonderful!,"I had a Cuisinart before this (albeit an older one). This design is much better in several ways. The little bowl is big enough for most chopping jobs, so all you have to wash is the little bowl, the blade and the top -- much less dishwasher space than the one bowl kind. I had a little chopper and a 9 cup(?) before. The chopper was too small for most things and the 9c. was too big. The little bowl fits the bill very well for most jobs as I said. Second, the fact that you can have the machine running, and yet safely put in all different sizes of ingredients (as opposed to the top being interlocked) is really great. Much more flexible design. Third, the fittings come in a nice little box, with all the ones in there I'd really ever use. So safely stored, and conveniently accessed. Last, the bowls are thicker, so I suspect less likely to crack and craze than the old ones. So I recommend this product very enthusiastically."
0,"Whatever Happened to ""James Patterson?""","I loved the past mysteries of James Patterson when he was not paired with another writer, an unknown one at that. I never failed to read his work, but now that he's churning out several books a year, in comparison to other authors who take a year or two to complete a novel, I have to wonder if the storytelling is secondary to making money. Sorry, but I want the ""old"" James Patterson style to come back."
0,Pick a different printer,"Have now worked with two Kodak printer docs, wanting to be able to just drop my Kodak camera on top to connect to PC or print directly. And now two printer docs have soon stopped picking up paper. Sometimes I can manually feed a sheet around the cartridge, but how convenient is that? You can read other with the same experiences, and worse. Pick another printer besides the Kodak."
1,Heavy-duty lounger made to last!,"We've recently bought several pool floats and toys to enjoy our first summer with a pool! This Day Dreamer Lounger is the best product we've bought so far. The air has held wayyyyy better than anything we've bought so far. The plastic that is used to make this product is also much thicker and abrasion-resistant than anything we've got. The material used to make this is clearly and visibly stronger than most pool floats.Since purchasing other items, in the future we will be looking for floats and toys with a heavy-duty plastic. We bought one 72"" float/raft and it feels like you could tear the raft in two with your hands its so thin. We've patched it twice already.Again, no one should worry over purchasing this Day Dreamer."
0,A terrible Miss-assesment,"In 1898 Mr Soros would have predicted a `bubble' and he would have predicted the same `bubble' in 1945 and he would have been wrong both times just like he is now. Mr. Soros whose home country of Czecheslovakia was twice saved by America, first from the Nazis and then the Communists, is now whining about American power in this weak account. This book assaults America and the `bush doctrine' and the criticism is `how dare America defend itself against terrorism'. This false account attacks American policy of confronting terror because secretly this book is pro terror. Its pathetic how someone can write a book attacking the very country whose liberal economic policies allowed them to a massive fortune. Had Mr. Soros grown up in Saudi or Communist Russia he would still be a penniless peasant but he is now using the very money American capitalism allowed him to speculate on to attack the hand that feeds. A terrible miss-assessment."
0,Corgiville Christmas book review,I wish the book preview function had been available for this book before I bought it because I wouldn't have bought it. My daughter has a Corgi and I thought this would be a cute book for her to have. The illustrations in this copy are quite poor in quality - very grainy and hard to see. From the reviews I thought they would be spectacular. Maybe I got a bad copy? Who knows? We were quite disappointed!
1,"Good Tarp, Lighter than Canvas, Will Last Longer!","No product gets 5 stars, as nothing is perfect. However, this tarp is a great buy at the cost, as it is both lighter than canvas, and made of a more durable material, and will last you a good while, if taken care of properly.I grew up with nothing but canvas tarps, and they last to this day (I'm 24), but are riddled with gaping holes, that make them virtual useless for what I needed this tarp for--setting my tent on top of it to protect the tent's bottom from the wet ground.The grommets do not feel cheapily made, but I can't comment on their functionality, as I don't use them.Overall, it's a great size, and a great value for the money. Shipping is a bit rough, but the product is rather heavy. I received my item surprisingly quick, as I am in Missouri, and this shipped from Oregon."
1,These work great,"Ignore the complaining guy. He didn't bother to read the instructions, which make it clear that you're supposed to twist the clips after installing these. They don't fall off if you do it right. The guy who say he'll use ""the string version"" is apparently trying to use these on a lantern they're not designed for, since these tube mantles only come with the Insta-clip, you can't get them in a string tie version. Most people wouldn't have these problems.Lanterns which use these mantles put out more light than the traditional ones, because the mantles have more area. These aren't any more fragile than the traditional mantles. Although they're larger, they're also supported at both ends instead of just hanging."
0,Pressure opened it,It came to me already opened. I toss it in the garbage. I won't be buying these kind of products online.
1,Crime DOES pay...,"...at least in terms of entertainment. This movie about a group of inept French criminals sent to the United States on a job, find themselves caught up in multiple double-crosses and under fire from the Chicago Mafia. The French crew, led by Gerard Depardieu, are a motley crew but, as it turns out, a likeable bunch. Harvey Keitel shows his great skill as an actor in his ability to make his character both menacing and yet subtly funny which makes the whole movie even more enjoyable. A great ensemble cast for a movie!"
1,Excellent Book,"Michael Santos is a very talented writer. His descriptions of prison incidents grip the attention with their powerful realism. It is bizarre how a pedofile who rapes and murders little children can be out of prison after 7 or 8 years while this man, who never hurt anyone but merely provided the means for people to shoot up, is sentenced to 45 years. My only criticism of the book is the fact that he never describes the occasions when he himself was a target of rape and how he dealt with it. An excellent book - buy it!"
1,BEST FUNDAMENTAL OUTLOOK ON SUBCONSCIOUS MIND OUT THERE,"I would recommend this book TO EVERYONE IN THE WORLD... Even if you have no idea what this book is about- BUY IT NOW!!!I've read several on the subject and while this is a very basic outlook that doesn't go too far in-depth, it is still very informative.If you are the person who needs scientific evidence in order to believe anything, THIS IS NOT THE BOOK FOR YOU!If the above statement applies to you, I would suggest ""The Cat in the Hat"""
1,Comfy and supportive,"I like the cushion these have along with the rigid support. I had some heel pain at work in my boots where I walk a few miles each day. After putting in the Powerstep originals my pain lessened and my stride seemed quicker and very natural. The natural feeling is important since it means my body mechanics are aligned. That is a problem I had with some other insoles, but they are an individual fit. You also need to get the correct size so the arch of the insole fits into your arch. I like these better than the Pinnacle. The Sof Sole Airr and Sole DK brand were nice too."
1,Great Journey for the Reader and the Characters,"I was wandering around a secondhand bookstore struggling to find something interesting to read. Somehow I just picked up the Skull Mantra and as sometimes happens a random book can be a treat. And this certainly was. The thing that sticks in my mind was the chance to be taken on a journey somewhere completely new and unfamiliar to me.I found this story to be a great education and also very entertaining. Tibet, Buddhism and the Chinese regime are indeed interesting subjects and all invoking different and personal emotions. The characters seemed so real and although a few times I did get a little lost (probably my fault, not the authors) it all came together and I was not quite ready for it to end. I am off now to get the next book..."
1,Followed here career from my teenage years,Olivia has been a fan of my for at least 20 years. She is very talented and I love to hear her accent when she sings. I have all of her albums tapes and cd's. She is very popular and I like the fact that she cares enough about the planet to speak out for it.
0,"Why is there no ""ZERO"" star category?","What a rip off. The recipes in this book seem like they were ripped right out of the pages of Ladies Home Journal. And what's up ladies? Is that what happened? I mean, you can get better, simpler, tastier recipes than this online without having to buy the book. As for the rest of the stuff that the book says, I agree with other reviewers that there is nothing new here. Nothing at all. It's as though it were written by someone taking a writing class for the first time. ""Okay class, we are going to write about what's in our refrigerator. I'm going to need your composition to be 1000 words and you're going to talk about what might be in a refrigerator if you were trying to eat more healthy foods."" It's blather. If one needs something like this to be healthier, they have many other issues that should be addressed first."

1,Gohan Shines,"This DBZ movie is good but it isn't as long as the standard being over 45 minutes just, its great although its mainly about Gohan so if u dont like him its not worth it. It is one of the greatest and beats 10 and the android movie without difficulty so if u like those this is an almost dead cert as the ending comes just as u really get into it"
1,Chiltons Auto Repair Manual-Ford Explorer,I have used Chilton manuals for many years and have found them to have excellent coverage of their subject. This one is no exception.

0,You left out some of the best songs!,"Unfortunately, I was looking forward to purchasing the ""Something's Gotta Give"" soundtrack until I looked at the track listings and saw that you left out two very important songs: ""Butterfly"" by Crazytown and Maroon 5. The cd would have been so much better with these two songs on it!"
0,"Better than Big Bad Wolf, but that's not saying much.-","********Warning, some mild spoilers********It's absolutely amazing that Patterson wrote off the entirety of Big Bad Wolf in one sentence. And the fact that the plot of this ""sequel"" is so completely unrelated to the previous book that it's laughable. He even pulled in elements from even EARLIER books almost like he couldn't find a way (or was too lazy) to tie up the loose ends in another book. He seems to be on cruise control and not taking much time to write these.The pacing of this book is at a fever pitch......that is until the last 80 pages or so. Once Alex comes back from Paris, it seems almost laid back, and everything is dropped in Alex's lap once again.Since there are no loose ends, this IS my final Patterson book."
1,Insightful parenting,"I love this book. Dr. Sears is not soft on discipline at all, but explains a discipline philosophy that keeps parents in charge and kids happy."
0,Tension Problems,"I too bought the Brother and had tension problems. I returned it for the cheapest computerized Janome I could find. I got the 8050 from Hancock Fabrics (same as the DC1050). I LOVE LOVE LOVE my Janome. I have had it for about two months. I use it nearly every day. I've done quilting, denim, and knits and have not had a single problem with it tension-wise. It's easy to set up and works like a dream! The only downside is that it is hard to find accessories, as the Brother and Singer class 15 bobbins that are sold at Walmart and JoAnns do not work on the Janome. It does not come with nearly as many feet as the Brother. The Brother would be a great deal if it worked. I guess you get what you pay for."
1,nooice!,"this is a heck of a watch for the money I spent more for much less at wallmart couple years back.I will never use all the features but as a simple chronometer it is well worth the cost, I have to say the thermometer is goofy at best.I will research it and try to make it actually work otherwise I might take off another point as a working thermometer would be handy."
0,Looks like a amature collection of below basic porn.,"The entire video has stuff that is sexual but no more than a sexual joke you might tell, and others are cartoons to watch while you're stoned and need stimulus (And I'm being generous with the word stimulus). This a waste of your money if you are all but sex therapists or animation collectors for its age and lack of creativity."
1,Warms your heart and amuses too,"I first started reading this book when my twins (now 19) were babies. I now buy a new copy each year to read when the local school district's Volunteers in Public Schools organization has a reading day. I read it to a class of 1st to 4th graders and then donate it to the school's library. In many years of doing this, the book has never failed to get a great response from the kids. The story of a smart, plucky young girl and how she gets the best of a series of nasties is an excelllent role model for the kids. The illustrations are rich and amusing. Fabulous."
0,Read Description Carefully,"Garmin 010-10723-02 Carrying Case For NuviThis is a well-made case for the navigation unit ONLY. While it fits well and offers obvious protection for the touchscreen, I still have to carry the windshield mounting eqipment separately when I travel. A slightly larger case that had room for the entire setup would have been a much better choice."
1,The Best Thoughts on Church Planting in One Place,"I have probably read every book on church planting that's out there and I can say that without a doubt this is the best single reference in print today. There's just no substitute for learning from someone that is actually in the field doing it. Ron Sylvia has done a great service to all church planters by sharing what he has learned over the years with those that are just starting out now. If you are a church planter, or are considering it, get this book NOW and have Amazon overnight it!"
1,Good product in overall,"I have a low threshold for pain and was able to tolerate this OK from the very first time. It gets easier the more you do it, though. The issues I found with this product is that you may have to do this many times in the same area to completely remove hair and also the number of ingrown hairs that result after using it. Also, I was only able to use it on my legs as other areas prooved to be very painful."
1,Cool Yule Definitely Cool,"Bette strikes again. This is definitely different. Bette does so much up-tempo in her other work, yet here are many ballads. I particularly like that these familiar songs are full song renditions, verse included, unlike so many Christmas cds where only the chorus is sung to get more titles on the disc. And her home state Mele Kamikimaka rendition is terrific."
1,Compression Gloves for Arthritis by EasyComforts SM,Excellent item Easy to use and definely helps whenever hands ache.Have osteoarthritis and the support and warmth from this item helps.

1,"GODDESS, HOW I LOVED THIS ONE!","Reading this caused a resurgence of memories. I revisited my childhood, adolescence, young adulthood, recalling feelings, sensations, looks, stolen glances, yearnings, achings--and all, at the time, without knowledge of my being Lesbian. Oh, what a pleasant ride I shared with all the contributors of the book. I laughed, cried and sought more and more revelation. I questioned myself and my spouse,about our past, present and future selves.Today, I relive my early embraces! Thanks, Lindsey Elder, for the ride!"
1,Perfectly Snug,"I am very satisfied with the fit and quality of this case. I have an Exilim EX-Z50. What I don't like is the relatively large pocket in front that makes it extra wide and adds too much bulk. A little unnecessary, I think. But other than that, good case."
1,Exploding Bahaus Myths,"This is a brilliantly written book focussing on the often overlooked question of how the women accepted into Bahaus developed professionally, and the limitations that were placed upon them, despite the ostensible ""equality"" that Bahaus proposed. There are copious black and white photographic reproductions of the textile work developed both during study, and during subsequent careers. I would recommend this book for anyone interested in textile design, and it is really required reading for anyone who wants to round out their knowledge of the institution. However, it's not a pretty picture book of textiles - better quality images would have made it 5 stars for me."
0,"HORRIBLE recipes, unrealistic expectations!","Yes, it is completely true what the other reviewers have pointed out - this book has RIDICULOUS standards that no human being could possibly live up to. When I first purchased this book (luckily second-hand so I didn't pay full price) I was very excited about having a wealth of knowledge and recipes at my fingertips. But as soon as I started reading it, it just made me feel so guilty and horrible about everything I ate before I knew I was pregnant, and also what I was expected to do now that I know. Talk about ruining the experience! I even tried some of the recipes in the book - the veggie soup was bogus and ""FUDGE BROWNIES""??? Give me a break, those were the most disgusting things I have ever tried to eat. They were not chocolately in the least but rather tasted like some kind of fig bars. Just listen to your body and your doctor's advice and skip this piece of trash!"
1,Wow photos,"Just take a look at the cover. The book is full of photos like that one. Photos that I look at and think ""wow"". The author explains how he took the photos, concentrating on where he measured the light.For my taste he concentrates too much on external meters, though. Personally I do not have one and do not intend to carry even more equipment around with me..."

0,"No new information, not complete","This book pales in comparison to Learning Perl and Programming Perl, which are both essential books to read before you can even attempt to understand the examples in CGI Programming.The essential information contained can easily be discovered on countless internet tutorials, and with more depth. CGI Programming only skims over each topic, never going in to much depth, and the topics that it covers are much too varied and vast.I own this book but rarely use it. By the time you have read Learning Perl and/or Programming Perl, you will find CGI Programming obsolete."

0,For Camcorders,I wanted a step down ring for my 35 mm 24-120 Nikon lens. I did a Google search and this one came up.You cannot screw this adapter onto your lens. It has no screw-in ring EXCEPT for the 52 mm filter that screws into the middle of this adapter.If you want to use it you must use artist's black masking tape to attach it to your lens. This ring creates a huge vignette which is why I bought it. Not worth sending back but not a cheap lesson either.Product information and picture is deceiving.

1,"Schoenberg in a festive, lush, and mostly accessible mood","Schoenberg's fearsome reputation with the music-going public is sitll potent enough to clear a concert hall, which is unfortunate for anyone who has missed out hearing his tonal works. The reviewers below have given detailed descriptions of this CD. I only want to add that the Concerto for String Quartet after Handel is a delightful, festive piece, and having just discovered it myself (I heard it as the score to a Paul Taylor ballet, Spindrift), my enthusiasm is sitll fresh. The two vocal works here are nearly as acceissble. In particular, the lush post-romantic idiom of The Book of the Hanging Gardens falls on the ear as seductively as Berg's early songs or Wolf's late ones. Maybe listening to these three pieces will make it easier for listeners to accept the twelve-tone Suite for PIano, which is quite beautifully composed for the instrument, but if not, the more accessible works are a joy in themselves."
0,Plastic Taste,"We tried everything to get rid of the plastic taste. We ran through plain water, coffee, baking soda, vinegar. All told, we ran through at least 40 cups. It still tastes like plastic -- I'm thinking plastic infused water is not good for us also. My husband is taking it back to Costco this morning"
1,Feel the wind.,"A new star and a old star cooperate and get the top.A race scene is very exciting. Especially, driving on a public way is unblievable.Indeed, a story line is poor, but you must be satisfied only with the racing scenes.I think acting is good. You won't be disappointed.Thank you."
1,Classic J&H album,While it is likely that Anthony Warlow will ever play the role of Jekyll again this is certainly a must for every fan!
0,Faulty design,This product failed in less than one year. It appears to be the rechargeable battery and is clearly a design or quality defect. It should be removed from the market.
