0,Anyone who likes this better than the Pekinpah is a moron.,"All the pretty people in this film. Even the Rudy character played by Michael Madsen. This is adapted from a Jim Thompson novel for cryin' out loud! These are supposed to be marginal characters, not fashion models. Though McQueen and McGraw were attractive (but check out McQueen's crummy prison haircut) they were believable in the role. Baldwin and Bassinger seem like movie stars trying to act like hard cases. Action wise, the robbery scene in the Pekinpah version was about 100 times more exciting and suspenseful than anything in this re-make."
0,Author seems mentally unstable,"I know that Tom Robbins has a loyal following and I started the book with high expectations. However, I did not enjoy this book as it was too much work to follow his confused logic. I think that he was under the influence during most of time that he wrote."
1,Spaetzle Noodles,This type of spaetzle maker is easier to manuveur than the old press kind and much easier on the hands. The difference is that this new spaetzle maker makes smaller noodles than the old. It is great for us elderly that don't have much strength left.
1,Cool product until the cats lost it . . . .,"My cats seemed to be amused to work for their food. One cat would roll the ball with her paws and nose, and the other would walk behind her and eat up whatever fell out -- teamwork! I knew they'd dig this ball because I had already made something similar out of a plastic water bottle before that they liked a lot.A few weeks after getting this, though, the ball was never to be found again. I think it may have rolled down into the dark basement at some point and became one with the clutter.+1 for the adjustable hole sizes. -1 for the mess that happens when trying to put the food in by hand (although this could be solved with a funnel)."
1,Works as expected,"I've had no problems running this with my Dell 8200 PC running Windows XP Home Edition which is running an addon USB 2 card, to which this hub (I have the 8 port version) is connected. When I bought it a year ago, I thought that 8 ports would be overkill and that 4 would be adequate, but I bought this unit anyway. Boy was I glad, right now 6 of the 8 are in use."
1,Not a bad deal...,"If you're considering purchasing this movie, I have to figure you're either a huge fan of Sarah Michelle Gellar, or you've seen the movie in the past and really liked it. Either that, or you're like me and you bought it as a gift for someone else, lol (although I did see this in the theater years ago and liked it). So there's not much use in reviewing the movie itself.As for the DVD release...you're not going to get anything in the way of extras (correct me if I'm wrong, but I think there's only a trailer)...but you do get the movie in both widescreen as well as pan and scan. It's of good quality, and it came at a good price (at least it did when I purchased it, lol)."
1,Nice extras on the 300 DVD,"Good picture on blu-ray, but I don't know if it would be much different on DVD since the lighting in the movie is pretty dark."
0,Too Mellow for Me,"I've always been a John Mellencamp fan (all the way back to Jack and Diane). It's been a while since I've bought one of his albums, but I bought this one on a whim. I should have read some reviews first. I'm very disappointed. Cuttin' Heads and Peaceful World are ok songs, but there isn't a standout in the bunch. Too many of them are too mellow. Pass on this album if you like the older stuff."
1,just what I needed,I need t's like this to get through my days at the barn with the horses! They're great and thanks for the quick shipping.
1,nasty,"In 1880s Australia, a lawman makes a deal with a bandit to bring his murderous brother to justice. Simple story about the brutality of frontier life has direction, cinematography and characters reminiscent of the best 60s spaghetti westerns such as ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" (1969). Viewers may also enjoy the similar-styled ""The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada"" (2005) and ""No Country for Old Men"" (2007)."
1,"Yeah it's pricey, but it's pretty funny...","OK, if you aren't a die-hard Family Guy fan, if you don't like the jokes that go on for a little TOO long or the jokes that normally start with ""like that one time when Peter..."" this isn't for you...That aside, if you like all the side gags on family guy where they trail off to something that is completely off subject, this IS for you. To me, this disc is filled with the things Seth couldn't find space for in a Family Guy episode or that the FCC would have a stroke over if they did. I absolutely love Family Guy and the fact that they don't care too much about being politically correct...it's refreshing and this disc stays true to that. It's raunchy, just wrong sometimes, and pretty hilarious all at the same time.I didn't give it 5 stars because it's a little pricey for only an hour's worth of fun. Enjoy!"
0,Not worth the money,"I'd give it a 0 if I could.I bought this toy last night after a customer in the store gave it great reviews. This toy is totally ridiculous. My 10 month old loves elmo. He has all of the other elmo dolls (hokey pokey, ymca, chicken dance, tickle me, rock n' roll, even the build a bear elmo) and a hand puppet and loves these. He looked at the tmx like it was having a seizure. He actually crawled away from it and didn't give it a second look. My six year old played with it for maybe a minute and then said ""Does it do anything else?"" Unfortunately, it doesn't. Maybe if it would talk or sing a song it would be better. But you can hardly understand what he is saying and it just isn't entertaining.Buy something better with your $40.00"
0,You get waht you pay for...,"I've had mine for just over 6 months, and it crapped out. My Heier lasted 6 years, and I wish I would have spent the extra money to buy one."
0,"Sensible, average, but not innovative.","I'm pleased I bought this book. It provides a sensible and fairly exhaustive overview of the rise of the Nazis. But I'm also disappointed. The book contains nothing unique or original. In terms of fact and interpretation it is safe and conforming, and devoid of originality.Perhaps my standards are unrealistic, or maybe my expectation of a book by Professor Evans, a distinguished academic at Cambridge University, was too high. Either way I don't rate this book as a lofty contribution. It lacks the penetrating analytical touch of Michael Burleigh's similar but better work, and as the first work of a trilogy does not inspire me to think about buying the next two volumes."
1,A great comfortable pump.,"This is a wonderfully comfortable and good looking pump especially if you're looking for a slightly wider toe box. It looks great with a skirt or slacks. My only complaint is that after finally accepting that a wide width is the most comfortable, and kindest to my feet, I can't find my size (6.5 W) in navy. I have the shoe in black. If anyone from Naturalizer is reading this message; how about making more sizes and colors in wide widths available?"
0,way overated,this band is one long joke.aside from three songs this is spinal taps warm up band.i can't believe all the love they get.
0,Player is flawed and Digitalway does not support,"I was given the FL100 as a gift and soon realized the product is flawed. If the player is connected to the PC and the battery dies, it will corrupt the internal memory and the player will not restart after replacing the battery. The player BIOS will initiate, however, once the internal memory check is complete the message ""Battery Low !!!"" will appear and it shuts down. The internal memory can be re-formatted but the player must be on to do so. I contacted Digitalway regarding this and they said, ""If the player purchase date is less than 30 days old and you have the receipt, you may return it to the place of purchase. If the player purchase date is more than 30 days and less than 120 days old and you have the receipt, you may return it to Digitalway."" The key here is receipt. I also believe they are not really backing this product. I would recommend looking at comparable players and especially the warranty."
0,Religious Tone,"I did not think that this book added a great deal of real information that wasn't just common sense. Also, parts of it reminded me of a religious sermon. This seemed to be out of place and totally unexpected. The book was not what I expected. This book is great for the religious right, not the general public."
0,As Muddy As the Whangpu,"Alas, despite the enticing title and initially engaging, gossipy style, this book bogs down in repetitive trivial details while failing to explore fasciniting topics to which it alludes (such as the international drug trade in the early 20th century and its links to Shanghai and to international arms trading after WWI). Little effort is made to identify individuals as they reappear in subsequent chapters or to present a coherent historical narrative. This is one of the very few books I have ever simply chosen to put down rather than finish."
1,The Outsiders,"The book called The Outsiders was written by a 16 year old girl named S.E. Hinton. It takes place in Oklahoma. The main Greasers are Ponyboy, Dally, Sodapop,Darry, Johnnyboy,and the least ones are Two-bit and Steve. Ponyboy,Darry,and Sodapop are all brothers. They lost there parents in a car accident.Ponyboy,the youngest, and Johnnyboy , who is 16,get in some trouble with the Socs. The Socs are Cherry, Bob, Randy and Marcia. In the book one of the guys dies... but you have the read the book on your own.The lesson in the book, I thought, was that everyone has a rough life. All age groups do and also their classes. This book would be good for ages 11-16. I think this because thats when it starts to get hard for the kids.I like the book over all. The book was kinda slow at first. I liked the book beacause what you learn from it. It has a lot of emotion. I would recomend this book to anyone."
1,Global Groove Mask,"This CD has a great pulsating driving rhythm. The different musical sensations can bring the emotional force to its explosive peek, it isnt your regular ""bump and grind."" Put this one in your CD player and get into the Global Groove. Loved it. THIS ONE IS A MUST ! ! ! ! Take the mask off and let the rhythm move you........."
1,Great book but lesser in the series,"All of the Shopaholic books are great but this one was not as good as the others. Don't get me wrong it is still worth reading and leaves the impression that there is more to come but it simply does not compare to the first three books.Becky is even more out of control than ever in this installment of the series, when she meets her long lost half sister, who happens to HATE shopping. Becky with her overwhelming desire to be the best sister ever (because she was always an only child) tries so hard to get her new sister (who happens to be everything Becky is not) to be her best friend. The usual hilarity that comes with Becky insues and Kinsella once again provides her reader with great fun and laughs.Ending gives the impression that there is more of Becky's life to come... can't wait for another book in this great series."
0,Bad re-edit of a fun film,For some reason when it was released in the US this year they decided to edit out most of the comedic scenes and most anything not directly involving Jackie Chan from the earlier release. They also almost totally replaced the soundtrack with music that for the most part didn't match the scene. I like Jackie Chan films but this release was very disapointing. The only up side was that the voices were re-dubbed by I think by the original actors. The action is still good but the older versions of the film are better.
1,A greate book for beginners,"This book has a lot of general information about Tanganyikan cichlids and the way to keep them in a home aquarium. The pictures in the book have a special glossy cover, which makes them look very good. It's an excellent 'first book', but someone interested in information about specific cichlid should search for them in another book."
1,Sennheiser Headphones,The unit works well and has a nice long cord and was a good value. The ear pads are a bit small.
0,Worst DVD Player I have ever owned!,"This DVD Player looked good online and the reviews at the time were not that bad so I purchased it; however, I can tell you that this is the worst item I have purchased online! This system does not allow you to fast forward/rewind; it only lets you jump from scene to scene. It was manufactured very cheaply; its remote control is a joke. I am so disappointed!"
1,Marching to the beat of a different drum,"I posted the book's table of contents - see ""Customer images"" link above - and would like to point out Chapter 4, which discusses ""relational data mining"", also recommending the closely related Chapters 3 and 7. (But not Chapter 2; the authors' mastery of time-series methods - if these do belong to data mining - is not obvious).I am skeptical about applicability of the proposed method, and would consult other books on neural nets or fuzzy logic - or Bayesian belief networks, for example, forgotten here - but others may disagree.Jeers to Kluwer for charging over $100 for a book that really should cost $50-60, yet not hiring a proof-reader. (""Daiwa Secretes""!)"
0,not what I was hoping for,I had sampled this at a store once and absolutely loved it. But the bottle I have smells acidic and chemically and the sent hardly last. Wish I had returned it. :(Too bad I normally love their stuff. The seller was prompt and cool and all that.
1,Absolutely Horrifying,"I first read this book at age 10 and could hardly sleep for 3 days. I have re-read it many times since, and I am glad to report that it is still as frightening to the adult as it was for the child. This book teems with terrifying images and situations which I won't describe so as not to spoil the suspense. This was what scared me as a child. What scares the adult on top of this is the emotional collapse of Jack Torrance and his descent into madness. The relationships in the family triad are brilliantly depicted. This is a novel about the horrors of alcoholism, insanity, and child abuse, which are of course only compounded by the supernatural evil these characters become enmeshed in. This is my favorite King novel and I would really like to know what happened to Danny Torrance when he reached adulthood!"
1,Great Movie,"A must see, great story and great ending, watch this movie!!!! Perfect for a slow Sunday afternoon or a could day when you are snowed in."
1,Great Value,This book was very heart touching and blew every thing I thought I knew about the Holocaust out the water. Great read for mature audience.
0,"This Cd, has absolutely zero point on this earth....","If you are a real house style raver, I suggest you consider buying another CD. I was recommended this CD, and I was disappointed when I heard it....The beats are not innovative at all, and rappers with the same style as Doc Ock, are a dime a dozen. Heed my warning and stay away from this cd at all costs....."
0,Not the OEM Unit that was listed!,The battery I received is not from APC as the picture and the description suggested and I was not able to return it.
1,Good LIve Curtis,"This album is pretty good. Its very energetic and the mix is good. Some excellent effects on ""if there's hell below"" This is the only Curtis live album I have and I like it alot. Some of the Keyboards sound a little lame, but dont let that stop you from enjoying this album. Excellent rythym section"
1,Eats Wood!,"I looked at all the planers. I was going to buy a planer with AMPS being my first concern. With a 3.4 amp motor this planer did not fail once. I put this machine to work on rough cut white oak with the blades full bore, and I got tired before this Hitachi planer. My only wish is the shoe as in all planers in this class was 1 inch longer. With a longer shoe or base this would get 5 stars. At this price you cannot go wrong. Blades are a snap to change, and sharpen. This is a nice machine."
1,yummy choc. milk,Gave this as a gift and she absolutely loved it. Said it was the best choc drink she ever had. Great gift item.
1,Good book - recommended for everyone who manages testing,"I very much liked the book. Rex Black has written about the process and management side of testing. This makes it an ideal complement to Cem Kaner's ""Testing Computer Software"" (which deals with testing technique) and Boris Beizer's ""Software Testing Techniques"" (which deals with the fundamentals).I found the templates useful, mostly because I never worked my way around Excel to get those metrics in an automated manner. But don't expect them to be replacement for commercial test management tools.This should be a required reading for anyone who plans or manages testing."
1,MY FAV BOOK,"This is by far my fav book. It's very Sex in the City set in the 50's. It's very stylized and true to it's era. Plus if you like reading about show business, than this book will be fascinating. It's a easy fluff read, so don't expect it to be A Tale of Two Cities or anything like that!!! It's fun, just look at the cover...It's pink!"
0,"Not impressed, but I still passed","I wanted to post this review, because I must have misunderstood the purpose of these CLEP books. As was indiciated to me today by the testing center, these books are designed to refresh the memories of people who have a good knowledge base of the subject. For individuals such as myself, who haven't taken American History since the early 90's, it didn't prepare me like I expected it to.I studied this book for three months, I had a 95% on each of the practice exams, and I barely passed this CLEP. Passing is passing, I agree, but just keep in mind that this book is a framework. There were so many questions on my exam on topics my clep book didn't touch on. Good thing I like the History channel.Anyway, good refresher, but maybe it's wise to supplement with a cheap high school/college text to be safe."
0,untitled,"I don't want to be harsh. I'm fairly certain that many people put a lot of effort into this book. I just didn't think that it was really a worth the effort though.Essentially the only chapter I found useful was chapter 5. Of course, one chapter doesn't make the book worthwhile though."
1,Beautiful singing!,"I enjoyed this group's previous CD very much, but ""Hoping It Might Be So"" is even better -- the selection of pieces is unusual and the performances are exquisite. ""The Oxen"" is my favorite at the moment, although I also love ""Quem Pastores"" by James Bassi (Why haven't I heard of this composer before? Where have I been?). The choir has a gorgeous sound, and the harp accompaniments are simply lovely. I listen to Christmas music year-round, and I think this CD is going to get a lot of play! I highly recommend ""Hoping It Might Be So"" to anyone who loves fine choral music."
0,Cheap copy,"The disk arrived in a plastic box used for CD's-- not a regular package. The installation directons, printed on the disk itself, state that auto-run will begin when the disk is inserted in the disk drive. Nothing happened and I had to use My Computer and the Setup.exe file to start the installation. About halfway thru the process, it stopped and would not restart. Our son (a computer guy) said the disk is a standard cheap copy type that we can purchase anywhere-- not the usual higher quality that Broderbund would use. Finally we got it installed on the main computer but it would not install on my laptop. I guess it's true-- you get what you pay for. This was cheap enough and that's good. If I have any more problems, I will return it to Amazon."
0,Disappointing considering all the high ratings,Gruen writes like a woman who is trying to sound like a man. Her word choice and syntax did not ring true and unfortunately the method cost her some in credibility. The book was nothing to write home about and certainly did not rank with anything by Erik Larson. The high ratings from other reviewers are puzzling. The reviews about the movie seem to more accurately reflect the quality of the book.
0,Try any other GPS software,"Currently I have over 20 hours in to trying to understand and use this program. I have paid my computer support person over $125. To date I have used the program and found that the route was there but not the map, the map and not the route. I can't find any voice for my Windows mobile device. You are never sure if you are on the right road. I'm so frustrated with this program! I really feel that I have tried to give it a fair chance."
1,Step up to this plate,"For fans of dub as well as jungle and drum & bass, dubstep is a terrific combination of these genres. And for those new to this type of music, The Roots of Dubstep provides a most fitting introduction as it features cuts by many of the better known musicians making dubstep. Personally, I find this kind of music perfect not only for dancing but also for working behind my computer as it is completely energy inducing, without being unduly distracting. So whether you have to write a paper, paint your house or just want to get down and dance, the Roots of Dubstep will give you the necessary step up."
1,Great travel pack,"This bag is nearly perfect. The straps easily tuck away, which is great when using the pack as carryon luggage for a flight or on a train. The front zips open all the way, so you can access the stuff at the bottom of the pack as easily as the stuff on top. The bag isn't huge, which is its greatest strength and weakness. I just spent two months backpacking in India and the bag still looks new."
1,The Diet Cure,This book was so encouraging. The self test to identify my levels made this read a keeper. I experimented with one amino acid for evening carb cravings and just like promised... there were immediate results. I haven't eaten at night out of hunger or comfort for 6 weeks. The biology is simple and the comparison of refined grains lending to addiction with not only food but alcohol was a game changer for me. I have a plan for a year's investment in a quality multivitamin and a list of supplements that make sense and are easily obtainable. I believe I will finally be successful in my journey to become healthy.
0,Very disappointing,"Sorry to say, this movie was a disappointment. Harrison Ford was not at his best, I expected better. He did not make a convincing cowboy. The Indians seemed to be rather lame in the movie. The characters were not well developed at the beginning of the story. A boring movie, the plot was not well done. The only decent part of the movie were the special effects, especially when some of the actors did their own stunts."
0,"As many people in the world I got ""Memory Stick Error"" (C:13:01) on my Sony DSC-W5)","Please be carefull, this is not a lie, lot's of people are having problems whit this memory.""Memory Stick Error"" (C:13:01) on my Sony DSC-W5) rises 1 month after I bought this camera, then suddenly It works again, but I'm expecting to have this problem again. My advice: do not buy it, at least until a new corrected version become available."
0,flimsy,Although there is metal in it; it is extremely flimsy and does not hold discs securely. A total waste of money!
1,This is one of the BEST books I've read.,I have ordered this book for Christmas gifts for at least 15 friends and family members.I'm an avid reader (at least 1-2 books a week) and I usually forget about the books shortly after I've read them. This book is hard to forget. Weeks later I can still recall whole chapters. It has touched my life so much and I want to share it with as many people as possible. I highly recommend this book.One year later - One of the books I gave was to a friend who died unexpectantly. We talked about this book so many times and now I know that she is in her own room of marvels. It has helped me to deal with her loss and to know that I touched her life with this book.
1,"Ask yourself:""Do i feel lucky""","A great game,even though you need to a lot of patience,but I guess that's what makes it great,couse even though you thought you've been to a place you can't expect the same things when you get back there.This game can really make you jump with fright,especially when you are really concentrating.Those zombies jumping up from nowhere.Wow.Don't play it when your'e alone,you'll scare yourself.Graphics is absolutely great.Blowing those zombies to bits is also really cool.Sounds are very realistic and sometimes really scary.You'll love this game no matter what.It's like starring in a great action movie(well except your'e a girl if your'e actually a guy,but a girl that can really kick butt and stand her ground).All I can say is.Coooooool."
0,Awful Movie,"The movie was a big let down, the voice talent and animation is a lot lower quality then the original movies, and songs were horrible.Plus the new girl Porcha is a spoiled rich girl who is mean to Carrie and Amy through most of both movies. I had bought it for my nieces but they started to mimic the movie by calling people goobers so we do not let them watch it any more."
0,In all Honesty,"This game has got great graphics, even better than the previous bond - Goldeneye. (I loved Goldeneye that was a great game) But.....the very detailed graphics have SLOWED DOWN the game. Compaired to goldeneye this game runs VERY SLOW. The controls are also different. The game play in this new bond compaired to the older one (goldeneye) is just terrible.If you have to choose between the new one and goldeneye buy goldeneye. If your looking for an awsome second bond for the nintendo 64 your going to have to wait. Unless you like graphics over game control don't buy this game!"
1,One of the best,"This CD is so good words are hard to come by to describe it. Ricky Van Shelton's voice is perfect for Gospel music and the song choice's on this recording are great. I bought this from Amazon with the hope that because Van Shelton was singing it, that it would be good. I was not disappointed. This CD is great."
1,Not Just Another Rap CD,"I bought this CD because of one song-""What Would You Do"". This is definately the BEST song on the album. The message is sad b/c it talks about a mother who has to work as a prostitute to feed her son, but I absolutely love it. The rest of the album is ok, but What Would You Do is the deepest song on here. As well as ""Sista"". I don't like rap music that much but City High is different."
0,Hmmm when is the full saga coming George !!,"It's alaways the same, we,ve been waiting years for this to come out and when it does you think to yourself, shall i buy it..I have decided not to, not because i'm not a fan of Star Wars, it's because i'm fed up with, all the film companies releasing colections only to replace them with another special edition anniversary etc etc edition.I know that Mr Lucas is going to put all 6 films in one super collection and when he does you can be sure thats the one I will buy, so people stand up to these people who keep bringing out different and better versions lets just keep it sensible.P.S Bet the collection is in time for Christmas LOL !!!"
0,"Without Owen Wilson, There Would Be One Star","If you choose to rent and watch this, rent a hammer as well. First, smash the DVD of this to oblivion and then whack yourself on your bean several times for being such a knob. Dumbness, lameness, lousy acting mixed with a lousy plot and marginal purpose to OK computer generated action sequences. Whap yourself again if you ever think of this terrible movie again. The good stuff of this movie would make a total of an amusing four minute YouTube video with cowboy Owen Wilson and the Roman general bickering. That is it. Don't make me break out my own hammer... Move on. Bad, bad, bad movie."
0,Disappointing wix filter,The filter had less pleats(18) compared to my old Fram air filter(30). More pleats means more surface area for filtering the air. The rubber around the edges were loose and didn't form a proper seal.
0,Bad quality USB speakerphone,This is a USB speakerphone of the worst quality I've ever seen. The sound quality is bad. My partner can hardly hear what I said. It is not the loudness but the echo. I will not recommend this speakerphone to anyone.
1,lots o fun,"This Game is lots of fun. I bought it to play with my family over the X-mass holiday. The only down side is that the cards don't say what they do on them, you have to look them up in the book which comes with the game. This makes for slow game play at first. However, there are 2 different versions of this game available, and the collectors edition has printed what the cards do right on the cards, plus the art work on the cards is much nicer. I highly recommend getting the collectors edition, it's worth the extra couple of bucks."
0,funny indeed,"Wrote Joe Nye : ""Alexa led me to the bed in the middle of the enormous room and pulled me down beside her. I kissed her breasts and ran my hand between her thighs. She gripped my shoulders tightly. Unlike the first time I made love to Alexa, when the ecstasy had been eroded by a sense of anxiety and uncertainty, I was sucked into this moment as quickly and completely as if I had placed my feet in quicksand. Memories from years ago blended with intense physical excitement in a driving, pounding torrent of passion.""Ridicule does not kill, but it can definitely lighten up your day!"
0,Are you kidding me?,"This movie was abysmal. I don't understand how anyone could possibly rate it over two stars. The acting was ridiculous, it is amazing that Robert Duvall lent his name to the film. The cinematography was terrible. The plot also seemed thoughtless, although, having not read the book, I cannot attest to its faithfulness. It seemed as though the producers spent the movie's entire budget on payroll, as the props, writing, etc. were all very shabby. Overall, it is hard to even watch the movie all the way through."
1,Healing The Wounded emotions,Good all round book for the doctor or counsellor looking at non pharmacological means to tacklean immense problem in society today.Also some key spiritual truths as emotions are intimatelylinked to the human spirit.
1,The Heart of All Youngs Music,"This has to be the Neil Young album to savour. Known as on of the ""roughest"" of all youngs albums, with that said, this is the best by far of Youngs early recordings. Songs such as L.A., and Last Dance, will leave you loving this rare gem. This is the cornerstone of all Youngs collection, left for you to love over and over again!!!! You aren't a Young fan until you have heard or loved this album."
0,Dumbest game in THE WORLD!!!!!! :-(,"This is the dumbest game ever, no questions asked. I thought Sega would do a better job for a game like this! Let me explain my experience:Well, first of all, I rented this game (good thing too) and I came home excited to play it because I'm really into monsters, and creating and customizing stuff. Well so I played it and I hated it. That's all there is to be said about ""Stupid, stupid, stupid Amazing Island!!!!!"" It's a good thing I only rented it, because I almost wanted to buy it before I knew what it was like. :-( DON'T RENT OR BUY IT! DON'T PLAY IT, PERIOD!"
0,It's going back!,I orderd this lens a few days ago and I am not keeping it. Here is my reviewPros:* Solid build quality* Fast and quiet autofocus* Well controlled Barrel Distortion even at 17mm.Cons:* After testing this lens for 2 hours. 95% of the pictures were comming out dark with some indoor pictures having dark corners even with my flash on. Picture taken at 2pm on a bright sunny day were dark and colors were dull!!!*My other L lens EF 70-200 f 4 (from 4 years ago) takes amazing picture compared to this one.ConclusionI think this is quality assurance issue. We are in bad economical times and Canon is getting cheap.Now I have to spend $20 to send it back...I am thinking that I am much better off walking into a store and paying the extra bucks and test the lens before buying it...or get a used one from 4 to 5 years ago. In otherwords treat any lens produced in the last 2 years like a Sigma lens test it before you buy it
1,Great workout,"ORDER THIS!! I was introduced to Minna after after seeing and doing a brief workout with the Fitness/Exercise On Demand Channel. After doing this routine a few times, I soon ordered the DVD and haven't been disappointed. It is an incredibly wonderful workout for fat burning. The added Bonus 15 minute training for abs really hits the spot (ouch! in a good way). I especially liked the Grace and Balance portion. Minna is concise and uplifting in that she provides a different type of cardio workout. The routine is not boring and very doable. You can start out slower if you need to and work your way up to her speed (which is what I did). I am very happy I ordered this DVD and you will too."
0,Do not buy this,"My first unit lasted about 5 months, and I had it replaced under warranty costing me about $40 or so in shipping costs and about a month's time. The replacement lasted about a year before it just suddently stopped working. The unit is quiet, so I didn't notice that it quit working until I saw the temp was at 81. I wonder how long it was out before I noticed? Customer service has yet to respond to my inquiry - it's been about a week now. Bad product is matched by bad customer service."
1,Nice Iron,"I bought this iron about two years ago. I'm forever leaving water in it, even when it's off. Big mistake as it spits water, as well as the heating element doesn't work properly. Irons aren't made to take this abuse, and now I have to get another. However, I'll buy another just like this as I love the titanium finish on the soleplate. I can't tell you how many times I've used fusible fabric, and it never stuck! Much better than any non-stick surface I've used. Wish I could get the iron repaired, as everything else works fine."
0,Not exactly symmetrical,"I would return this if I could. I thought this would have been a terrific razor considering the reviews. However, after a few months of use and switching blades (again, switching) I have noticed that one side shows more blade than the other...hence one side of the shave is ""closer"". Not sure what to do."
0,Dissapointing.,"The word that I frist heard describing Kelly's new Album was edgey, and if by edgey you mean full of annoying guitar melody's then it is very edgey. The lyrics are fine, but they would have worked so much better if they were put the good music. Like I said the lead guitar is just overwhelming and annoying. Kelly Clarkson is famous because she is an amazing singer, and I don't want to hear her overshadowed with guitar melodies and overproduced background beats."
1,Sugar Artistry!,"Wanted this book for several years--Gave up owning this book, due to being out of print with an extremely high resale price ($99.00 plus). Now that it is more reasonable - so I am now a very proud owner! This is a great addition to my collection of her books. She was my first ""idol""!"
1,Great toddler book,"My 21-month-old son adores this book. The illustrations are bright and cheerful. The story has fun sounds to make, and he learns to count throughout the book. A wonderful toddler book."
0,Product still faulty in 2008,"My husband bought me this tool in 2008 and it has the same fly-apart head construction that other reviewers describe. Mine even broke a window. The tool is so non-functional that I don't see how B&D could have put it on the market. They clearly didn't test it themselves. When it isn't flying apart, it consumes cutting line as if it were spaghetti. I would NOT buy another string trimmer from Black and Decker."
0,salt leaks out of the bottom,I purchased these salt and pepper shakers because they looked nice. They don't hold a lot of salt or pepper and the salt leaks out of the bottom. This was a bad purchase. I would not recommend them to anyone.
0,Poorly made,"I got this doll for my 3 year old grandson, while he was playing with it, the very first day we got it, his leg snapped off. The joint broke completely, and he was not playing rough with it...just carrying it around, by the head no less. He tried to take the mask off and...*SNAP* the leg came off."
0,She's Lost Her Keen Eye,"This is perhaps the fourth book by Ann Tyler that I have read and I realized after completing it, I continue to look for and hope for the bite, the razzle-dazzle keen eye she had for the human condition found in her earlier work.Alas, it isn't in The Amateur Marriage. This book has a cast of completely forgetable and unlikable characters, mundane plotlines and conflict, and no real developmental arc to any of them. If this is her subtle metaphor for life and marriage, well, thanks, but that's not my experience and that's certainly not why I shell out 25 bucks to read fiction! I like real life portrayed presented through the language of a gifted wordsmith--someone who can take ""ordinary"" and hold it up as extaordinary--she's done that before! Life's too short and I'll probably not waste another minute of it wading through another Anne Tyler novel."
0,"Adequate, eventually","This tripod is easy to setup for hands-free shower usage, but the nozzle hangs too low for stand-up showers. In part because I've hacked in a much better shower head for the Zodi hose that hangs even lower, I also had to hack an extension for the upright to get the entire rig to hang just above my head (I'm 5'10; thankfully my shower hut is 7' :). If you need to raise the curved piece, a piece of 3/4"" white PVC tubing slides right over the tubes with enough support for the top piece and the shower head, without throwing off the tripod balance too badly.Also, on first assembly, we found how poorly the curved piece at the top was welded to the supporting upright; it came off in my hands with very little pressure applied (the other reason why the PVC sleeve became necessary; I have no welding facilities, and didn't think solder would be as strong as I needed.)It looks good in principle, but the low height and cheap manufacture work against it in my books."
0,Season two Sucks in Japanese Audio........,"Like I said in my review of the season one box set......DON'T BUY IT, IT IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!!!!!!!Update: Reported by ICv2 in April 2010, Toei is now offering all 200 episodes refurbished of the series for internatioal soliction( I don't know if they included the two specials and the three movies though(please have someone answer that part)). Sorry it came so late."
1,Good Study Bible,"Very good study Bible. McCarthur is very diligent in studying the Bible and all types of resources surrounding it such as history, Greek, Hebrew, other Christian works, secular works, etc. Not a big fan of NASB or NKJV of the Bible, though many prefer them. In some cases the reading is more difficult. For example (NASB then KJV) magi-wise men, dissipation-riot, sordid-filthy, diadems-crowns. Obviously there are examples where the opposite is true also. Another place to look at some NASB changes is hissheep.org. A good, understandable KJV non-study Bible is the Defined King James Bible by Bibles for Today. Hardcovers are reasonably priced. Anyway the McCarthur Bible is a good and informative study Bible."
0,Zzzzzz,I could not get interested and eventually gave up. There are too many good books to read without wAsting time on this.
0,Moon Pool and cave diving,"I bought this book without very high expectations, because it was apparently published originally as a mass-market paperback. But I'd been told it had a hi-tech cave-diving theme, and it did turn out to mention several cave-divers I know. (But the scene is really a flooded mine.) It's not a mystery; you find out whodunit on the first page of the first chapter. I guess it's a suspense thriller. I found it readable, but the author's inclusion of lots of unnecessary facts in an effort to show off his research skills did get a bit tiresome. The author is better at technology than character development."
0,clean up daily :(,"Absolutely disappointingcant pour out of carafe without a total mess on counter top talk about frustrating...I would rather wait a couple minutes longer for brewing than to have half of it on my counter ... never will i own a Bunn again ,,, mistake ..."
1,Excellent,What can I say? Rochelle has yet to disappoint me in the things she's written. I truly enjoyed the Hideway Saga and this after not reading a romance novel in over 20 years.
0,Not high enough,This seems to be well made but I have a 4 month old toy poodle. Weighs 3.2 pounds. She gets over this. Not good for any dog since they don't come too much smaller than mine
1,Nice hat for the price,"This is a nice mid level hat. For the 12 bucks I paid, I certainly am happy with the hat. It seems well made and should last me the entire baseball season (I play on an adult baseball team with the Indians as our mascot). If you are wearing it casually, I'm sure it would last several years."
0,Full of Rah Rah Rah,"Here's all he should have put in this book, ""You can do it"" because that's all I found. Very little in this book was helpful to me, maybe that's because I didn't want to read a book that only talked about how great the author was and how you can do it too. Mind you, he didn't actually tell you how, but he told you he was going to, up until the end of the book."
1,pet water dishes,This is a great product. I've purchased several of these in different sizes. I bought one of the larger ones which was a little too heavy for me to manage so I have multiple smaller ones. They're easy to use and go right into the dishwasher.
0,A little disappointed,"If you need help choosing and interviewing doctors, mid-wives, nannies, etc., there are many pages dedicated to helping you do so. However, I felt this did not apply to me personally. Also, there aren't enough blank spaces to take notes, just a few lines. I was expecting more space to take day-to-day notes. I ended up buying another journal after using this for a week."
1,Love it!,I love this sink and wish I had bought it years earlier. It was so easy to install. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a single bowl sink. I also like how deep it is.
0,What on earth?,"I watched the preview and decided to rent this from iTunes. That was a big mistake... I remember thinking that the preview probably was the best part of the movie, and sure enough... You'd need an army of disbelief to suspend to make this even plausible.This could have been fun, if it had gone campy and not tried to take itself serious... but NO! And don't even get me started on the ending.I just don't know what they were thinking... This disaster movie is a disaster!"
1,Very good product.,My son soesn't like the variable nipple so I tried this one. He takes the bottle very well. Only problem is that it's hard to find at stores. So buy extras when found.
1,Learning to keep Sabbath Holy,A Great read for those looking for the reason why to remember the Sabbath. This book is a classic. The body of the book shares why and how God calls us to a time of rest. Heschel's daughter's introduction shares how sacred this time was for her family growing up and the various ways they celebrated the Sabbath. I purchased the book to read a Jewish perspective on Sabbath from a beloved Jewish scholar and I was not disappointed.
1,Great product for a great price,"Title said it all. I was able to install the Oxygen Sensor in less than 15 minutes and I'm not a mechanic. With the new sensor installed, I was able to reset my check engine light and passed CA smog test without any glitches."
1,Great Device,"The best money I have spent on my house. I put one in my second story laundry room and one next to my air handler, and I sleep much better now. The one in the laundry room has already alerted us to a splashing situation caused by an overfilled washer and I am sure it saved us more time and money than it cost."
0,Description Needs Editing,Instead of 10-inch should be 9 1/2 inch. Should state skillet has humorous oblong shape instead of tired looking circular shape.
1,fair quality for the price,"I found the aluminium frame a bit heavy and the handlebar not very confortable. Moreover I had to adjust brakes and shifts when I got it, and the instructions were not that usefull. Overall I think is a fair quality for the price."
0,Even their own techs couldn't make it work...,"Perhaps the worst computer product I've ever owned. Spent nearly four hours with a D-Link tech, a tech from my ISP and a tech from my satellite provider. None of them could get this thing to connect to my modem despite trying every imaginable configuration.Took it back to the store where I purchased it and traded it for an older and cheaper Linksys Wireles-G router that was up and running in 15 minutes.Normally I like D-Link products, but this one is junk. Avoid this router like the plague."

1,70's Movie Not Bad,"Well for a British movie of the 1970's, this one is not bad, this Zombie movie has it all, nudity, gore, suspense, a graveyard, non beliving cops, but the best part of it all is how the zombies come to life, it will make you laugh. Still it has momements of edge of your seat suspense and ripping bloody moments. It even has an introduction by the director of the movie who lets you know this is a movie that should cause you fear."
1,Loved it!,"Tall, Dark & Hungry was another hot, sexy and funny book by Lynsay Sands.I loved Bastien and Terri, their story was amazing! And it was really great that Lucern and Kate (from the previous book) were present in this story as well. Planning their wedding sure didn't go smoothly LOLOh, and I just love Vincent, the somewhat strange cousin. I hope there will be a book about him cause I want to get to know him better.I'm curious to see who the next book will be about!"
0,Not terribly exciting,"My kids listen to a very wide range of styles, but were not remotely interested in this CD."
1,Slick Design,With record snow in this area I needed to get the white stuff off my roof. This product is great! It is MUCH easier to use that a snow rake. I used a snow rake the week befor this arrived and my arms were killing me. This product was much easier on my arms. What a great design! The only downfall is the pastic chute can tear on the ice but tape fixed it quickly. And replacement chutes can be ordered.
1,Hours of fun,"My son asked for this software for Christmas last year, after he discovered the joy of stop-motion animation. Even with the limited camera placement options available with my laptop's built-in iSight camera, he enjoys making Legos and Hot Wheels zoom around the room.I have to imagine that software of this caliber would have cost professional animaters thousands of dollars just a few years ago, and I can hardly believe that we live in a time when it is inexpensive enough to serve to entertain a kid on a quiet evening."
0,Irving's Worst Novel: Read Eveything Else but This,"This novel is tedious, redundant, and utterly boring. Irving is one of my favorite writers of all time: Cider House Rules is by far his best with interesting characters and profound social commentary. Hotel New Hampshire and World According to Garp are incredible. A Widow for One Year is astoundingly well done and very entertaining. This one blows!"
1,A Christmas Story,A fun and entertaining family movie that is sure to please all. Something that you must watch every Christmas season.
0,EA Games begining to SUCK !!!!!,All they doing is adding a $1.00 new feature and asking us to pay the $50.00 for it. If they dont change their strategy soon than it's bye bye for them. I will not buy any other games from EA until they make worth while.
0,Really saves wear and tear on your hand,"Having a very bad hand, these pens are perfect for me. But the ones I bought on line seem to be much more cheaply made than the ones I bought at a local store. They fell apart from being carried in my purse. I do, however, love the colors.If you can find these in stores, I think they are better but the overall design of the pens makes writing much more comfortable."
0,poseurs,"I think I liked this stuff better 10 years ago when it was a wee bit more original and fresh. Hopelessly derivitive. And they deny it! At least STP admits their influences. Creed , please go back to Florida and play again at Disney or wherever."
0,No Yo Yo,"I dont recall hearing much Yo Yo Ma during what I could take of the CD. Yelling and screaming followed by passages of instruments with unlistenable melodies. Every CD has songs that arent as listenable as the others. But thats ALL this disc offers. I was angry at myself for havinng paid money for it. Had I the opportunity to listen before I bought, I would not have bought this. I sometimes enjoy listening to the SDTK from Crouching Tiger, Flying Daggers, Hero, or other films when practicing martial arts. I was expecting more of that. I got none of it. Even the last track on this CD is a partial lift from the Crouching Tiger disk! its not even the whole song!! Thats the only track I recognized Cello from.I want my money back"
1,Great Hiking Resource,"Having just moved here, I needed a book that would take me to out-of-the-way, non-touristy hikes. This one does it. The only drawback is that the directions to the trailheads are not as detailed as I would like."
1,Should have bought this before any others,"I bought this last year for my daughter when she switched to a dual-mode booster seat in hopes of providing additional protection for the car from the car seat. I had previously used several variations of a car seat protector but none offered the same type of stiffness as this one. It offers a little more protection than the softer ones. The bottom pad has a slight lip that curls up which I found has caught some crumbs from my daughter's snacking. With small children, crumbs are invitable but it was nice to see that the seat protector caught some of the crumbs too. My 9 month old son is still rear facing but using the softer seat protectors which flop down at his feet. If I had it all do over again, I would have purchased this from the beginning."
1,Good for Brew N' Go,"These fit the Brew N' Go well, but could stand to be a little bit taller. I like to use a lot of fairly coarsely ground coffee to make a cup, which means that my minimum volume of grounds is the maximum this filter can carry. Another half inch or even an inch would make a huge difference - there's certainly space in the coffee maker for it!If you're a normal coffee drinker, though, using fewer, finer grounds, this is an excellent choice for you."
1,The BEST Book EVER on AutoLISP Programming !!!!,"I did not need any other book on AutoLISP programming - This book went with me anywhere I did - the toilet , my bed , my computer desk. It DID NOT teach DCL programming so I bought another (by Christian Immler). If you want to see what I used AutoLISP for - check the website mentioned below. If you can get the book it - DO IT ..."
1,This should be stacked next to Monopoly,"This book is well executed, brilliant and revolutionary. However unrealistic it may be- it still shows great evolution of the character and his attributes and fulfills a primitive need for warfare and the birth of an epiphany after you read it. A great book almost all-around; it also lacks Card's religious outlook which shows his massive strength as a writer."
0,A HUGE WASTE OF MONEY!!!!,My 5 1/2 month old monster who is 28 inches long cant even touch the floor with the walker on its lowest setting. He is interested in the toys for about 5 min and then gets bored so the only way to keep him interested is to put a different toy on the tray. I would not suggest this walker to anyone.!!!!
1,"""SELENA"" WILL ALWAYS BE #1 IN MY HEART","EVERY CD ""SELENA"" EVER MADE WILL ALWAYS BE A BIG HIT BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH SHE NOT HERE WITH US SHE IS SHINING FROM UP ABOVE AND SMILING AT ALL THOSE WHO WERE TRULY HER FANS AND HER NEW ONES TOO. YOU'LL ENJOY ALL OF HER CD THAT'S A GUARENTEE. ALWAYS REMEMBERED ""SELENA"", -CLAUDIA-"
1,Excellent desktop replacement computer,"This is not a lightweight machine and its battery life is a little over 2 hours. And it gets rather warm, and the fan is a bit noisy. But if you want a powerful desktop-replacement computer with a wide, high-res display, plenty of RAM, a large hard disk, a fast processor and all the bells and whistles (ethernet card, wireless, DVD/CD-RW, USB, firewire, etc...) and don't plan to carry it everywhere or use it on 7-hour flights, it's an excellent machine. I've been using it for 6 months. The first thing I did was repartition and put linux on it, and everything works fine under linux, except the modem (a winmodem, as usual), maybe that can be made to work too but I haven't tried since I don't really need it."
0,These hoses make your power steering pump whine.,"I installed one of these on my '02 Maxima a couple of years ago. Even after bleeding the system perfectly, my car still whines like an old Ford Grenada in parking lots. I really recommend spending the extra money for the factory Nissan hose instead of trying to save money with this one. This hose does seem to do the job though, and so far my power steering pump hasn't failed, but I can't imagine the noise it's making is good for it."
1,The Best Video of Yosemite on Blu-ray Disc,"This is a grander view of Yosemite like you've never seen it before.Having just watched this, I can truly say that Blu-ray picture qualityjust doesn't get any better than this. Almost every scene is amasterpiece by veteran nature photographer Bob Glusic. Not only are allof the well-known landmarks of Yosemite featured here, but many backcountry areas of exquisite beauty fill this disc. Snow, ice, flowers,wildlife, walking along trails and river banks abound here - but unlikeother national park videos you've seen, you rarely see people. Nolodges, crowded trails, shops, cars - just the wilderness that gives youa feeling of solitude and being one with nature. You can choose tolisten to a narrative description and great music, or just ambientsounds."
0,not worth it,"I read this a while ago, and was thoroughly unimpressed. The plot is disjointed, the characterization nonexistent, the prose style clunky, and the book's attitude on gender relations is irritating and simplistic. Perhpas she had some interesting ideas in there, however, strangely enough (perhaps due to the clunky prose style) they all came off as shallow and undeveloped. Maybe some of her other work is better, but I wouldn't know, as I've never picked up another Tepper book since."
0,A Real Non-Debate,"As an associate of the Jesus Seminar I was disappointed by this debate. The two spoke past each other.Craig was impressive in presenting what he believes to constitute evidence for the historicity of the Gospels. However, if Crossan is right and the Gospels were never intended to be historical documents but, rather, metaphorical prose, Craig's efforts are as useful as arguing for the historicity of the little boy who cried wolf. He does it well, but so what?Because this matter was not adequately addressed, this debate was little more than two impressive scholars ignoring each other and making interesting speeches."
1,Well written and insightful analysis combined with engaging personal stories,"I found Free to Learn insightful, as the authors navigate through several different charter school success stories, highlighting inefficiencies in public schools and the mechanisms that allow charter schools to more adequately handle these situations, without superfluously extolling virtue. Yan and Izumi deftly touch upon both commonalities and differences between these successful charters - emphasizing the fact that there is no ""one size fits all"" solution. Yet, comparisons with non-successful charters are included for a balanced viewpoint. Lastly, the personal stories of those students lives affected or the principals and teachers driving positive change give this policy book a very human feel."
0,Leak!,"thought it was a great idea but they leak and the ones with the straw fall apart easily, the clasp the holds the lid shut came off after only one use."
1,Going to Bangkok on vacation can be risky!,"I just finished reading ""Forget You Had a Daughter"" by Sandra Gregory and I found it to be one scary book. Young people take a lot of chances and this young lady took one too - big mistake. She should have just called home and asked her parents for money. That's what parents are there for (I'm a parent, and I know!). I enjoyed the book immensely and felt badly for the author who lost a lot of years in her young life to prison. Glad that she's doing well now and has moved on! On a lighter note, my daughter walked past the book on my dresser and was very hurt to think that I would read a book about trying to forget that I had her. I had to explain the title to her and I also had to interject a life lesson about the potential dangers of traveling abroad with drugs. I think she was sorry she brought the whole subject up!"
0,Bilderberg: The True Story Pastor Mike Hoggard,"Montreal, 7 February 2012.I made a mistake when I ordered this DVD.In this DVD Pastor Mike Hoggard makes extensive comments and describes links of activities of theBilderberg group with themes found in the Bible.I was disappointed because I thought the DVD would be a documentary on present and past activities of the secretive Bilderberg group.This DVD was of no interest to me.J.C.Chirgwin"
1,A Revolutionary Model for Church Leaders,"Cooke has given the church a powerful tool for change. Realistically speaking, today's church is not radically changing the lives of its people. Cooke has discovered and patterned the key to life-changing Christianity as portrayed in the early church. This is a book that every Christian leader should read - and put to practice!"
0,Scary...but...not.,"This Game is definitely not a game that i would recommend. The graphics are horrible and its completely outdated. The achievements are impossible, and the game itself is just terrible. Save your money, don't buy it. But if you really want to get the achievements, than buy the game for like 3 or 5 bucks. Good luck."
1,Good ideas but it's definitely a future Hollywood movie.,"This is really not a bad book. I realize that he is manipulating his name and writing with intent to eventually make money off of a Hollywood box office hit but this story makes you think. His past books didn't really do that. Homelessness is running rampant all of our country and the majority of the U.S population (270 million) don't think twice about it, only that they don't wish this terrible misfortune to fall upon them. But many of these people didn't take to life on the streets because they wanted to. The reasons are diverse. Grisham is a good writer overall and I think for the first time he has attempted to make his large fanfare think about deeper issues than just about courtroom procedure, etc. I hope he continues on this track."
0,Another misleading item,"As many other reviewers have noted, this mount does NOT fit all or even most eTrex GPSrs. I bought this with my nice new eTrex 30, hoping I could mount it to my bike. Nope! Back doesn't come anywhere near fitting the new 10, 20, or 30 models. I think someone (?) should rewrite this ad to indicate exactly which models it DOES fit. And since the cost is low, it is not worth returning. I would hardly get enough to cover postage, and I don't love the USPS enough to just GIVE them my money! Sorry, Amazon, someone (you or Garmin) dropped the ball on this one!"
0,The most clished science fiction series of the last 20 years,"Usually i don't like alien invasion stories since there are stereotypical and unsophisticated but i was willing to give this a chance. I was vastly dissapointed. Falling skies is an amalgam af the most clished ideas in science fiction tv (since we saw them many times before). Good heroic humans fight evil aliens. Add to this the unavoidable (these days) family drama between a father and a son, the stereotypical character of a ""heroic"" commander and a totally clished aproach to human emotions and you have one of the most boring science fiction tv series of the last 20 years (at least). But ofcourse there is also Terra Nova which is even worst!"
1,Got kids of different ages? Then buy this game.,"I have a 4 year old and 6 year old. Both boys. This is just about the ONLY game they have which they will both play together, for long periods of time, without adult input.The only downside? The balls included with the game too often find their way to other uses ... or under the sofa.... but if you've got two young children of different ages, I highly recommend this game."
1,Awesome! If you never got to go to Spring Break,Awesome! I don't remember this movie coming out in theatres so it must not have done well. I thought it was funny through out especially if you never got to go on Spring Break and would go if you had the opporunity to party with the college kids.
1,A Brief Word,"I'd just like to say that the author who supposedly wrote the other book that is similar to Endgame ought to shut up. It's wrong to rate a book with 1 star when you haven't even read it!!! I don't think Nancy Garden woke up one day and said, ""You know, I should copy the author of Shooter. Yeah, that's a great idea."" By the way, who says that you didn't copy Nancy Garden?"
1,Good,"In comparison to most novels, this perhaps deserves more than 4 stars. But in comparison to Marillier's other novels, I have to own I was a bit disappointed.The story does draw you in and hold you, but the expectations created by the Sevenwaters Trilogy didn't quite hold up."
1,Great boat for small lakes or ocean surfing,I love this boat. It is great for small lakes and fishing. i also love breaking the waves on the beach with it. it has very thick pvc for its price too! I recommend this boat for everyone!!!There is no complaints for this boat for the price.
1,Amazing colors!,"These are an amazing set of coloring dyes. I've used wilton dyes and they are a pain. You have to use something to get the dye out but make sure no food gets into the coloring. These dyes are much, much easier to use, just squeeze the bottle. There is no mess at all and you can have more control over how much color you add. Also these squeeze bottle's make it easier to repeat the colors more accuratly just count the drop's."
0,Too sensitive,"After using the strips a few times, and pumping and dumping during those sessions after drinking 1-2 drinks, I decided to try it to see if it would detect any alcohol the following morning (10 hours after my second glass of white wine the preceding evening). It turned dark green-blue, indicating that I had a significant amount of alcohol in my milk. No way. The instructions do admit the test is ultrasensitive, sometimes being affected even by vapors in the air...but even in the absence of cleaning products or other sources of alcohol in the area, it still is way too sensitive in my opinion. I agree with a previous reviewer...use common sense, and wait the 3 hours for each drink consumed. This test is too expensive and too sensitive to be useful in my opinion."
0,Bigggest Brother,"Too many innacurate facts. I recommend ""Beyond Band of Brothers"" by the man himself, Dick Winters. I don't think he totally approved of ""Biggest Brother""."
1,Buy It!,"Though there are disparaging reviews about this book, and I can understand their positions, I cannot agree with them. The knowledge in this book is extremely thorough and the slow presentation of information makes it more likely to be remembered when needed than from such books as Back to Basics or Storey's Basic Country Skills. I find that this retention is a great thing so that you do not always have to keep referenceing the book or kicking yourself when you go to buy your first sheep and cannot remember what you are supposed to look for.I also love the recipes. They are concise, easy to follow, and several are presented on any given page."
1,"Does it's job, but the suction cup eventually wears out","This thermometer is easy to read, floats in the tank, and appears to accurately tell the temperature. The issues that I have had with it are: 1) it is glass, and my turtles have actually bitten the thermometer causing it to shatter inside the tank. This left little glass shards in the water. I imagine this wouldn't be a problem if you just have fish. 2) The suction cup eventually wore out and stopped holding the thermometer to the tank. Now it floats around and I can't read it without taking it out of the water."
0,Not what I expected...,"I was very disappointed in this book. It gives a brief summary of the workings of Access, which I already knew. However, it is very skimpy on the technical details involved in publishing a database to the web. There has to be better books out there, somewhere."
1,Great trimmer,"This is the best trimmer I have used. When on 'turbo' mode, the vacuum catches almost all hair."
0,Oh my,"How I really wanted to enjoy this little film. I think everybody else has pretty much nailed the faults of the production pretty well. I really have nothing new to say other than yes its worth a watch, if nothing else than for curiosity, but its really really not that good."
1,I don't know why there aren't many 5 stars!,"This book is great! The storyline doesn't justify the genious within the works. This is the second book of Chuck's I have read (The first being Fight Club) and it is a masterpiece. I was a little disappointed with the end, as I was with the end of Fight Club, but I couldn't come up with a better solution. I loved the ghetto lifestyle of Misty and her family, because it's much more real than what most other books try to display as the ""typical family"". I also was fascinated by the character of Peter and his dirty little secret. I have to say, this is the only book where I actually despised the daughter, Tabby! Urgh! Seriously though, at least check this book out of the library and give it a try, I think it will be worth your time!"
0,"3-wire configuration is common - this switch requires a 4th, neutral wire","A year ago I replaced a fan switch with one of those dial-timer switches which was very easy to install. I thought this switch looked a lot better and the quiet operation sounded great also so I purchased it. According to the manufacturer's website, most new house's electrical systems include a neutral wire configurations and since my house is one year old it did not occur to me check before ordering. My configuration only has a 3-wire setup and without the neutral wire, the timer won't work. One of my friend's is an electrician so I called him and he said that generally only timers for HVAC systems in residential building have a neutral wire setup. So before you order, verify that your existing setup has a neutral wire, because it probably does not."
0,Do NOT read this book,"I bought this book for myself when I was about 4 months pregnant, and thought that it was the worst book in the world for a pregnant woman to read!! I really hated the part where she said that when my husband told me that I was still beautiful that he was lying and when my friends said that they couldn't tell that I was pregnant, that they were just being nice. From what I understand, this woman is not a doctor, and I certainly wouldn't want her as a 'girlfriend'. There are MUCH better books to be read of there."
0,Excuse me...But......,"1. What took Boba Fett so long to get to Tatooine? People who left hours after him were hanging around waiting for him for days.2. How did Luke almost never think of just what happened to him on cloud city?3. Why was Leia making out with the head of the biggest baddest cruelest criminal organization?4. What is Lando doing cooking?5. Why is Jabba making deals with another crime organization?6. Why did Vader no go to Jabba's palace and wait for Luke. Vader knows that Capt. Solo is in Jabba's palace and that Luke will try to go rescue him, duh?7. And why was Xixmor listening in on the emperor's conversation with Vader?8. And please....would the Emperor ever dispose of Vader over some tough thug? Vader killed almost every Jedi in the galaxy except for 2 who had to hide out.9. I think they should try one more time to write this book. the idea was good, the story was not."
1,lanterna does it again,"This could be my favorite of Lanterna's releases. It seems to expand on the cinematic soundscapes of their previous voyages and continue into some new frontier. This album feels like more of a band effort than Lanterna's Sands CD with more drums and bass playing. It lifts you up right from the start and also allows you to drift along with the open vastness that songs like ""Hope"" provide. I'd really like to give it 4.5 stars."
0,"great gift for everyone,,","I purchased 2 of these, one for a gift and one for myself. It was so well recieved as a gift and I love mine. Good for coffee, hot chocolate, salad dressings, anything that is light and needs a little whip. I then purchased 4 more to given as Mother Day gifts. Great kitchen tool."
0,Fragile. Plastic parts not glued on well and they fell off after single use.,We got this for our baby. Some of the plastic parts that are glued on fell off immediately after first use. We returned it for a refund. I would avoid this.
1,Buyer beware......Choose your merchant carefully,I purchased three of these from another vendor through Amazon for less than the combined price + shipping charged by this merchant. I just got them so too soon to rate the performance and hopefully I'll never have a power surge to test them.
1,love it!,Always enjoy these cute stories. Just enough suspense to keep you reading..but cute. I love the main characters and their interaction with each other. I've read the whole series and have not been disappointed yet.
0,Only sticks on glass,"The only problem with this product is it only sticks on glass, not any other smooth surface. Other than that, it is fine."
1,Awesome Author/Book,This book was very interesting. Usually I don't like reading but this book made me want to keep on going. It was a little sad but always intriguing to find out what happens next. Dean Koontz words were always welling to pull you in when least expected. He is a great author. I never really read one of his books until now and I regretted what I was missing.
1,same product - fraction of the price,Just one of these tools with Dremel brand name is $15 at the store. This product works just as well at a fraction of the price. I received them in just a couple of days and free shipping.....you can't beat that!!
0,Vinegar Hill,"I have to say that this is one of the worst books I have ever read. I found the book to be disjointed, confusing, and extremely slow. There was not sufficient character development so I never got to the point of really empathizing or sympathizing with any of them. I really feel that the theme of the book had so much promise and was never explored thoroughly. A simple story with conversation would have been a more satisfying read than the way the author chose to tell the story. A definite thumbs down.!"
0,A Major Disappointment,"The first three books of the Earthsea Trilogy were phenomenal. They were stirring high fantasy that stand as masterpieces. Then Tehanu came out and collapsed the whole thing.I don't know what issues the author was struggling with, but it would seem that the tone of the book is one of bitterness. Judging by the harsh tones toward men, I can only assume a divorce or death. It is unfortunate, if this is the case, that the author could not filter her pain in a more creative manner, instead of wearing it like an open wound.I am very disappointed in what destroyed a wonderful series."
0,"Million Dollar Consulting, Part II","After having spent almost twice the money for this book than Alan's ""Million Dollar Consulting"", I found little to no new information. Take my advice: buy a copy of Alan's wonderful ""Million Dollar Consulting"" and spend the savings elsewhere in your practice. Good luck."
0,Texsport Westview Screen Arbor,This item is without a doubt the worst waste of money in my life. I threw it into the trash. I rate it no stars.
0,Runaway song,"I haven't listened to every song on this CD. However, I have heard ""Ready to Run"", ""I Love You"", and ""Maneater"". All of them are good. However,the most important song of all is missing: ""Every Breath You Take"" by the Police. It relates very well to the movie and was even on VH1's list of the 100 Greatest Rock and Roll Songs of All Time. So why did it fail to appear on this album? I was considering buying this CD, but now I see that my money would be wasted."
1,"Excellent, non-stop read, something the government should read!","A great, riveting, not-so-ficitonal novel of the current immigration situation and America's place in the world today. It is almost as if the world took note from this book in the events that have been happening. The government could use this book as a potential threat primer. Detailed, non-stop action from an author that has put serious energy into his writing. If you like Tom Clancy, this is much better, and very relevant to our current times."
1,TF-3,this knife is amazing. love the finish on the blade. handle is comfortable and gives excellent grip. for me the rope cutter isnt all that useful but for others it might be. clip is a little tight but that should fix itself over time. opens quickly and is very crisp. blade comes shaving sharp. my only complaint is that its blade has a fair amount of play which i fixed by tightening the pivot this causes it to be hard to open but it u put some marvels mystery oil on the pivot and work it a little it gets silky smooth
0,a little something about this young paleontologist,"Stephen Louis Brusatte (b. April 24, 1984 in Ottawa, Illinois), is a young American paleontologist.He is the author of the 2002 book Stately Fossils: A Comprehensive Look at the State Fossils and Other Official Fossils. Brusatte has additionally authored several scientific papers as well as over 100 popular articles for magazines such as Fossil News, Dino Press, Dinosaur World, and Prehistoric Times. Upon completion of a B.S. in geophysical sciences at the University of Chicago in 2006, Brusatte was awarded a Marshall Scholarship to study at the University of Bristol in the United Kingdom."
0,Plastic Pegs,"I purchased this set of Chinese Checkers for my octogenerian mom, who always loved this game. I was disappointed in the quality of the pegs. They are plastic and shallow and tend to slip out of their holes during play."
0,DO NOT BUY the cd,"Okay, this is getting out of hand. My girlfriend's daughter started lessons, and the teacher said to go buy this book. So I pick it up WITH THE CD. Oh no giant mistake. Each track on the cd (gee, only 150 tracks) has no ""count."" Useless. Guess when the track starts. Now? How about now? Oops, you missed it. What a hunk of junk. A waste of $20. ""Corporate"" America at its finest."
0,Product is not just unsafe; it's dangerous and should be banned from being sold to the general public.,"The Juicer leaked badly on the first use, and then went crazy and started spinning in a rough way on the kitchen countertop causing breaking several glassware and causing terror to my wife and kids. I rushed to unplug the wire but it kept spinning and shaking in strange way for 5 more minutes. Product is not just unsafe; it's dangerous and should be banned from being sold to the general public.I will contact my congresswomen to raise the issue of unsafe house appliances and equipment sold in the market with no federal supervision. I'm also looking into taking legal action against the company for damage done to my kitchen and kitchenware."
1,"Accurate, In Depth","First, I love Shelby Foote. I have seen him as a commentator in many documentaries. I would love to give him a Five star rating for this treatise, but I can't . I am absorbed with the civil war, but I got bogged down in the minutiae of this account. Sorry. For a historian, it would be a great read! I'm not a historian and I prefer the writing style of Jeff Shaara."
0,boring,"Though it had alot of action scenes, the character development was bad and they talked so fast in the beggining you couldn't tell what they were saying. Since you couldn't get into the characters, the overload of action scenes was hard to get into."
1,Amazing musicality and gorgeous vocals!,"Goodness deserves a much wider audience than it is presently enjoying. I have a wide range of tastes when it comes to music; I've also listened to a lot of it. Goodness is that rare band that delivers on all fronts: first-rate musicians, meaningful lyrics teamed with an incredible vocalist. Anthem is my first CD from the group but it certainly won't be my last! By all means- give them a listen! You'll enjoy it; they deserve it!"
0,Not my personal favorite,"This is a great football, but it only last a short while. If you buy this make sure to not have anything even slightly pointy around because it'll scrape it and pieces would come off. Mine had a small outer chunk peel off right before hitting a tree branch and going flat :/ avoid trees!"
0,Revisionist nonsense,"The book is nonsense. If it was truly accepted as a doctoral dissertation, the University on Nantes has lowered its standing as an academy valuing truth. Interested readers are directed to Saul Friedlander's biography: Kurt Gerstein: The Ambiguity of Good (apparently OUP and not available from Amazon). Gerstein's account has been affirmed by, among others, some of the people who were there and were later tried (see Gitta Sereny's Into That Darkness for interviews with Franz Stangl and others). Finally, Yitzhak Arad's Belzec, Sobibor, Treblinka: The Operation Reinhard Death Camps gives a definitive look at these institutions."
1,Truly A Stan Kenton Classic,"Trying to find CD re-issues of those cherished 78rpm records, some a long time broken, can be difficult. Sometimes CD re-issues are of doubtful quality. 'Stan Kenton 1951' is excellent. Although not strictly serious in jazz terms this album contains many favourites from Stan's halcyon days. The gymnastic contortions of Maynard Ferguson's trumpet on 'Hot Canary' have been long sought and the crowning glory has to be 'Blues in Burlesque', Stan's tongue in cheek tribute to traditional jazz blues. These tracks in particular don't appear to have been re-issued anywhere else and are a joyous find for a true Kenton fan. Excellent sound reproduction makes this CD a 'must have'."
1,Another Fabulous CD By George Gee,"This CD recorded live in NY, at the Roseland (in 1999) is an EXCELLENT live CD. Most of the songs are ones we all love from George Gee, there are quite a few moderate tempo songs that are great to lindy hop (swing) to and frankie manning calling the shim sham is an added bonus - which is quite fun to listen to and follow along."
1,,"I just finished reading Evans' The American Prophecies and could not put it down. I found it extensively documented, compelling and a must read for Evangelical Christians seeking to make sense of our current world. Contrary to other reviewers I have read, I do not find Evans a man of hate, but someone who is deeply saddened by the world events he has witnessed and feels a moral responsibity to let others know the dangers we face. In doing this he is well-aware of the attacks that will come his way--but our faith demands sacrifice. Ignoring history in the name of political correctness has cost us so much. The tone of some of the negative reviews reveals much fear and confusion about what is happening right now. While Evans may not be correct about where we are in God's timeline (only God knows), he is brave about pointing out the signs--I just hope even one reader benefits from his ""voice crying out in the wilderness."""
1,50 Stars!!,"Super Smash Bros. is the greatest fighting game ever! It,s non-violent, it's fun, it's funny and it's multiplayer is awesome! It's a great game to play when you have friends over. It's one player mode starts to get boring after the first 100 times you beat it, but it's multiplayer mode is always fun. I highly recomend it to everyone.BUY IT!!!!!!"
1,Latin Big Band,"Probably the best tropical orchestra in Latin America. They have recently released their 100th production making it the number one orchestra with that many albums in the world. you will enjoy everything from merengue, salsa, cumbia and all the up to date rythms. I highly recomend any production from Los Melodicos"
0,Big disappointment,After reading the Da Vinci Code I thought that Dan Brown had something special which lacked in other fictional authors. I started reading Angels and Demons and it just did not hold my interest at all. The main problem is that it jumps right into the plot without developing the characters. It also mixes like a thousand plots at the same time. I didnt even read further than page 100.
1,"*5* star series, but *1* star off for apparently poor dvd","I have been trying to learn Spanish, so I began watching some telenovelas. ""Corazon Salvaje"" (Wild Heart) is one of my favorite television series, I love it. However, I realize from the reviews on here that the dvd is very chopped up and edited, that is why I will not buy it.""Corazon Salvaje"" could get divided into three dvd sets. The first set would contain the first 27 episodes, and the same with the second and third, since if I remember correctly it has 81 episodes in all. These box sets can be released consecutively, several months apart from each other. Of course all with English subtitles.Hopefully ""Corazon Salvaje"" will get released in its complete form, soon. Please!"
0,My first 1-star review,"This thing fell apart after less than a year of use. First, it developed a leak where it mounts to the faucet. That happened at around 3-4 months of usage. Then, the chrome colored bottom piece where the water comes out fell off, so it was chrome finish on top and black on the bottom. That happened at about 4-5 months. Then, it simultaneously developed a much larger crack where the filter rotates and two pin-sized holes on the visual indicator window, so water would spray everywhere when I turned the filter on and even when I wasn't using the filter. That happened at around 6 months rendering this p.o.s. completely useless. It was as if it had been run over by an 18 wheeler, not just sitting on my sink. This could possibly be the worst product I may have ever purchased. Check my other reviews, I can usually find something good to say about a product, but I am completely dissatisfied with this one. I would not recommend this product to anyone, ever."
1,bt in georgia,"we bought this for our 9 year old for his birthday. he loves it! when we read the reviews on it the others said that it was noisy. we have found that it is not that bad, you can tell it is there at first but after awhile you dont even pay it any attention. this saturday we take out the finished product and i think i am just as excited as he is."
1,Sucks you in and freaks you out!,"At first, I felt like I was watching ""Investigative Reports"" on A&E. You know, interesting, but not engaging. However, it wasn't until 1/2 hour into the film, that I realized how involved I had actually gotten. I couldn't turn it off, and I was anxiously riveted to my sofa to find out ""whodunnit."" Congratulations to these two independent filmmakers for a job well done!"
1,A Privilege to Read!,"Stephen White has written a very tight and well paced story. The characters, especially Alan, are interesting and compelling right from the beginning. It's clear that the author knows of what he writes, which lends a great air of reality to the whole story. I loved the ending...surprising, action-packed and lots of fun to read.If possible, I'd read this book before White's others just because many of the characters in this novel re-appear throughout the series."
0,hard to care...,"Basically, this is the story of 22 year old Ariel, and how she tries to make it in the big city after graduating from college. She ends up temping while writing a ""trials and tribulations"" (read ""sex"") column in a local paper. A premise that could have been funny ends up being slightly boring. Ariel tries to appear as a bad girl, using phrases like ""he ground my beef"", but ends up having to make up the dirtiest parts of her column. And then, when she gets notoriety, the way she wanted, she whines about it. I just couldn't really care about the character of Ariel at all.For a more entertaining, and less graphic, story about trying to make it in the big city and failed hopes, try reading ""In the Drink"" by Christiansen. As for this being ""the thinking person's Bridget Jones"" (yes, it says that on the back cover), I beg to disagree. These are very different books. Bridget is purely trying to entertain. Don't ask me what Ariel is trying to do, but she certainly didn't manage to entertain."
0,Eh...,"Taste was ok, but didn't like the little floating peices of glycerol(I think thats what they were) throughout it and really bad once you got to the bottom. Didn't see much difference from this from Kre-akalyn, my previous creatine. Although didn't get that long to test it, only used for about 10 days until i accidentally left it in my car and the extreme heat of the day hardened and ruined it(Leaving in my car does nothing to my NO-Xplode, so assumed this would be fine but was very wrong). After that my brother and I tried to use it for a couple more days, each day we got horrible, horrible stomach aches and pains from it. DO NOT LEAVE THIS IN HIGH HEAT."
0,Not what I thought it would be,"Bought this to replace a cordless Shark thinking the reviews made it sound even better. It will be back to the Shark for us. This picks up hair, but leaves most heavier items (like sidewalk salt or sand) right where the vacuum is shut off (you learn to not shut it off until you are over the garbage can)...if, in fact, it doesn't just leave it on the floor in slightly smaller pieces. We bought it for quick clean ups on smooth surfaces, so it has not been asked to do the job of a better vacuum. I should have spent $10.00 more and had something usable."
1,We love them.,The glasses are bigger than what i thought they would be. They are light & do not tip over easily. They are my fav water glass now. They are great & bonus there are made in the USA.
1,Cute but ...,If you are a fan of Heather Graham fan it is on of her typical movies cute and funny but not very original. If you are a fan like me you will love it.
1,A strange proposition . . .,"I must agree with my friend from Forest Hills, New York. The ending does make you scratch your head a piece. However, I have read The Butterfly Hunter and The Japanese Corpse, and this is the man's style for sure. However, I have always detected something very very unusual in his work and something very very American here. The work rings of Heinrich Boll in places, but something intuitive tells me otherwise. You may find the vulgar racial resonations of Det. Grijpstra's work associates uninspiring, but alas.I've always wondered what happened to Frank Serpico. He did vanish to the same part of the world as Van De Wetering, and he was fond of this kind of urban detective fiction. But maybe this is reaching . . . but not as reaching as the ending of this book. I enjoyed it none the less."
1,MASTER OF SHRED DISASTER,BUCKETHEAD IS THE WORLDS MOST DANGEROUS GUITARIST. EVERY ALBUM HAS 30-40 MINUTES OF GREAT MUSIC FEATURING HIS GUITAR & BASS ALONG WITH TALENTED SIDEMEN LIKE LES CLAYPOOL & BRAIN FROM PRIMUS. THE REST OF THE CD IS USUALLY SILLY POEMS AND GOOFY SOUND DROPS. INCONSISTANT BUT SOMETIMES BRILLIANT.
0,Don't believe what you read !!!,"Bought this to install in a 2000 Ford Focus. Does NOT fit !!! Best Buy charged me three times the price for the correct part. According to their reference guide, which was from the same manufacture as this one, my Focus required an Audi/VW/European. I second guessed the kid at the store, but he told me that this is the part number it calls for. It fit and works perfectly. When you remove your old car stereo, you'll find a MALE connection on the end of your antenna. This part also comes equipped with a MALE end which will NOT connect. Make sure it's a FEMALE or you'll be throwing away $8.00 like me."
1,"Give Over It, Meyan is just a toy.","Since when are ""moral values"" something to debate when giving a review for a toy!?! It's a doll. If you don't find it appropriate, don't buy it. It doesn't matter what anyone else does either!! Meygan and the rest of the Bratz Secret Date dolls are a great toy for the mystery of not knowing which doll is included in the other half of the package There's no other hidden, immoral message iherent in the toy unless someone gives it meaning. I say, let girls have fun imagining their futures. It's up the grownups in their lives (NOT a toy company) to instill values."
1,Another Great Series from Paul Henning,"Paul Henning is one of the most underrated television producers. ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" and ""Petticoat Junction"", along with ""Green Acres"", are among the great sitcoms not only from the 1960s but of all-time. I only wish a nice set of DVDs like ""Green Acres"" would be offered for ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" and ""Petticoat Junction"". It would be nice to have all these shows in my DVD collection."
1,The Product works well,"Before I purchased this product did some research on the ingredients: ""Chromium Picolinate"" in Google and found lot of good articles. After being convinced, started using for the last 2 weeks and feel that the Sugar levels are under control."
1,Amazing devotional,"This is my favorite daily devotional book that I have ever used. Ms. Young phrases it in such a personal way, and yet, all according to His Word. I have had one over a year, and have given copies to my daughter and a friend. I love the way this edition is bound in beautiful tooled leather."
1,Country music's hidden angel,"I just received this CD in the mail today, and I absolutely love it. Anita's clear soprano vocals seem to pierce through the emotions of the listener. I would seriously reccomend this to anyone, and I believe that Anita does not get the recognition she deserves as the amazing vocalist that she was. This album is just Anita, in all her glory. Also, if you're a Helen Carter fan like me, she's on here too helping Anita out on some of the songs. Buy it, it's great!"
0,no rotation,"it doesn't even rotate i just received it today, and i flicked it on and it didn't rotate, i tried to look if there was a buttuon to turn on rotation but nothing. Im disappointed and i am returning this item"
1,A good guidebook for a short trip,"I used this book for a recent 3-day trip to Lisbon. The maps in the back are really helpful, but the info in here wasn't as good as other books in this series. It made it difficult to really get a coherent sense of the area before arriving. Still, it makes a good reference for a short trip and the small size makes it great for carrying around."
0,Classic Greenberg,"I had a hard time taking this book seriously, as it is full of false logic and disinformation. No sources are cited, at least not in my edition, leading me to wonder where he learned how pregnancy feels for all women. Like much of his work that I read, I found more false premises here than actual facts."
0,Bulb is NON replaceable,"My toddler fell in love w/ this lamp. Every night he goes to sleep watching the fish swim round and round. I wanted to buy replacement bulbs before the original bulb would go out. My husband took a look at it and said it seemed to be glued in, but couldn't find a wattage number on it or any info. So I emailed the manufacturer and this was his reply:I apologize. Those fish lamp do not have replacement light bulbs.Once those light bulb are out and It will be best to buy another one.Because, changing light bulb would need some tech issue and we do notrecommend it.Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed. Had I known this, I would have never purchased the lamp. I dread the night it goes out and I have to contend w/ my son's tears. Now I'm in the process of looking for a similar lamp w/ REPLACEMENT bulbs."
0,Stopped working after 6 months of use,It was great while it worked.... quiet and efficient. after one summer's use (appx 6 months) we put the unit away and pulled it out again to find that it wasn't drawing any water out from the air. called customer service and they stated it is a compressor problem and that i need to find a repair person on my own to have it fixed since it was past the one year warranty. the repair person suggested we junk the unit and buy something else with an extended warranty. very disappointed with the unit and their customer service.
0,Malawi bedding set,"I ordered this bedding set for my son, I hate it. It is very cute, but when I washed it, it got faded and fell apart. This set is not worth your money.........."
0,Dreaming of the end!,"I could barely get through this book. It was dull, plodding, and made little sense. The main character is a mother who seems to be everywhere but where she is supposed to be, and doesn't seem to know where she's going...although her children try to keep her on track, it doesn't seem as if she cares or even pays attention. Not a good ""southern"" novel in my opinion, and a difficult, not really enjoyable read."
0,Skipper,This DVD looks nice and all but is horrible because it skips and stuff after the first time I watched it. Thumbs down.
1,bracket broke,"- Here is a nice link to compare the brightness of the Planetbike lights:[...]- The plastic mount for helmet was broken when I tried to tight it on my helmet...Good thing is they sell the replacement parts for $3: [...]. So, don't do the same mistake i made...- I mounted on the bike, it is definitely more than "" to be seen "" light. At the angle I mounted light comes to my eyes...you might consider to put an opaque tape to block the light or change the mounting angle- I didnt like the switch. It is a little bit too stiff and if you push it too hard you may break the bike mount.Make sure to counterbalance the downward force you are applying by holding the mount from the opposite side of the switch..Perhaps you shouldnt do this while biking."
0,Too much of Jenkins' personal life; not enough Alaska,"This is the first Peter Jenkins book I have read and I was a bit disappointed. There are some good Alaska moments here, but they are drowned out by Jenkins' personal reminiscences. If I wanted to hear about how melancholy he is about his daughter growing up and moving away I would have bought a different book. I wanted to read about Alaska-- and I found too little of that in this book. (For the record, I lived in Fairbanks for 3 years-- I was looking for the quirkiness and beauty that I remember from Alaska in this book. It wasn't there)."
0,A big waste of money,"I waited to get enough money to buy this game and I was disapointed. I have had it for a week and it isn't getting better. Its like doing the same screens over and over.If you run out of emotion and need to use like say,fire. You have to start over.Get any other Mario game and you will be happy. But this is like a baby game."
0,don't buy this...,"My under-the-cabinet can opener was good, but it didn't open big coffee cans well. When it finally stopped working, I purchased this one because it said it opened any size can, and it is a good name machine. It is horrible. The cutter falls off easily and it takes a couple of trys to get it started opening the can. I am throwing it out and buying something else."
0,Hard to Review,Although the product didn't work when we got it. We did love the size.. and Amazon service is the BEST. Returning it was EASY! Thanks Amazon.
1,Sangean Digital Shower Radio,"Love this product. You can set your favorite radio stations and set the timer to shut it off, so you can continue listening after you're out of the shower. Battery strength indicator is helpful."
0,easily their worst album,"Not sure what happened - this album just isn't on par with their other releases. Doesn't have the feeling of the other albums, many of the tracks cause me to reach for the skip track button as soon as I hear them. Not innovative, sometimes barely musical. If you're new to TWS, start with any other album or your experience with the band won't last long."
1,Christian Card Studio,"Christian Card Studio is truly this desktop publisher's delight. Creating and designing bulletins, programs and flyers for my church is one of my pastime hobbies. This program has enabled me to create some dynamic masterpieces. For Mother's Day, I was asked to design a Mother's Day Memory Journal and I had just purchase a copy of Christian Card Studio software. I exceeded my own expectations. The output was truly a work of art. I have received numerous request to create similar work. I had previously used several other Desktop Publishing software, but this software far exceed any of my existing software. Christian Card studio allows me to use existing verbiage and or add my own personal touch to pre-existing phrases. The artwork is absolutely outstanding. The ability to create a personal touch gives all of my artwork a more professional touch. I look forward to purchasing and using more Christian Card Studio software."
0,Not worth the Money!,"My Nephews are the Biggest Bob the Builder fans!! But this toy is the SMALLEST toy and definitely not worth the money!! If you want something to decorate the topy of a birthday cake with this MIGHT work although still a little small. Bob is only an inch high at the most. I wish I had listened to the other reviewer below who asked ""Why does this cost so much for so little?"""
1,Suprisingly strong story with unique claymation format,"A ""claymation"" Jesus? How's that going to work? Surprisingly well! While artistic license is taken (if you're looking for the real deal, read the New Testament), this ranks up there with films like Franco Zeffirelli's 1977 ""Jesus of Nazareth"" (seriously!). Caution to parents with young children: it has some very intense scenes and should defintely be viewed by parents FIRST. Well done, it was first shown on ABC Sunday night of Easter several years ago."
0,"Dead in a week, ultra bad return policy","I'm not sure of Amazon's return policy, but the manufacturer's return policy is- if this dies on you (which mine did after less than 1 week of use) you have to buy a second one from them at whatever price you bought the first one for, and then ship the old one back, and then they will ship a new one, and then refund the second purchase amount. Ridiculous!"
0,Not worth the time,This is a compilation of newspaper articles of crimes. Very boring and repetitious. I was not able to finish it.
1,Pretty good bottles!,"These were the only bottles I ever gave to my baby, so I'm not sure if she would have liked something better, but she seems to really like them now. She does seem to like the nipple shape and the air stays out of the tip. The only drawback is that they leak and squeak loud if you tighten the cap too tight. Overall, we are very happy with the Avent bottles and nipples, I probably wouldn't buy anything else."
1,Great game but....,"I have had this game for a very short time and have already beat it once and I am on my way through it a second time.I said but bcs although this is a great game it could really be a bit longer and I didn't really find the bosses that hard to beat.But as far as the fun factor goes man this is addictive like I said I am playing it again and the second time through your guns get better and your armour gets better.In summary this game is a must have for your PSP collection,"
0,Unreliable for AV,My problems started with the unopenable package. Documentation and tech-support are lacking. The device/software is erratic when used with a headset (iogear gbmh211w6 on WinXP) -- it doesn't consistently recognize the available services or direct the data appropriately.
0,"GREAT BEATS, HORRIBLE RAP","THIS GUYS ALBUM IS PRETTY GOOD AS FAR AS BEATS GO, BUT HIS RHYMES ARE STALE AND UN INSPIRING, ITS ACTUALLY KIND OF SAD THAT THESE BEATS WERE WASTED. OUT THIS HUGE LIST OF TRACKS I WOULD SAY THERE IS MAYBE 3 TO FOUR DECENT TRACKS, THAT YOU COULD SIT ALL THE WAY THROUGH, BUT THE REST OF THEM HAVE SUCH BAD HOOKS OR LYRICS THAT YOU JUST SKIP IT. HE REALLY HAS NOTHING IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT EXCEPT KILLING PEOPLE AND HAVING SEX WITH RANDOM B!TCHES, VERY VERY OVERDONE. I WISH THERE WAS AN INSTRUMENTAL VERSION, CUZ THAT WOULD BE HOT. ESHAM JUST CALLIT QUITS MAN."
0,Not 100% Cotton,"The cap comes with a polyester lining to which I am extremely allergic. I was going to return the item, but then realized that I could (with a lot of effort) cut the lining out. I did so. Now it's fine."
1,Classic Supertramp 1983,"Great concert by Supertramp,good quality for the time it was recorded,if you like the band just buy it,its the only proper full concert of the classic lineup on dvd."
1,"Great book, great ideas.","This book includes some great, creative ideas for wedding shower planning. It is great for DIY person that wants to create memorable, personalized moments. I will use this book for the 2 bridal showers I am planning next year."
0,terrible game!!,"this is the suckest game ever. dont buy this game. i got this game for present, i just played it once for 5 min and i never want to play it again. only 1 word to describe the game - terrible!!!!!"
0,Horrible,"- back side of the light has a battery cover and this cover also had magnetic plate and it holds the light, but doesn't hold very good.- 4 AAA batteries for a very small light bulb, it's dimm light and it's not enough for the whole tent, bulb should be led for better battery life.- heavy bulky.I got motion activated lights from [...], I velcro it to my tent. ti's work much better and it's about the same price."
0,sorely disappointed,"I was only able to struggle through the first 200 pages. Normally, I finish a book no matter what. I hate unfinished business, but with my time taken up with family and work, I simply just didn't have the time to waste, and it felt as though it would have been if I would have continued.Hobb's writing is still superb, but the plot was simply not going anywhere. I was bored out of my mind."
0,"awful, teachers please do not use!","This is the worst textbook I've ever had to use!! The layout is awful, poor examples, everything about it is awful. You can't even find any definitions or terms. If any definitions are given they are at the end of the section and don't expect them to be bold like most textbooks. The actual text is very dense and is organized poorly. Professors, please don't make your students use this textbook. The won't enjoy the class or get anything out of it."
0,Worst Cornwell ever...,"This was not only the worst Patricia Cornwell book I ever read, it was the worst book I ever read, PERIOD! It was so bad it took me about nine months and three tries to get through. Don't buy the excuse that this was meant to be satire and definitely don't buy this book!"
0,Christmas Pickle Ornament,"I ordered this item on December 21, 2010 and it was supposed to be delivered by December 31 and I just got it on January 13, 2011. I will honestly say I will never buy from them again. They never sent me an e-mail saying that it would be late. It just showed up 2 weeks late...Item was nicely packed with a lot of bubble wrap so the glass bottle would not break. Just UNTIMELY arrival and no noticew whatsoever of it being delayed or late."
0,Boring album,"Music appreciation is very subjective. There need be no justification for one's feelings. Therefore, I award 1 star to this album as I found the singing there to be absolutely boring, especially in those more popular songs. The voice itself isn't good either."
0,This is a pretty dull Biography,"The author tries hard to convince you that Franklin is this superstar world leader, but just doesn't sell it very well. I believe Franklin is everything that history makes him out to be, but this book is written in such a dull manner that you never really get it. I guarantee everyone who has read this book paused halfway through it and were relieved to discover that the last 50 pages are appendices and such ending the misery much earlier."
1,"Fun, Fast, Enjoyable Mystery!","Fatith Fairchild from the fictional Aleford, Massachusetts is the kind of woman you'd like to have for a friend. Her habit of falling into mysteries and murders makes for fun, quick reading. This book explores the somewhat shady world of NE antiques, after Faith's house is broken into and a friend is killed when her house is burglarized. As other readers have noted, the ending is somewhat contrived but up till then, I really loved this book. Start with her earlier novels as Faith has grown from a new young wife, to mom, to mom of two. My only problem with these books? Faith's kids are SO good. Never fuss, whine, wet their pants at the wrong moment. Course if they were written as normal kids, Faith would never get anything done, like the rest of us moms!!"
1,R Kelly's Ignition Remix is the key the the car,Excellent CD and excellent songs! I LOVE Ignition Remix!! R Kelly is a great artist!!! If you like any R Kelly songs this CD is for you!!!
1,A gem of a novel,"This is one of the most enjoyable coming of age novels I have ever read. Based to some extent on the author's own childhood, it tells the story of a young Jewish boy growing up in New York City during the Depression. It ends while he is in the fifth grade, and cries out for a sequel, although after all these years (it came out in 1985) I doubt one is forthcoming. Beautifully written, if occasionally over-written, it is very moving and memorable. Anyone who had a childhood, or is not an alien from another planet, should find World's Fair to be a rewarding reading experience."
1,Obscure gem,"Outside of Tennessee few are likely to have heard of, let alone listened to, Melissa Webb's 1999 self-released debut. But, for those who know Bluegrass pickers, the list of ""friends"" playing on this obscure gem will clue them in that this is not some vanity project.Ms. Webb wrote 9 of the 11 songs on this project, and co-wrote another. Along with her vocals, these lyrics are on the ""folk"" side of the spectrum.Mark Schatz is on bass. Brent Truitt (Nashville session stalwart) is on mandolin here. Kristin Scott (before she married Wayne Benson and added his surname) is on banjo. Husband (or brother?) Keith Webb doubles on fiddle and guitar."
0,Not 4 gauge! More like 8 gauge with thick insulation!,"The cable included in this kit appears to be 8ga with thick insulation to make it look like 4ga. I compared it to a real 4ga and a 9ga cable I had lying around and the wire is only slightly thicker than the 9ga and nowhere near the thickness of the 4ga. If you buy this, you'll note that there are no markings on the cable giving the specs. Also, a 60Amp fuse will give you ~800 Watts max at the amplifier (60 amps x 13.5 volts = 810 Watts)."
0,Dirty Blond,This story line was tough to swallow. Even the most air-headed among us wouldn't do what this babe did to herself and supposedly she had a law degree and thus I assume is not supposed to be considered an air-head.Quality of writing was alright but it is not a book I would recommend.
1,Could have been a Cagney movie,"I had never heard of the story until the movie based on the book ran on TCM in the early hours of the morning. I didn't watch it, but decided I had to have the book.Very film noir feel to the story. If I didn't know better, I'd think Cagney's White Heat character was based on Chase's ""Slim"". The same ""Top of the World, Ma"", coupled with amoral sadistic behavior.At first it was a little hard to change gears in the writer's POV, from the hoods to the detective, but once you figure it out, it is a very nice read."
0,Mislead,The cover mislead me to believe that it was a christmas movie of alvin and the chipmunks. My two year old loves them and this turned out to be a movie that he already had.
1,Amazing series!,"If you enjoy watching wildlife documentaries, you are in for something better than you would expect. David Attenborough has a great voice for narration and the footage is quite wonderful. The behind the scenes on how the shots are taken is very informative and really shows the viewer how much effort has gone into making this series. Soothing for people who need to watch something when they go to bed."
1,Helped Me Get Rid of Back Pain - Permanently,"I bought this book while I was on my way towards improving my lower back pain. At that time I was exercising hard, I had already lost a good amount of body fat, but the pain kept coming back every once in a while. All I did was introduce some of the anti-inflammatory foods in my diet, reduce or eliminate the oness that were highly inflammatory, and in a matter of months, the pain was gone. I'd say it's a pretty good result after over 20 years of pain. Now I can work out hard, play tennis, table tennis, do high intensity interval training, without any pain whatsoever. Just to make one thing clear - I don't see this book as a guide to a diet that you can go on and once you're done you go back to eating the stuff that's bad for you. The way I see it, the food choices, recipes and resources from the Inflammation Free Diet Book are meant to help you make long-term diet changes that will significantly improve the quality of the rest of your life."
1,Great Water Boiler,"The T-Fal 4-Cup Vitesse Electric Water Kettle is a great little kitchen device. Not only is it attractive, but very useful. My experience has found that it can bring one liter of water to boil is a matter of a few short minutes. I love my T-Fal Vitesse that I even bring it with me on vacation, because you never know how clean the coffee machine/water kettle is in the hotel you are staying in. The little kettle is holding up very well, with only a few scraches due to traveling. It has only failed me only once (hence the 4 star rating) when the kettle prematuredly shut off, but that maybe because of my power convertor, as I was in Hong Kong using the kettle. Definitely a must have for every household. Mine was made in France!"
1,Fast shipping and delivery - flawless,"The book arrived in one month, which was fast if you consider that it generally takes more than this to arrive, the book came in excelent conditions.Amazon is always a reliable store."
0,Boring and comercial set!,"I'm very disappointed with this set, definitively all the tracks are very comercial trance and boring, strange to be a GU CD,nothing to do with the Global underground quality sets, if you like the comercial trance buy it.Definitivamente para los que les gusta el trance burdo y comercial este es un buen CD, mas nada que ver con las maravillas que habiamos escuchado como por ejemplo Ibiza de Sasha o Moscu de Deep Dish, creo que es muy el estilo de Seaman ya que se asemeja mucho al set de Buenos Aires."
0,Doesn't wake my son,"My son started wetting the bed after years of being dry. When he was three, I bought a bed wetting alarm from One Step Ahead for $30 that worked GREAT!!! He hated it, though. This one looked like it would be more comfortable for him, so I tried it. It doesn't wake him up EVER. The company doesn't care and won't do anything to try to make it right with me. That's a hundred bucks down the drain."
1,"DW & BI, el futuro del comercio electrónico.","Por fin se empieza a relacionar el comercio electrónico y las tecnologías de los sistemas de información basadas en el Data Warehouse (Business Intelligenece).En este magnifico libro se muestran los conceptos básicos que confluyen en la actualidad en el mundo de los negocios electrónicos, siendo los pilares el comercio vía WEB y los entornos de BI.Recomiendo el libro a todo aquel que desee preveer el futuro del E-commerce cuando la simbiosis con el DW sea completa."
1,IT BLOW ME AWAY!,"Snync's new ablum just blow me away! The ablum is full with lot of enery and makes you want to dances. Snync show me through this CD that they love their fans and hardwork they put in it. If have not got the album yet, go buy it right now."
0,This book is terrible,"I was reading a debate between Noam Chomsky and William Bennet on their new books, so I decided to buy them both. I won't review Mr. Chomsky's book here, but Mr. Bennet's book is terrible. I thought it was bad enough to actually write a review so other people do not buy this book. The message is basically, if you love your country, agree and support what your government does."
0,"A new decade for Mac, a new way to disappoint","There's not a lot to say about McCartney's first foray into the 80s other than ""whoops."" Paul tried for a DIY ethic like his solo entry into the 70s, but no amount of synthesizers or discotheque appeal can mask the weakness of most of the material. If he was going for Bowie-esque reinvention/trend-setting, he failed far worse than Bowie did during the same decade.Actually starts out pretty well with the funky stomp of ""Coming Up,"" the amusing ""Temporary Secretary,"" and the fun but empty blues ballad, ""On the Way,"" but the rest is about as spotty as it gets. If Paul wanted to try a new wave flavor, why not go all the way? Instead, he forces boring and schmaltzy ballads like ""Waterfalls"" and ""One of These Days"" upon us, and we're forced to cringe and wonder just what the hell happened. Nobody expected consistency from Paul, but dreck? You've fallen a long way, Mac.Best cuts: ""On the Way,"" ""Coming Up,"" ""Nobody Knows,"" ""Temporary Secretary,"" ""Bogey Music"""
1,"Not normally a sci fi reader, really like this book!","Although I am not really into the sci fi genre I found a lot to enjoy. The writing was clever and pithy and the futuristic conventions were extremely interesting. I liked how he didn't go on and on explaining some of the futurist concepts but just let the context clarify what he means. (A society that has no money, just ""Whuffie,"" an instantly readable rating of a person's credibility. Creative and thought provoking).By the way, if you enjoyed the Walt Disney World and humor aspects of this book you might also enjoy Deep Water by SV Date."
1,Portraits in Oil the Van Wyk Way - very helpfull,I found this book to be very helpfull. I hopeto benefit by it in my portraits. I throughly recommendthe book.
0,Ill be waiting too.....,"Thanks to all of you for your reviews. I was seriously thinking about buying this set, but after reading all the opinions here, Ive decided to wait for a better product from Paramount. It irks me to no end that they wont honor the Star Trek franchise, and clearly are once again milking the fans for anything they can. Ill buy the blu-ray set when they do justice to the series, not before."
0,LIKE WATCHING BLOOD DRY,"I rarely write reviews of anything, but it's only right someone warn the uninitiated about this god awful thing.""Ordinary Horror"" is bad on many levels. ""Professor"" Searcy reminds me of a failed writing professor trying too hard to impress. I'll spare you the details (something I wish he would have done) and tell you this is the most confounding, unexciting, poorly written novel I've read in years. Beware, alright.(Note: The title evokes the remarkably good ""Ordinary People"" from back in the 70's. This book isn't even in the same league.)"
0,On/Off switch broke after less than a year,"I liked this hair dryer a lot, but the on/off switch broke less than a year after I bought it. Would not buy again or recommend it."
0,ESSENTIAL LIFE CAPS,I thought I was getting The Vitamin Shoppe Essential Life multi vitamins which are rated a 5 star vitamin. These Country Life Essential Caps are rated 2.5 which I consider to be fairly worthless! I returned them to The Vitamin Shoppe here in my town.
0,HORRIBLE!!!!!,i received this game very defective!!! it didn't even work! it was horrible!! i do not recommend using this person! i was told on the summary that it was in very good condition and it wasn't it didn't even work on a fully charged DS!! it was a very horrible experience!
1,My fiance and I's favorite show,My fiance at first thought I just liked this show because I am a nerd but she is now addicted to this show. We both can't wait for more episodes to come out.
0,Closet Creationist idiocy.,"Behe does not realize that analogy is not a method of reasoning. His beliefs are clearly creationist, he just wont admit it. Instead he brings back a two-century old argument from design. His examples are few and stretched. Anyone with a background in molecular biology(or just a college education) would laugh at his evidence based on proteins. Its clearly a religious ploy to try and trick people into turning against one of the best proven theories in science. Dont forget, theory is the highest form of scientific truth! While Evolutionary theory will always be revised and improved, the core concepts will remain intact. Behe is trying to get us to believe that the entire foundation of a well proven theory is nonexistent, based on scant evidence and incorrect logic. Wrong Century Behe!"
1,Great tribute for an unbelievable band,"Listen, it will be short : if you love all grind songs of carcass, buy this cd !!! The production is good, but i think the master could have been better, so the sound is a little bad for some group."
0,this man cleary doesn't know what he's talking about,"just as the title says. I've done months and years worth of reserch, and about %40 of the book is a complete lie, i would not recomend this to anybody who is a first time mouse owner. For example, he says that mice are able to eat things that are potentually fatal; things like cheese,white millet, and other things. He Also doesn't tell you every thing a first time owner would need to know. I looked on the back of te book and found a biography about him. It says that he is a cat surgon, so he would probably know more about cats than mice. This man is cearly a complete idiot who should cave a stake and fall back on it."
0,Not for first-time Czech learner,"The lessons go by very fast, with each phrase spoken only once. In order to learn, you must either have a super-human ear and memory, or you must listen to the CD 500 times. The CD might be a good review for someone who has already learned the language, but for the first-timer, consider the Pimsleur method instead."
1,Awesome,"I have seen and heard corey live in concert. He is wonderful!!Sometimes you buy the cd's to replay what you heard in concert and it does not live up to the memory. Corey's music however, that is not the case. It is the best in person but the cd brings you back and it is extremely enjoyable. I own two copies myself, that way I have one for the car and one for the house. I'm sure I will be buying more in the future for gifts and a back up for when my children misplace my Cds.I definitely recommend the cd to any and all.A MUST for a classical music collection."
0,Waste of money!,"Getting the Twin Draft Guard into position to actually block the leak is a serious pain. Once the guard is in place, you won't want to use the door again because it slides completely out of position every time you open it. It comes out of the package all bent, and it takes a while just to get it straightened out enough to use. It may block the draft once in place, but the door must be open to reposition the dumb thing, and it takes at least two or three minutes each time. You probably loose more heat in this process than you block once the guard is actually in place. Worthless product - don't waste your hard-earned cash!"
1,just because of her.,I love the show and that is why I ordered it to catch up on what I have missed. But for me he is not the show she is!
0,Guns and Roses are awful!,"What can I say about these guys? They make the worst noise this side of Avril Lavigne! Appetite for Destruction is an album filled with every annoying rock cliche imaginable...whiney vocals that explode into raging screams, ""chunk-a-chunk-chunk"" guitars, and all those annoying cuss words in the lyrics that rely on shock value rather than musical quality to get their message across. OOOHH that's so SHOCKING and PROFANE!!! I""m so shocked that this band put out a song with swear words in it! *rolls eyes* This [...] isn't fit to listen to!"
0,Really cute ...,but that's about all it has going for it. The washcloth is really small and can't really be used for much of anything. The bib has a very small opening to go around the neck and my baby is only 6 months old and weighs in about 15 lbs and it doesn't fit her. Everything rolls right off of it and it cannot be used to wipe baby's mouth. I don't think I would recommend this product.
0,Its alright,"This is an ok video that shows how military music is performed in the United States, Brittan and France. The video was really short and did show the performances more than the narrator's voice offering explanations and information. It is an old video that was made in 1995 and could use some major improvements in the production but is worth watching if you have any interest for the music of the military. When looking at the title I was expecting more of a documentary of military music rather then watching a performance which is what I received."
0,Beware - this DVD player does NOT play DivX files!,"Contrary to what the product descriptions on samsung.com, amazon.com, bestbuy.com, etc. say, this DVD player does NOT play DivX files. I purchased this player almost solely based on the fact that it would play these files, but when I got home, it would not play them at all. I ended up calling 1-800-SAMSUNG and a CSR told me that the DVD-HD860 does not play DivX files, but that the DVD-HD960 does (and oddly enough, the product description for the DVD-HD960 does not mention this feature). Boo to Samsung for their incorrect product descriptions!"
0,Not what I thought it was,"Before I bought this CD, I listened to the samples and thought the CD was gonna be great. Turns out, that this CD is full of tunes that are so generic and repetitious that after the first minute of each song, you just get bored because it sounds as if the songs starts over again. Thackery doesn't really change the melody from one segment to the next and as a song progresses, it sounds as if he is running out of ideas. This is where things start to get right down dull and makes the CD a waste of money.Regardless of the great reviews this CD got, my opinion is that this CD deserves two thumbs down .... way down!"
0,Shuts down when any ink color is low!,"It should be noted that this printer will not work if any of the six ink cartridges runs out. I tried everything to get it to print, including cleaning all nozzles, and got nothing. I went to the basement and found my old HP 932C, which had sat unused for AN ENTIRE YEAR, and hooked it up to finish the job I was working on when the Epson threw its fit. The HP printed just fine, no problem. That should tell you everything you need to know."
0,CHEAP,"NOT ALL made in England, only a few pieces and the ones made in Malaysia look like $h!+. I have 10 settings made in England, wanted 12 but NOT from this place."
1,A Handy Item for Toddlers,"I've had and used this Bumkins Waterproof Sleeved Bib for 2 months on my now 18 month old and it works great at keeping her clean. In most cases I simply wipe it down with a wet sponge if she's spilled wet food on it and I've only felt a need to throw it in the washing machine 3 times. It is sturdy, washes well, dries quickly, is easy to put on and the butterfly motif is pretty. The long, cinched at the wrist, sleeves are great too.A must have that makes clean up fast and easy."
1,Great Results,No nonsense straight forward routines that range from 8-9 minutes or so and have been effective for me.Good to add this if you just want exercises that focus on your abs.
1,Love it!,Awesome...all of her tapes are awesome and this one is no exception! Love her and her works outs!
0,"not so good, no real point","I read this book, thinking that it might be entertaining. But it was SO slow! I felt that it never got to the point. When I finished the book I felt that there had been no real conflict and no real resolution. It had some fun moments, but I felt that the author was hoping to keep it open for a sequel and not enough attention was paid to this book."
0,Disc Error Messages,"The manual does not say what speed DVD-R/RW to use. I purchased Memorex DVD-R x8 and received a Disc Error Message. I then purchased DVD-R x4 and received same error message. I emailed customer support and waited two days for a reply. In the meantime I called customer support and was told only media x1 or x2 can be used. When I received the email message message from their support personel it said: "" DVD-R 4x can be used 8x will result in a disc error.DVD-RW 2x can be used 4x will result in a disc error.The following discs have been tested and are proven to be compatible with our DVD recorders.MEMOREX DVD-R FUJIFILM DVD-R FUJIFILM DVD-RW IMATION DVD-RWIMATION DVD-R 2.0 TDK DVD-RW 2X TDK DVD-R 2X""So, go figure. I spent a lot of money on DVD-R's that don't work. I'm returning the product rather than continually purchasing non-refundable DVDs. I now have 45 DVD-R's that are of no use to me. Thankfully, Amazon will refund the purchase price of this this player/recorder."
1,Good stuff,"I really like all the pieces that had a classical tint to them. I didn't care much the tracks that were too much like chemical borthers or some such things, but there were plenty of tracks that made up for those."
0,Stay Away,"Problems too numerous to detail here including bad prints, paper jams, warped tray. Too many other options out there to waste you time with Kodak. Customer service and repair is much below sub-par."
1,A must read book,"This book is a somewhat interesting story. Character chemistry or interaction are enough to keep a reader intrigued. It certainly lets us know what's like a cadet of Starfleet Academy regardless of gender, species, origin, etc. A lot of individual adentures are included into this book.Kudos to Susan Wright."
0,Mediocre at best,"I will not review this based on the book, as I was never a big fan of the book anyways, but on the film itself.Mostly, I simply found most of the characters to be bland and lifeless, with the notible exception of the villian Febre, and the plot and dialogue to be fairly weak and unexciting.The swordfighting skills displayed in the movie were dazzling, but (as another reviewer also mentioned) considering that everyone appeared almost identicle, it was a little hard to tell at times who was fighting whom. Also, while again the fight scenes were dazzling, there was no practicle reason why some of the more over the top ones were even engaged in. I am referring mostly to the fight outside the tower on ropes (why didn't someone attempt to cut D'Artagnan's rope instead of engaging him in an ariel fencing match?) and the fight on the ladders (why would Febre give up stable ground to fight D'Artagnan on unsure footing?)."
0,"Great light, when working","I purchased two of these.One is defective. It totally quit working right way.They are the coolest hand held flash light there is.The possibilities are almost endless.Like wearing tye-dye?... this light is for you.Make a trip whip! (I did this with one)Make a crystal display. (I made one)This light looks cool on any multi-colored surface. (posters and such)They are very cool lights if they work. Quality control could be much better.I am happy with the working one, extremely unhappy with the broken one.Expensive for one light.50% success rate here."
1,Get the right book!,"The book is written well, BUT be careful when you purchase this book that you are getting the full-length updated version of the book with the BLUE cover, as pictured in the Amazon offering page. There is a very small old pamphlet edition with a red and black cover that has exactly the same title floating around out there. Be sure that you are getting the FULL-length version with the blue cover!"
0,Disappointed,"The Companion 2 multimedia speakers have been a big disappointment. I had to put thecpu on the desk because the cord was too short. The speakers have a continuous weaving buzzing sound that aBose tech tried to eliminate by changing the power connection, but that was completely useless.The sound is good, but I have to recommend against the purchase of these speakers."
1,Be sure to get a FULL frequency transmitter like this one,"Before the Belkin, I tried 3 other FM transmitters that had 4 preset frequencies. None of them worked AT ALL. Maybe it's the area I'm in (large city, lots of FM stations), but the interference on the other units was horrible. I finally tried the Belkin and am much happier with it. It's not crystal clear like a radio station, but I get very little static and background noise. I can also change the frequency if weather, etc. interferes.June 2007: I've had a year to use this product now, and I would lower the rating to 3-4 stars if possible. Reason? Because the batteries do not last very long at all before I begin to hear more static (i.e. lose some signal power). I've found that I really need to use the cigarette lighter adapter for power. With it, though, I have no problems."
0,No Original Music...No Sale,"Music is as integral to this series as it is to Miami Vice, and we got the original soundtrack for that DVD without a huge pricetag. Sorry - without the same music it was created with, Tour is not the same show, and I can do without it."
1,Love this movie!!,"Great entertainment. Great performance. Great film. Includes the deleted scenes which makes better sense of things. Two thumbs up to Peter Jackson, and of course J.R.R. Tolkien for this great piece of work."
1,Wow,This the first book by Richard Laymon that I have read. Wow is all I can say. I will definitely be reading more of his work.
0,Poor Quality Plastic Piece will Break,"I purchased this 3 years ago and it broke about two years ago. I've been using it without a lid for too long now and so am shopping for a new one. You'll note the lid is attached by a plastic piece to the base. That piece will break, just how soon. Also the lifting mechanism often comes off track and you have to put it back together. I rate this one star for the poor quality for that plastic piece. An expensive trash can should last more than a year or two. Now it goes to a dump somewhere to biodegrade in a few hundred thousand years. Might actually use it for recycling bin in garage for a while."
1,The Battlestar Galactica theory.,Basically you can buy and read this book or buy the new 2000's version/remake of Battlestar Galactica and the show Caprica and watch them and see a visual interpretation of this authors theories. I like the t.v. show myself. The book is great. Buy it. But Battlestar is even better. That's it. John
0,Pills after the first wash,"I've never had a problem with sheets pilling before, so this was a first. 300 thread count is sort of wasted when there are hard little pills all over the surface. Also, the sheets are very thin."
0,Stale Stooges,"The enduring popularity of The Three Stooges is directly attributable to the 190 comedy shorts the team made for Columbia Pictures (1934-1959), particularly the 97 entries featuring Curly Howard as the third Stooge. While several of these classic comedies are available on DVD, a few non-Columbia Stooge curios have turned up, including this title.SWING PARADE OF 1946 is a low-budget musical produced by the lowly Monogram Pictures, starring Gale Storm and Phil Regan, with Moe, Larry and Curly providing comedy relief. Away from their home studio, the boys seem to be a little disoriented; worse yet, Curly is clearly in declining health (later that year he suffered a stroke that forced him to drop out of the act). Rabid Stooge fans may want to check this one out, although it's nowhere near the level of their best work. Casual viewers in search of the usual boisterous antics are advised to look elsewhere."
1,Learn more about this fascinating persona,"I fell in love last year. With Argentina. Having visited, I wanted to learn more and more. The musical Evita gave me a taste of the complexity of the fascinating story of one of Argentina's great figures. This book is a scholarly look at her life, her ups her downs, and includes many interesting photographs of Eva and Juan. I recommend it highly."
0,This book [isn't very good],"I don't know what this guy was smoking when he wrote it, or what the publisher was snorting when he signed this guy, but for christ's sake let's sterilize both of them to prevent this type of [garbage] from clogging our inputs."

0,Don't bother,"I'll keep it short--Don't bother. Compared to other recent games like Jedi Knight 2, etc, this game is 5 years behind the times. The game engine is a clunker and the controls do not allow you to respond at the same rate as your adversaries. The Tolkien Estate should be ashamed..."
1,love them,"I bought these 9 months ago and have gotten so much wear out of them. They are small, but very sparkly and simple. These are a great value!"
0,Get the full sized one instead,"I liked these little zippos years ago so i bought one again. Disappointment. Get the full size one instead. I have 3 of these small ones purchased from 3 seperate stores and they all suck. Full sized zippos work great in my experiance, carried them for years but for some reason the small ones don't work well."
1,"Shoe fits, well made and the right price.",I have worn Sebago Schooners for 20 years and found the price to be very attractive. The shoes wear well.
0,MORE LIKE UNPRACTICAL MAGIC,"I finished this book in about 3 days realizing that the only thing that was noteworthy was the fact I had lost 3 days in my life to which I could have been reading something that was worthy of my time rather than wasting my time on this book. I read the book and saw the movie at the same time. If Hoffman had written a book with the same heart as the movie, maybe then I would not be so harsh. Plus, did she even do any kind of research for this book? Being a Wiccian,I am very disappointed.This girl needs to learn a few things about magic and the occult before she writes a book on it!!!!"

0,The first foot steps for cordless headphones,"The first generation of Sennheiser Wireless headphones was just about OK if you did ot leave your livingroom and faced the transmitter......The RS 40 is deffinitelly better, however if you leave the room where the transmitter is placed and dare to go to the garden or one floor up the noise becomes unbearable.Wait for the 2.4 gigahertz version - The RS40 is not worth it.The cheapest corded headphones sound better."
1,The Blind Side,"This is a fine film and Sandra Bullock shows what a good actress she is. Comedy or drama, Sandra does well. Recommended."
0,Get the new eddition,"I saw this book in the store and decided to see if I could get it cheaper on Amazon. When I pulled up the page, the cover was the same as the one in the store. I didn't know it was an old eddition with outdated figures until it arrived in the mail. I went back to the page I bought it on and then noticed the disclaimer for the pictures being from the newer eddition. The newer book has different projects and more current prices."
0,Not as good as you'd come to expect,"State of Fear by Michael Crichton is a good read but doesn't rise to the top as his previous books. It's like reading prey from the nanobug's point of view with a super arrogant nanobug. I recommend you buy the paperback specially if you are a die hard Crichton fan like I am. That way you can enjoy tossing this book accross the room occassionaly as you read the erroneous one sided statements that are made throughout the book, and not put a hole in the wall. It did get my blood boiling a bit. I kept on wondering wether Crichton was being funded by the Bush administration. I still like the writing style...true to form. My first dissappointment with a Chrichton book."
1,A new favorite author,"Atkinson takes what seem like different, unrelated threads and brings them together in a wonderful bow. A great crime mystery, and Jackson Brodie is a unforgettable character. I have read the other three in the series and have the 5th on pre-order."
1,Great Movie,"This was the first time I watched the movie from beginning to end. It was great with suspense, action and love."
1,Brilliant comic,I bought this as a present for my boyfriend who had just been watching the tv series and he loved it. The art work is amazing and I'm sure he'll be buying more of them soon. Really great product.
1,A Departure from the Script,"This was a very good read, mostly believable, amusing in parts and certainly entertaining. I learned a few things about what religious Jewish people do to celebrate various occasions. Although I have some Jewish friends, none practice, so this was informative. I am not sure there are actually such things as female rabbis and religious gay marriages in the Jewish faith, but this was fiction. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was the silly sexual descriptions between the husband and wife, and the wife and her gay lover. Does the author really think readers need a description, in order to know what happens between two people? That was the only spoiler for me. Sex left to the imagination of the reader is so much better!"
0,Unwatchable,"With all the violence in the world, do we really need to sit through a movie where two women torture and beat the living daylights out of each other? I could not endure this flick to it's ""painfully ironic ending..."""
0,Tyrant's Guide.,"With such vicious ways mentioned on how to handle employees, I find it amazing that Jack Horn has managed to get the necessary supervisoral experience to write this book. But then again its not like the upper levels of management bother to listen to lowly employee's complaints about a tyrant of a boss.Although he does write some good info down on the basic chores of a supervisor daily, he is definitely stuck in the days of the Steel & Oil Tycoons where they would force their employees to work 60 hrs a week for peanuts.This book is really not a good source of information for a supervisor, unless he wishes to completely alienate his work staff, and cause a high job turnover rate, not too mention a lot of sabotage and theft on the job."
0,Became useless in 8 months and was never that good to begin with,"Since we bought it we were having problems, specially because my sister had a ""Jiffy"" I think (the one that costs 150 bucks) and we could compare and see that it was way better than ours, specially if you are trying some heavier fabric clothes, and I mean regular dress shirts, not jackets, jeans shirts or stuff like that. Now, about 8 months since we bought it (and we don't use it that much, as we have a cleaning lady that irons so it's only for emergencies) it has become completely useless, the steam connector is leaking so almost no steam comes out and it becomes a possible hazard.I've tried going for the cheap one, but now I'll have to go for the expensive one."
0,"disappointing muzak ""dub""","Disk one is not dub and it is not compelling. A better title might be ""Bombay Elevator Music."" Saccharine melodies and treacly arrangements make this sound like something one might hear in a shopping mall. I am also a fan of chill and ambient modalities, and this is neither of those either. On the upside, this is not music that will disturb the neighbors. Guaranteed never to break your chain of thought. One star for this half of the title.Disk two, on the other hand, is a collection of remixes of disk one material. This disk alone would be a three star album. Good beats, judiciously fat bottom end, cloying strings toned down and the treacle drained from the arrangements, it's a nice chill vibe that actually rises on occasion to dubness. Too bad it's not available as a stand-alone ""volume 2."""
1,back to school!,"Summer's ending, kids long ago gave up on doing workbooks & writing in their journals. What to do to get their brains in gear before schools starts up? I ask myself.Enter Brain Academy. Right now there are 4 kids aged 6-9 whooping it up on my Wii, doing some simple math & visual tasks - 2 of them have ""bigger brains"" than me, lol!Fun, good for a rainy day especially, and IMO much better use of time than many other ""games"" out there."

1,Katy's Review,This remote is very easy to use and requires no assembly or directions. Great product!
0,Not very good...,"Just to be frank this series was by far the worst thing I've ever bought. I had the feeling that yuri would be in here and all but this series focused so much on it, it made the rest of the anime parts really not matter at all. Plot wasn't too good, fights were mediocre even for the final battle. Thank goodness I did not buy this full price. I think I'll just sell this anime to someone who cared more for the yuri then anything else, since that's all this anime seemed to really focus on."
0,Below Par,"I have been using two different Tena products for the past several months and have found them comparable and maybe just a bit preferable to Poise. I decided to try a different type of Tena, but I am very disappointed in the Tena Serenity Pads. They are extremely uncomfortable and I will not be using the rest of the package (I have used one pad)."
0,Whiney and Boring!,"This book was 300 pages of girl meets navy boy. Girl doesn't want relationship with navy boy, because he's navy. Boy wants girl. Girl won't budge...he's navy (did I mention that already????). Girl falls in love with navy boy but knows it won't work...because he's navy. Girl tells boy goodbye, because he's navy. Boy pursues girl, but she says no, cuz he's still friggin navy.Gimme a break!!!!!! I can't believe a publisher paid this author for this crap."
0,I Was a Loyal AGFA Customer Until I Bought THIS,"I have purchased a number of digital cameras over the last 2 years, including one from AGFA, the ePhoto 307 (A great little camera). The ePhoto Smile is an Affront to the AGFA brand name. The pictures are awful, the battery life abysmal, and worst of all, it would be a bad deal at 1/2 the price. I recently bought my youngest daughter a Polaroid Digital 320. It takes much better pictures, and we're still working on the 1st set of batteries . . . .. In short, don't buy this camera. If you really want to take digital pictures it's hard to go wrong with the Olympus 340R for under $300."
1,Can't Keep the Listeners Down,"One of the best Rockin' n' Rollin' singer I've heard in a long time. To be honest I had never heard of Tommy Castro, but when I heard one of his songs on a various artists, Alligator Records CD, I had researched his work and found it to be awesome. He sounds a little like Delbert McClinton, in some songs. I can only describle his music as good Rock n' Roll. I have purchased several of his CD's. ALL GOOD!!"
1,Pretty Good...,"But i wouldn't read it if you aren't into fantasy, it got kinda confusing sometimes with the different worlds and weird places. Also, it gets a bit graphic, especially with Iorek and Iofer, but it was still a good book."
0,this is swolen,bob dyoan's greatest hits??? this guy don't have hits. That song about the tambouines that's a Captain Kirk song. and the ones with babe in them were stolen from sonny and cher. how come peeple thing this guys good when he dont got no original stuff to sing for us. no one shoud buy any of his regords becuz it only let s him get awayy with what he did here. hell do more and take away from sonny.

0,Doesn't work for everyone!,"After taking the four pills in the morning I was nauseated. At first it wasn't to bad, I thought I can handle this and continued to give it a try. However the nausea got worse and after two weeks I had to stop because I didn't want to feel sick every morning. I didn't notice any difference in my joints during the two weeks."
1,"Brilliant humor, very entertaining","This is a brilliant piece of work. The author has always been a favorite of mine. You will find this book easy to read. It will have you laughing out loud, so I would not read it in a quiet library. This is a book to read before bed, in the bath tub, if your frustrated, on your coffee break, waiting at the airport. Her tales of life experiences are fun to read or watch as it is part of her stand up comedy. I loved it."
0,Don't waste your money!,"This is not worth any amount of money. My husband is loosing his hearing and thought this would be exactly what he needed so that he could actually hear the tv without it being turned up as high as it could go. Not the case. There is alot of background noise with these headphones, no matter what level the volume is set at. He used it one time and its been sitting on the tv ever since. Do not waste your money on this product. Its not worth it."
0,Absolutely perfect!!!,"It fits absolutely perfectly into that small space in the back of my closet.I got better reception with the cheapo, non-powered rabbit ears, that are re-hooked to my TV.Save your money."
0,What happened?,"When I first read the Belgariad, I was enchanted. Great story, great characters, compelling from start to finish. The Mallorean had so many parallels to the Belgariad, but that was fine because it was incorporated into the story. Then came the Elenium, and I started to suspect that Eddings was a one trick pony. Too many similarities to previous efforts.Well, after reading Regina's Song, I'm going to say I wish he (and his wife) had just stuck to that one trick. A pretty cool idea was dragged into the mud by mind numbingly boring characters and execution. Some of the worst dialogue I've ever read; think noir meets Barbie. Finally, I was offended by the pomposity of the main character, who remains pugnaciously mundane to the highly unsatisfying end."
0,"Bitter, acidic","I really must disagree with the other two reviewers. I have found the aroma of this blend to be bitter, acidic and burnt. That carries over and makes for a pretty lousy cup of coffee. However, it isn't undrinkable and I suppose I'd put it on a par with what one would get from a cheap supermarket choice.Now, to be fair to Cafe Altura I want to note that there was air in my bag. I don't know if this is unusual or if they do not vacuum pack their beans (which would lead to oxidation fairly quickly and hence the bitter aroma)."
1,THE BEST GAME EVER! The Whole Family can Play,I was introduced to Quelf this weekend and I just purchased 3. They will make awesome gifts. They are great for Church groups and friends. But Make sure you have a camera ready because you will want to remember everything. The rule card is my favorite. We pinched each other after every turn and it became so funny. Dancing and laughing! If it is Random fun you are looking for you must get this game! It will become a family tradition!This is a must have for every family!
0,Warning: This is not AYN RAND.,"Like any great artist, Ayn Rand has her share of people who are trying to cash in on her success. This book is a shining example of that. If you want to read about Ayn Rand then read her books. If you want to read about Ayn Rand's views on feminism then read Return of the Primitive. This book has no claim to fame other than the two words, Ayn Rand, printed on its cover. This is not Ayn Rand."
0,This was a terrible book,First of all it was very boring. It just made me want to go to sleep. It might have been a little better had the author not made Amanda's so extremely annoying. She never seemed to shut up and the endless ramblings of the a few of the stories characters just make this one of the worst books I have ever read.
0,DO NOT BUY FOR DIAPER RASH!!!,"Do not buy if it is for your baby as diaper rash cream!!!!! The formula (and product packaging) has changed as of Feb 2011!!! I am posting this to forewarn all parents. I had been using the ""original"" formula since November 2009 and just went out and ordered 5 more 14oz tubs. Guess what? not only has the packaging changed, but the formula is totally different and WORSE!!!!It is now 30% lanolin (as opposed to 50%) and now contains a chemical called Disodium EDTA which is likely NOT good for your baby. STAY AWAY and don't buy anymore!! I'm so mad, b/c the original formula worked and i was going to use it forever. Warn your friends the formula has changed!! So important!!!"
0,Never again,"I bought these along with several other pair from the same place. All of which fell apart within minutes of wearing them. The stones fell out of at least one earring of each pair. Seriously? Four pair of earrings and they all lost stones? I was sucked in by the low price for sterling silver and I got stuck with what I paid for. While the company was willing to refund or replace the item with no issues, I would never buy anything from this place again. I could accept one pair falling apart. Things happen. However all 4 pair falling apart doesn't say much for the quality of their items. I've bought silver from several other places with no issues in the quality department. If you choose to purchase these, I suggest you check the prongs and the stones to see if they are loose and try to crimp the prongs to retain the stones."
1,Fantastic,"My first Jenkins novel & I can only hope I find other works of hers as good as this one. I was concerned about setting taking place in such an old time period, but thankfully found that it did not impact the story negatively. The uber-romantic story line was perfect and just amazing. It had surprising spunk and wit & I frequently found myself cracking up out loud. This book somewhat reminds me of Zane's classic Addicted; this story was clearly not as raunchy, but boy was it hot hot hot! But it reminds me of Addicted due to the amazing story line that grabs you & won't let go. I stayed up until 7am to finish this book, it was so good. Excellent story, excellent."
1,A big hit,"I'm surprised at the negative reviews based on the web site. I've managed two of the Ceiva frames for almost a year now, regularly sending back pictures from Europe and Africa, with no failures or major nuisances. They've even saved me a lot on international phone calls of the ""Arrived OK"" variety, what with local web access numbers and overnight delivery. The Ceiva web site has improved quite a lot in that period but was never problematic.The frames themselves work well, much better than the 640x480 screen resolution would suggest. I think they traded resolution for brightness, and you can usually see the pictures from across the room, even at non-optimal angles. The resolutely-nontechie parents love them. I always crop pictures and resize them before uploading (the simplest shareware programs suffice, though I use Photoshop for more extensive ""darkroom work"")."
1,Pretty good stuff,"This book, which is loosely based upon a real event in the USSR, has a unique setting and characters. Once it got going, it reminded me of a good Stephen King book that wouldn't stop until the last page! I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a non-traditional story with a lot of suspense!"

0,Lets do Lunch... another time!!,"Well, Im going to be honest. I havent read this book because I received it with pages and pages of Corrections included with the book. Before I read this book, Im supposed to go through and make ALL of these changes to certain paragraphs. I paid full price for the book thru the Let's Do Lunch"" web site so that I could edit the whole book..... I dont think so. My mistake.I dont know if there is a way to find out if the book you are ordering is mistake free, but I would try to find out before you place your order or waste your time."
1,Gorgeous Lotion,"I love this lotion. It's the first time I bought a lotion that goes on light, smells great, and lasts all day, but is not heavy. I used the whole jar up and ordered another."
0,Very limited appeal,"This book COULD serve a purpose, but only for those who have not yet kissed and/or are under the age of 15 or so. For those, the general information contained in this book, while a bit old-fashioned and repetitive, could be of some use.For others, however, it will accomplish little. Almost all of the ""special"" kisses contained in the book are either already widely practiced or self-explanatory and useless. ""What is a surprise kiss?"" ""It's when you are surprised by a kiss."" ""What is a grudge kiss?"" ""Its when you kiss someone else after being cheated on."" These are not new kisses, they're simply kisses grafted on to outside circumstances.The advice tends to be constant repetition that boys should slow down, focus more on lip-only kissing, and try to be romantic. Girls should make it clear to the boys that they like that they are interested in kissing them.Hopefully that saved you a few dollars."
1,Long Awaited and Greatly Appreciated,"Ms. Fox, how I missed your music. Not receiving the deserved respect in the U.S. but recognized throughout the world. This latest album took awhile to hit the states and though not many were ordered by retailers, loyal Samantha Fox fans snapped them up quickly. Every song is a treat. Ms. Fox's voice has matured and is even better that her early days in the late 80's. I can't wait for her next record. Thank you SAM!!!!"
0,"not for ages 4-8, for much younger",The age range listed on amazon for this book is extremely misleading. I bought it for my 7 year old nephew and it's more appropriate for my 2 year old daughter.
1,WIDE ANGLE LENSE - INEXPENSIVE,"I received the lense within a reasonable time. The lense has a wider view, though I don't have other lenses to test it against. The lense came with the adapter necessary for my Sony camera and everything fit together just fine. Overall I am very satisfied and if I had to decide again I would by the same lense."
0,My cats won't use it.,"They may dislike the feel of the pellets. Also, they do manage to track the stuff, dirty, around their litter pans. Not something I will inflict on them again."
0,Not worth it...,"If you're expecting great performances from the name listed, don't...if you're expecting to witness the ""real"" spring break, don't. most of the dvd just shows girls in their bikini's dancing to reggae music. now i love reggae, but if i wanted to watch girls dancing around and every once in a while flash the camera (this dvd is censored by the way) then i would've rather bought a girls gone wild dvd. don't buy this for the live performances either, not worth it. get another live performance dvd."
1,Excellent,"Just finished this book and didn't want it to end. Hard topic, yes, but such a wide view and a compelling one. This book is rich and engaging and full of the world itself. It's true - there are many voices to follow, but dip in and you will find yourself on a voyage unlike any other. The language is beautiful, the characters are so true, the sadness is profound, and the irony/humor is sharp. I found myself pulling for one character and then another. Even the hardest characters (""Mary"") grew in my affection. It took a sea-going ship sailing across the world to show all the bits of humanity. Wonderful."
0,I Would Like To Hear Mr. Legg Play A Real Acoustic!!!!,"Adrian Legg is an incredibly gifted player there is no doubt about that, but I think he relies to heavily on effects to do the playing. Like for instance the song ""Psalm With No Words,"" that song would have been great without his guitar all phased/chorused out. It sounds terrible! He also needs to work on playing less, because he tries to put too many chords/notes in a phrases and it just doesn't sound that great. His songwriting is okay, but I think his playing shouldn't overshadow the song. The song should always come first.Many of his albums are lacking in the creativity department simply because he tries too hard to somehow inject his songs with an over usage of technique. He should really let the song speak for itself and not subject his listeners to his effects and overbarring guitar technique(s).I like Adrian Legg, but I'm not going to subject myself to him, unless his music starts to speak for itself."
0,I always called it Suddently Susan.....,It was the writing and the acting. I never thought it was that good.But that will likely not stop it from coming to DVD. Anyway to make a fast buck.
1,"Not as good as ""BE""","...But still very good. While it's hard to top ""BE"", this album could've been better. The first half of the album is way better than the last half. Plus the new version of ""so far to go"" ain't as good as the original on the J Dilla's album. Still a great record though..."
1,A Painted House - down the road,"I was so very excited about the A Painted House when I heard about it. The story takes place just down the road from where I grew up. Black Oak, Ar. is about 4 miles from my families farm. Mr Grisham's family owns the land next to my Dad's so you can understand my excitement. The book was very well written as are all of his books and it brought back many memories of my childhood. I even learned some things I did not remember. I look forward to each new book John Grisham puts out, as each one seems to be a little better than the last."
1,sMASHing!,"This is my all time favorite show. The DVD collection is incredible. My only question is an often asked one though. Why does it take so long to produce more seasons? They have them all. Why not produce them faster?! I can't wait for the second season. My wife use to hate the show. Now she loves it!! I want more, NOW!!!!"
0,weird,I felt that this was a fantasy novel with a tiny bit of sensuality in it. It was more about surviving the future than relationships. What little intimacy there was wasn't even hot.
1,Every Which Way but Loose- Clint Eastwood,I bought this as a gift for my Dad. The price was very reasonable and I received it even sooner than i expected. The service is great.
0,Nothing good about this book,"No new information in this book, waste of your time and money, there are better books on this subject available. I returned it the next day to Amazon."
0,Disappointing and Amateurish,"The unconvincing plot, shallow characterizations and inaccurate editing would have been embarrassing for an amateur. I am left wondering if the real plot is to discover who wrote this. It can't be the same Dick Francis I have enjoyed year after year."
1,vrry good,"i am so far impress with the image quality, there are problems but it is a good deal for the price cannot beat hat,"

0,Not worth the paper it was printed on.,If you want a book with better house plans just go to your local grocery store and buy any of the plan books there. It should only cost you a few bucks and you will find hundreds of better ideas than this book contains.
0,Hand Book of dimensional measurement,I really didn't like this book. It really does not offer any real good info on how to master measuring instruments. It glosses over different types of instruments with out really telling one how to use them. I can not recommend this book
1,How did all these people get in my room?,"I am a 19-year-old HUGE Sinatra fan (rare enough), and I would consider this CD the soundtrack of my life. ""I've Got a Crush on You"", ""You Make Me Feel So Young"" and ""Where or When"" are perfect, and ""Come Fly With Me"" is awesome. It wasn't the first- or last- of Frank's CDs that I bought, but it is still my favorite. My favorite song (My Way) is missing, but ""My Kind of Town"" is there... and being a Chicago guy, that's good enough for me. And for a real Sinatra fan, he can talk about the ""Bayonne Baccalas"" all he wants. A legend."
1,TRIP PLANNING DVD,"This is NOT the film that plays at the museum! That film is ""Rt. 66 AN AMERICAN ODYSSEY"" by the same film company that made this ""how-to"" plan a trip VHS. This film is included on the ""Odyssey"" DVD version and the DVD is what you should get if you want the most information."
1,Very Happy,"Good price, free shipping, fast delivery, high quality.I use these in my Porter-Cable gun. Work perfectly every time. I ordered a second and third box."
0,Poor quality,I installed the oil cooling lines on my 1994 Chevy pickup using the Dorman Products # 625-107 and 625-108 cooling lines in February of 2007. They are both leaking again. I thought I would have better luck using an aftermarket product vs. a Genuine GM part (which I used the first time they leaked). I am disappointed in the short lifetime of the Dorman parts. We'll see how good their limited lifetime warranty is when I submit a claim.
1,Fun stuff,"This game was fun and challenging and getting your liscense to hit the road let smooth driving begin. The mini games weren't as fun but i enjoyed evreything about it. I'd say rent this game before you buy it,it may not be evreything you hoped for.But don't take my word for it."
1,Cool Crooners sound pretty good,"I got to hear the Crooners at the Lotus Festival this year in Bloomington, IN. Blue sky refers to the view one of the band members had from prison. That song and the rest of the ambum is very easy to listen to. The Crooners have a similar sound to the Mahattan Transfer. They sing in their native language so I don't understand a word. It is a pretty good cd."
0,I spent more money to see this film then they did to film it,"William Shakespeare must have been turning over in his grave after what they did to his popular tale. I have never been a fan of Romeo and Juliet (I think Hamlet is much better) but even I know the butchering of a classic play when I see one. Leonardo and Claire are good actors, and in this peice of trash they play a modern-day Romeo and Juliet. Even though it is set in the nineties, they still stick to the original script, even though half of it is cut for the sake of those who get tired of Shakespeare, (why they get tired of him, I don't know).Now I know that Hollywood has had some pretty bad follies before, but this film is beyond the area in which I draw the line. They should be ashamed of themselves. If you have to watch a version of ROMEO AND JULIET I'd highly reccomend either WEST SIDE STORY or the Franco Zefferelli version."
1,Excellent Thanksgiving book for young children,This book is an excellen choice for young children. I would recommend it for 3 to 6 year old children.
0,bogus baptism belief,"Our local used bookstore had copies of several of Jong's books. After reading them, I can see why. The sellers obviously found out that Jong is teaching a confusing, misleading message, and no longer wanted to have any part of him or his teachings.Jong's premise is that it is essential to one's salvation and freedom from sin(s) that one believe that it was in His baptism by John that Jesus took (""washed"") away and took on Himself the world's sins before finally carrying them to the cross. This ""water and Spirit"" baptism doctrine is a confused misreading of the New Testament. Neither the New Testament nor any of the Church Fathers taught this.In the guise of freeing his readers and followers from a ""works righteousness"" gospel, he instead burdens them with a quirky correct-belief-according-to-Paul-C.-Jong gospel.What other confused Christianities can we expect to come from the East?"
1,Definitely worth the 4 bucks! seriously,I havr a pair of Klipsch earbuds and I had the plug go bad so I looked for a replacement. I tried both the screw and solder terminal versions of the gold plug replacement from radion shack but the don't really hold the wire still after attached and didn't feel solid. This on the over hand was relatively easy to solder and with the extra support that pinches the wire its a lot better. Still great quality sound as long as you make the proper preparations (burn/scrap/sand off enamel of wires etc). Definitely worth the 4 dollars to save me over 80
1,Great buy!,"This product is a great deal for cloth tape. This is my second box and it is much more cost effective than purchasing one or two rolls at a drugstore or grocery store.The tape sometimes ends in the midst of a roll, but this has never been a problem."
0,this cd sucks,"at the reccomendation of a friend, i heard this was the best vandals cd...i had heard a song or two on comps, and figured sure....ill just buy it. this cd is the biggest waste of plastic in the world, thier lead singer is like 35, balding, and still sings about silly juvenile things. what a horrible cd. sounds like alternative trying to rock...oooh no."
1,"Zoom, Zoom Zoom!","If you would like to get shots like you may have wished for in the past, you can do it now with the SP-550UZ. The 18X zoom get you in there. I was fortunate enough, and patient enough to watch an Antalope mon with her two young ones, about six months old. I saw sone activity and focused in and got me a fantastic shot of those two young fawns dipping under mom and starting to nurse. WOW! I'll say if you want to get close, and closer, get a good camera with a large number zoom. The SP-550UZ 7.1MP Digital Camera with Dual Image Stabilizer 18X Optical Zoom is doing it for me. It can do it for you too."
0,Do Not Buy,Absolutely incredible boring movie with no thought put into the story line and plot. Boring characters .A Complete waste of money and time.
1,I now understand the Elmo rage,"This set was a gift from my 4-yr-old son's favorite auntie, and within a couple weeks we knew every line by heart. He just loves Elmo and the whole cast, who are each exciting and interesting as only a little, red, furry monster can be to a child. (Wait ... that's another episode ... involving a parade ...)Anyway, Elmo is a great educational tool and my son's personal favorite character in the known universe ... well, it's a tie between Elmo, Mr Noodle and Dorothy. And since my son has only been in the U.S. for two months and doesn't speak much English yet, that is definitely saying something.My highest recommendation."
0,Not a good textbook,"I would not recommend this textbook to someone who wants to learn the FUNDAMENTALS of C++. The textbook does not really cover the basis of algorithms and how to structure your code. It simply gives brief explanations to principles, and provides a few examples of sample computer codes. Don't waste your time and money with this textbook."
1,Fantastic singing.,"The singing on this recording is fantastic!The singer sings so brilliantly and his voice has power and flexibility. This recording makes for wonderful listening, and I'll be buying another CD as I've worn out this one listening to it over and over. Worth buying 2-3 more Cds."
0,Sorry to say,"This game is alright I suggest getting Oblivoin for computer or xbox 360But if you must have this game you should pick up Fable the lost chapters wich does make the game better but normal fable sucks it finished the story in 8 hours even with side quest. Oh and for who think that after beating it you will get to play on are wrong, well mostly.After beating the game I find out that there is absolotly nothing to doSo If U realy want this game get the expantoin versoin wich has both games fable and the expantoin Because if you pick up this game.get ready to be dissapointed"
0,"""Live in Concert""???","I was so looking forward to see the concert of the amazing cd of La Luna. So it was with utter amazement and disappoint that it was obvious that she was miming this concert. The question one has to ask is why try pass this off as a ""live in concert""when it clearly is'nt.Brightman has a unique voice but watching her going over the top trying to mime made me cringe.I will look forward to a Brightman concert where she actually sings."
0,The Emperors new clothes,"This book was a waste of money. Not only were the tips and tricks vague and largely incorrect, judging from the Authors images, he did NOT spend any time learning this program. He did, however, manage to acquire images from the Bryce list from some of the better Artists. Personally, if I had been employed with Metacreations, I would have paid him NOT to publish this book. Save your money, buy Susan Kitchens book"
0,"Metallica?, what is metallica?","If you think limp bizkit was bad enough, this dreadful album, might you want to think to rehash some songs like master of puppets, Jason newsted and james hetfield have presence but lars ulrich is wasted , looking like scott stapp in a dummer suit and kirk hammet looks like a raggae dancer and goes over the top and the whole cd (with brother reload) and s&m, plays more like britney spears than metal, take my advice metallica fans do not buy after 91 metallica albums (except garage inc), this is an ingenious exercise in pointlessness, Metallica, how about Nsynctellica."
1,Scratch---Don't Sniff,"The always versatile Shure SC35C, providing just what the novice DJ needs to kick some breaks and scratch for days. If you are looking for a stylus that can do it all, this is the one for you. So put that needle on the record and get to cuttin'..."
1,Great collectible!,"I bought this Barbie entirely as a collectible so she is still entact in her box. She is a beautiful Barbie and I wasn't disappointed when I received her, I am hoping to pass this down to my children."
0,Disappointing,"The Dolby sound is awful; in fact, you can't even hear some of the dialogue on the dvd."
0,"Overtaken by events, do not waste your money",After I read the book I Google Michael Scott Speicher. He never survived the initial crash and his body was recovered in 2009 which means the entire book was speculation that was proved to be wrong. The book is the perfect example to the fact that you can see whatever you want to see in a set of data or events.
1,There is not enough Batman...,"I must say that the animation work is great and you going to see a Batman like you see him in Comics, with great detail and excellent development, however the price to pay is that you don't get enough of this version of Batman. With the exception of the first episode, which is, also the most ""diferent"" of the conceptions of Batman, the all others are great job... so great that at the end of each chapter, they keep you waiting for more... which is a little frustrating, because there is no more.However, if you are a true fan of Batman, you should get this one, it's a great job."
0,Mars needs Moms Blu ray,"What the second reviewer overlooked is that the Martians KILL yes KILL the mothers after they suck the life out of them. This plot point was not needed. This movie is NOT about family values. The reason it failed is because it's a bad movie. John Lassiter, what were you thinking?PS I would be horrified if I had a kid there at the movies who had to witness a Mom getting the life sucked out of her until she explodes(dies). Think about it. If you liked that I bet you liked Eight Below where half the sled dogs freeze to death. Another Disney non Family values movie."
0,Look cool- but functionall Crappy- Poor battery Life,"I wanted so bad to like this company. Seemingly cool looking products. I like design, and Vessels products have the aesthetic I'm after. I bought the 4-set of Candelas in the Moma store in NYC, after charging them for 24 hours, 2 of the 4 did not work for longer than 3 minutes. I returned them to the store. 3 weeks later, 2 of the new Candelas started diminishing 10x faster than the other 2. I then contacted Vessel, who was surprisingly unfriendly and not very helpful. After a vigorous letter, I received 2 replacement Candelas (i marked them on the bottom) which lasted- get this- 2 weeks before fading out after 10 minutes. I sent the whole thing back to Vessel - who told me without the original receipt, could not refund me. I promptly told them to keep them. Terrible business practices, and useless product. How can a company like this stay in business>?"
0,NOT what I wanted,Do NOT buy this if you are looking to sing the music. There is NO piano part. Very dissapointed.
1,Penny Nichols finds a clue,Love it!!! Did not want to put it down!!! A good wholesome story. I would recommend this to any one who want to read a good old fashion book!
1,A Good Deal,"I've used other desktop ""Tower"" fans and this is the best so far. It's very quiet and the controls are easily accessed on top of the unit. You can't get a better deal for the $."
1,Great For Young Kids,"A silly movie I loved as a kid. I bought the DVD for myself. I put it on ready to enjoy a childhood favorite, and I could sit through it once and only once. Not quite as good as I had remembered, as with many things loved in childhood. My daughter on the other hand loves it, so not a total waste. Since I loved it as a kid and now my daughter loves it, I would say it's a great movie for kids. It's very entertaining for them. As for adults or young adults, unless you loved it as a child, there's not much of a plot but no shortage of cheese. The enjoyment is more sentimental and nostalgic. It's Jim Henson puppets, I mean really, how many serious adults sit around enjoying Sesame Street.No, there's nothing perverse about the movie (as I read in some reviews). And no, you don't have to be on drugs or crazy to enjoy it, just young or young at heart accompanied by a great imagination."
1,broad and indepth coverage of terms,Attractive display: both broad and indepth. The easy-to-find terms are numbered according to the number of letters; terms of general interests are given a box to themselves. Usually more terms per word than any other dictionary I have consulted. Get the hardbound for easier reading.
1,dog toy,my boy loves it and plays with it all the time. I would recommend to everyone. What a great product!
1,Very Accurate BP Monitor!,"This monitor is very accurate,and for the past month has been within 5 points of my doctors mercury blood pressure monitor. The only drawback: it cannot store independent data for two persons,which may be ideal for couples. The hand positioning sensor is also a great addition that improves the accuracy of the readings.I would highly recommend this monitor to anyone."
0,A call to arms rather than a diet book,"This book has very little to do with dieting and much more to do with attacking the ranching industries and promoting a vegan lifestyle. It attempts to gross the reader out with images of eating ""carcasses"" and sucking on your mother's breast in order to convince the reader that meat and any of its byproducts are unhealthy. This book is a bait and switch and a complete waste of time and money. If I wanted a book on the politics of the meat industry, I would have bought one."
0,"A cheap, plantation, redneck, ""CARRIE""","Hmmm, this was a horrible novel. It's like rich, plantation owner, meets a ""carrie white"" from backwoods alabama. It is horribly unoriginal, written on a second graders reading level...the most complicated word was probably telekinesis...however, the deaths were slightly exciting."
1,Great item,"I recently bought this item and I am quite happy with it. If you buy an Apple Cradle it's about $40 and add a USB 2.0 5-port Hub (which by the way most of them are really ugly and only 4-port) for $20 it's already a bit higher than buying this single device that helps you avoid clutter on your desktop as well.Pros: no cable clutter, slim design, cradle for ipod and usb 2.0-hub, audio out, usb 1.1 and 2.0 compatible.Cons: The leds on the front are a bit flashy for my taste, ipod re-connects and goes to ""do not disconnect"" mode every time I power up any other ac-powered devices connected to the hub.Overall: Good device, great price."
0,Quit while you were ahead,"Glad I didn't shell out money fot this one. After hearing it several times my mind kept wandering back to memorable tunes from her Come Away With Me album, and wondering where the memorable ones here are. Very unfulfilling. Her first was so good, so please quit while..."
0,The little white horse,"Based on a storyline from the 1800's, this book, in this day and age, is verging on child pornography, child neglect and promiscuous language. I can see its value for literary purposes with much expressive language, however, the heroine of this book is 13yrs old at the beginning of the book, is treated as a child throughout, the story advances by just days at a time and yet in the end she marries in the next spring at the age of 13 or 14yrs. Some of the language used is so 1940's and has developed alternate meanings over the time frame of 60+ years. Some very good escapist scenes, however, it will be interesting to see what they do to this novel to clean it up for the 21st century movie that is planned. When there are so many other thousands of good storylines to choose from, why did movie makers choose this one?"
1,This motion picture is dedicated to the massacre victims in Aurora Colorado,"The news was heard all around the globe when The Dark Knight Rises opened in theatres in late July the 20th, there was this bloody shootout inside the auditorium. There was one survivor whom I believed was playing dead, that was cool and smart thinking; but let us not forget the victims who did not make it out alive, for we are truly sorry for the loss of lives in that one single night.I am not exactly a Canadian, I am from London England. Doesn't matter, quite honestly, I was pretty darn scared myself if I went to see the movie on opening night, so I just told my friends and sibling that I was scared myself, knowing that The Dark Knight Rises was truly a masterpiece, last one in the trilogy and not to be missed. Amen."
1,"Touches not only the heart, but the soul......","This was her first book I've ever read and then I picked up each one of her's that I could get my hands on! Every scene is magical and mostly in its reality. It tells us as to how every turn our life ultimately takes us as to where we were meant to be all along. You fall in love with each character, each emotion and each memory. It is the most precious book in my collection, which taught me a lesson: ""When you are flat on your back, there is nowhere to look, but up."" Thanx to Susan Elizabeth Phillips, who kept me up all night, crying and laughing, and taught me true perseverance. A must read for all those who'd love to fall in love. These characters were made for us!"
0,Everything old is new again,"The Matrix takes on a future world where mind experiences are induced by software, not the senses. This premise ought to have been fascinating, but this very Hollywood treatment is nothing but an old fashioned shoot-em-up, with silly kung fu fights, hilarious logical inconsistencies, and a cinematic superhero who, true to formula, finds his magical powers just in time. Ho hum. Skip this one unless you like assault rifles discharging ammo by the bushel."
1,Just what you're looking for!,"MUSE is such an amazing band, extracting pure melancholy from the heart and transforming it into musical form. SHOWBIZ, the bands first album, is remarkably diverse and intricate. Kicking off the CD is ""Sunburn"", and one can not ask for a better opening track. Every track on here is worth the money. ""Muscle Museum"" and ""Fillip"" prove the emotion and passion that is rooted within Matt's voice and the bands overall talent. Other beauties such as ""Falling Down"", ""Cave"", and ""Overdue"" round out the exquisiteness of such an album. I cannot praise this enough! Muse is without question one of the best bands today. You will not be disappointed!"
0,Bitter,"I wish I hadn't read this book. I was always in awe of Chyna and the power and confidence that she portrayed. However, after reading this book, I now realize that she is nothing but bitter and sarcastic about her accomplishments and fame. Almost every sentence had sarcasm in it as well as bitterness towards each event in her life. I finished the book and my whole attitude towards Chyna had been tarnished. I am not proud of her anymore. I feel like she is who she is now just to spite something or someone. And that is just not respectable at all."
0,Warning! Its candy!,I don't believe these are real strawberries. I think this product is made from strawberry pulp + sugar + who knows what. They seem like slightly more healthy strawberry gummy bears candy.
0,Wrong Product,I was sent a left handed holster when I ordered a right handed holster. I have no means of sending mail back because of my loction in Afghanistan. I have complained twice on this specific order and still heard nothing from the seller. Very dissatisfied with the product and service.
0,Almost as bad as my old Samsung,This phone could have been a great phone but it was a prototype. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE. Buy the 650 and choose Verzion. Sprint's a joke. I've tried them three different times and this was my last time.
0,It's not a very good product,I think this product is too complicated to use. There are too many not so useful features. I had to return it after trying to use it.
0,Not so good,The quality on this was not what I expected for the money.It works but I just thought it would have been made better
0,Great keyboard unless.....,".....you use a KVM switch between 2 computers. I currently use a Linksys KVM2KIT switch with my Logitech Elite USB keyboard and my USB Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer. I have them plugged into the switch with PS2 to USB adapters. They've worked flawlessy from day one this way. I can plug the Gamer's Keyboard into the switch this way and it will not work at all. The saving grace is that it can be used on either of my machines as a stand-alone keyboard, but this just isn't my configuration. Unfortunately I'm going to have to RMA this keyboard. Just beware of this if you use a permanent switch."
0,4 matches cant save this.,"2 1/2. Some matches were great, match of the year candidates but Backlash 2002 is just not worth buying.1.Cruiserweight championship: Billy Kidman vs Tajiri W/torrie.10/10 , amazing cruiserweight action here!2.Bradshaw vs. scott Hall 3/10:Whats this?!?3.Womens championship:Trish vs. Jazz 1.5/10 Not as good as their past matches.4.Brock Lesner vs. Jeff hardy 4/10 this was a push match for Brock to showcase his stuff.5.Edge vs. Kurt angle 8.5/10 Great match with great ending.6.Intercontinental Championship: Rob van Dam vs.Eddie Guerrero.

1,I say!,"The mysteries being written for children are a tad easy to figure out and the language is a bit too jolly for me. Nearly every other sentence uttered by one of the Five Find Outers contains an ""I say--"" which is as bad as the Hardy Boy's over use of ""golly."" Nonetheless, a very enjoyable read."
0,hate this camera,"I bought this camera after the Ricoh I had for 8 years broke. I have taken 5 rolls of pictures in two months and am not happy with any of them. I keep trying, but I can't seem to take a good picture. They are either dark or fuzzy. The red-eye reduction feature takes too long. By the time the camera actually takes the picture, my kids have turned away. But without the red eye reduction, everyone's eyes are big and red. I never had a problem with my Ricoh. Every picture came out perfect so I don't think it's my fault. Anyways, I'm returning this camera and searching for a new Ricoh!"
1,Typical Snowmen Fun,I love the snowmen books! They have limited text and allow children to make up the story as they look at the book.
1,Wish fulfulled.,"The album isn't what I wanted. I wanted the song desperado. Love that song. I have heard the album and it's good. They are so surprizing in their music. One really has to hear it to believe it. They are an American band that isn't afraid to try on different sounds, breaking in a culture different from their own. It's a soild ablum, and really fun to listen to. If your into surprises, and philosophy this album is for you. They go deep lyrically, and mix in a shocking, fun vibe of sound."
0,DJ Shadow goes Rap; Beasties go Chill-out?!?!?,Both are a let-down at the same time.Check out 'POW' from The Broun Fellini's instead.~!an
0,Boring & uninspired,"When I first heard ""Le Champagne"" & ""In Progress"", both released on one 12"" on the west coast based Naked Music label..I was completely blown away.For me, they are the best house tracks i've heard in the last 20 years...hands down.I was hoping his other material was in a similar vein, but alas..it's NOT.This album has no developed musical ideas. All the tracks sound like ideas that were never fleshed-out and turned into actual pieces of music.Please Trentemoller...do some more tracks like ""Le Champagne""!!!!"
1,Interesting and helpful book,"I found this book easy to read, entertaining and very helpful to learn about ADHD. I know I would like to read more on the topic but having the story told firsthand from a person with ADHD made me change my mind about children like the author.I'm very happy I had the opportunity to read this book!!!"
1,Great book (4 1/2 stars),"The book was entertaining and a quick read, although I was a little confused because the book seemed more about Evelyn and less about everyone else. Jasmine and Malone were discussed, but Evelyn was the star of the book. The original caller was never discussed again. But Malone's character was the most satisfying. I'd read it again and definitely worth buying."
0,Wanted: A Groove of My Own,"This is not the worst album I've ever heard, but it is an album I have heard several hundred times before I actually popped it in my disc player. Jenny has a decent voice, and the backing tracks are professional, but Jenny is still lacking her own voice. Listen closely: There's a little Natalie Merchant there, a bit of Alanis there, and a sprinkle of Counting Crows over there. Her songs often follow the same patterns, and her vocal choices tend toward the gimmicky. Jenny has an excellent chance to evolve, but this album is sad evidence that she might be too busy following in others' footsteps to forge her own trail.Too bad."
1,Mosaic Tea Box Gift Set Simple Yet Wonderful,I gave this as a gift to someone very close to me and she was very happy. She told me that taste and quality is very very great.
0,Very Durable But...........,"This toy chest is exactly what we were looking for. It is very large to store plenty of toys and the top detaches. The problem is it was extremely difficult to assemble. In fact, I almost returned it because the sides just wouldn't connect. After trying several times and using a hammer and sitting on it, we managed to get 3 sides assembled and it was enough to hold it. We decided to keep it rather than go through the hassle of returning it. After all the abuse it took to assemble it, I think it will hold up to anything a child could do to it."
1,a pleasant little book . . .,"with, as other reviewers pointed out, a nice selection of practical exercises, like holding a rubber band or some other talisman when you get angry (to remind yourself that almost everyone gets angry and has to get over it), concentrating on one or two words when praying, and trying to think about the positive good you can help create when you are engaged in social action (rather than on who you are angry at for creating the problem)."
1,Watch it and laugh.,"What the heck was ""Th3e House of High Fidelity"" talking about a few reviews back? ""'Animal House' has not survived the advance in comedy that we are now experiencing in film today.""? Huh? What are those advances in comedy? Do you mind telling us?The only advance in comedy that anyone need care about is if it makes you laugh. And this movie will make you laugh. And BTW Mr.""Th3e House of High Fidelity"", the movie takes place in the early 60s not the 50s."
1,You might even see yourself!,"Bitter irony abounds in this poolside read, yet the entertaining antics of the characters are oftentimes true to life. You might even think the author is writing about people you know, or even yourself! The author has concocted a devilish take on human nature that makes you wonder--if a faux dog person prides themselves on getting a dog that acts like a cat, why not simply get a cat in the first place?? You'll have to read it to know what I mean. Highly recommended."
1,"Music kills me, and this record knocks me DEAD","Well, it looks like Ive found the next record to win the coveted David Gould Record of the Year. First, it was The Wiseguys and ""The Antidote""; then it was The Propellerheads with ""Decksanddrumsandrockandroll"". Now its ""Music Kills Me"". I haven't formulated my definitive review yet. It is surely forthcoming. Needless to say, don't wait for my review to buy this record. IT IS AWESOME. A fusion of styles and textures that is immediately accesible on the first listen. A great record, from front to back, that improves with each track. God I love records like that. This is one of those records where all your friends will ask you ""Who is this?"", and you'll feel like your the man because you are on the leading edge... Music Kills Me is multi-layered with great intensity. And I love the fusion of rock and electronica! A must for anyone who takes partying and living life large as serious business. Stay tuned folks."
0,Pretty mediocre read,"Debbie MaComber is usually alot better than this latest book. The dialogue is stiff and at times unbelievable. It reminds me of a novice writer that hasn't quite got their writing technique down. It also reminds me of Sandra Brown's very early works, pretty boring and poorly written. I'm trying to get through this thing, I do not recommend it to anyone. This writer was in a big hurry when she ""wrote"" this one. I bet I could do as good. YUCK!!!"
0,Confessions of an S.O.B.,"Talk about self-absorbed...I guess the ego and the love of self this man displays are essential to success in business...I thought the man made some good points, but few are helpful to anyone in the real world (or outside the newspaper business). Nausea sets in after the second chapter. Neuharth will die an old, lonely, rich man. Respected by many, hated by nearly all. Luckily, I didn't have to sit through this entire book. I put it down quickly."
0,disappointing and disturbing,"I had high expectations from a love story which looked complicated on paper, but honestly I found it disturbing and a bit disappointing. The characters of Sam, Tessa and Allie are written well but the love triangle seems to be stuck in the past for ever and then it is suddenly resolved out of nowhere. It seemed the classic approach of appreciating something more when you are about to lose it. I still fail to understand the marriage and how it worked so long with this major baggage. I guess I just did not like it. The ridiculous way to add a third romantic interest so that everyone is happy is a bit of a letdown too."
0,Hope Floats,"I have always loved this movie. I also like to be able to hear the movie as I view it. The sound quality on this film is terrible. I can barely hear it, and I have good hearing.I lost the box so I couldn't return the film.Just not fair, terribly disappointed."
0,disappointed with the case.,"The overall condition of the case was fine, but the belt clip does not hold very good. For an active person or someone who works alot with their phone on their belt, it falls off all the time. The clip is not strong at all. Myself or my son will not use it any more for that reason."
1,"Sexual climaxs were great, but the ending climax was a dud","This is the first Devine book I've read. I've heard that her stories are comparable to Robin Schoen in eroticism and suspense. The sex was very plentiful and steamy. The characters of Diandra and Justin were well conceived and developed. The plot, altough a bit contrived, was suspenseful and kept my attention, but the ending was hurried. Ms. Devine spent over 270 pages developing the story to have the mystery unraveled in under 10 pages. Also, the fact that Justin and Diandra would find love in the mist of such contention and mistrust is unbelievable. Despite the quick and unsatisfying ending, I recommend the book. Ms. Devine's sexual imagery is outstanding and the story was capitivating. If your looking for a book that will leave you dreaming for some bridal cream this is it."
1,great animation movie - poetic sci-fi,"The original manga from Masamune Shiro was somewhat a great experience. But instead of just trying to render the manga to the screen, Mamoru Oshi (patlabor 1&2, Jinro...) created a real piece of art! Both the design, story, rythm, animation, drawing and music are absolutly astounding! This is not just a sci-fi movie. It avoids all the ""clichés"" and is more poetic than violent. If I had to keep only one movie, this will be the one."
1,Sony ICF-C318,Clock arrived when Amazon said which is typical. Very happy with Amazon shipping. For about $15 this is a great product. Easy to setup. When you turn it on it has the correct time already. Just change the time zone and you're ready. The display is easy to see in daylight or nighttime. There are two alarms and both are extremely easy to set up. Radio works great for its price and alarm is great also. My only complaint was the internal battery had to be replaced after 5 days and no power outages. The replacement battery at WalMart was about $2. Hope the new one lasts longer. I would highly recommend this clock radio.
0,Want to really hose your machine?,"This has got to be the biggest waste of disk ever. I've used different sorts of operating systems, from OS/2, WIN 3.1, WIN95, WIN98 and Windows NT. Thankfully I didn't shell out any cash for this junk - it came prepacked with my HP Pavilion. It locks up the machine at the blink of an eye. Printing with my Canon Multipass has ceased. The help function is a joke - it needs help itself - it fails to initialize and displays a charming number to notify MS suppport with. The real kicker is that the help automatically pops up if there is a cancelled function or error in some other application that you simply backed out of. So, the helpless help comes up and locks the machine. If you want to spend lots of time rebooting the machine - go ahead and buy this. At least this OS boots real fast...I'm replacing it with Windows 2000 Pro."

1,CLASSIC,All of these classic Univeral Pictures are THE ONES to own. Don't miss out on this collection. Only Universal could put these classics together. A must see and a must buy....
1,Good meat slicer,Good for firm meats like ham; not so easy to use for roast beef. Wouldn't recommend for cheese - which would overheat the motor.
0,big let down,"I have this cover in burgandy. It is good to take off and wash, but it hangs ugly and doesn't stay tucked in. It is more work than I hoped for and was a big let down. I suggest a stretchy cover that hugs the furniture for a more sophisticated and tidy look."
1,Not as creepy as people say but a good book,"When plain Jane Goodwin is asked to become one of the Bitches (school royalty) she can't refuse.She will finally be popular.Not the regular kind of popular but so popular that no one can help but worship her.All she has to do is every week steal somthing from another girl and place it on the desk of Lurl the Pearl the creepy early religon teacher.Sounds simple right ""For one to rise another must fall?"". Not.Because a tiny part of Jane's brain is telling her this is wrong.But the bigger part of her brain is making up excuses for her and the other Bitches' behavior.But when Bitsy (the junior Bitch) tries to harm another girl named Camilla Jane stops making excuses and tries to help Camilla who's not as innocent as she seems.This is a good book that will make you look at the popular girls at your school and think ""Are they really that ruthless?"""
1,A Must Read,"Since 9/11, security has become political. This book cuts through the rhetoric and explains how security work and how to be safer. I feel like my eyes have been opened, and I see the security around me in a new light. I'm giving this book to all of my friends for a Christmas present!"

More Often Than Not, I Find The Remote(s) Dead Because Someone Was Not Careful In Placing Into The Charger. $30+ Shipping Will Buy Quite A Few Batteries. Alkaline Cells Far Outlast These As Well. Great Idea, Terrible Design..."
0,Never received!!,I bought this book for my daughter for a college class on the 28th of August and paid the extra money for it to be expedited so she would have it in time for her first assignments. We never received the book and had to withdraw her from her class because she got so far behind in the week we waited. My credit card was charged for both the fee for the book as well as the expedite fee. It's really hard to find any one to talk to. The only contact I have had with anyone from Amazon.com is this request for a review so I am taking the time to vent my disapproval over this transaction.
0,too many errors,"The book has a lot of errors, but is actually good in some areas. The CDROM is unbelievable. It is as if it were a first draft of the book. The practice exams on the CD make no sense at times and are worthless as a study aid."
1,SCRUM BABY,This is a great hands on book for developers and development managers alike. Good analogies and case studies. Great references as well for those of us into process control theory and complexity theory. Only 150 pages makes it very readable.
1,Love It!,"One never wants to give 5 Stars unless it is k.d.lang or an Ella, but I don't want anyone to miss this wonderful treatment of a very interesting collection of song. Highly recommended!"
1,Need to Know about Windows XP? This is the book that will answer all your questions. Damn fine writing too.,"Writer covers all there is concerning XP. I am having fun learning XP and I am wondering why the devil it never came to my depraved mind before, that there had to be someone out there who could unravel the mysteries locked away in XP. Actually, a lot of this stuff I kind of knew but until I got into ""Windows XP for Dummies;9 Books in 1"", I did not know how to unlock? This is the logical book to answer all your questions and unlock the logic of XP. I bought this book from Amazon.com, and as always, I always hit the jackpot with them when I need just about any kind of information."
0,Don't waste the extra money,"We have been going through quality can opener nightmare lately, every single can opener I buy is junk. In fact the one I bought just because I was at wits end, at the Dollar Tree, lasted longer then many high priced can openers, including this one. I saw this and saw $20 for a can opener? But then I thought I am so over it, I am going to splurge for top of the line. I was very excited about ending the nightmare. About 2-3 weeks later, just stopped working, you could fight with it sometimes and manage to finish opening the can you have partially open, but most the time I had to pull the Dollar Tree one out and struggle through that to get my can open. I am very disappointed in oxo. I have always trusted their products without doubt, now I will look on with doubt on them as well. BTW I think this is my first review, if that tells you how strongly I feel about this lol"
0,It was free and it still wasn't worth it,"I picked up this product at a swap meet. It was still in the packaging and hadn't been opened. I'm only rating its use as an ""attention getting"" device--the stopwatch and the alarm clock may work fine, but if you need a stopwatch or an alarm clock you should buy a stopwatch or an alarm clock.As for this, I couldn't get it to record. The pre-recorded sounds (Tarzan yell, rooster, etc) are just garbled gibberish that all basically sound the same. The packaging says ""project your voice 100 feet"" but you have to hold it to your ear just to be able to hear it.This product serves no purpose whatsoever."
0,Memory Foam with Amnesia...,"If you want a memory foam product look elsewhere. This (2.5"", not 3"") pad has a shorter memory than Ronald Regan on Midazolam. Choose a bona fide heavy-weight product, expect to pay well for it, and air it out for a couple of days just to be safe."
0,Just not my movie,Couldn't get into this movie at all. Maybe another day I will try again. I typically love these types of movies I just can't put my finger on what was missing
0,More about religion than murder,"First let me say that for once the Kindle formatting wasn't horrible. A few glitches, but not bad.The story itself seemed to be more about why God would let some things happen than what actually DID happen. As a murder story it didn't entirely hold together, which saddened me because I think she had a good idea and some good characters, but they got over shadowed with the heavy handed God stuff. Not being a religious person it grated really bad for me and I found I skimmed a lot of things. I managed to make it thru this book, but went ahead and deleted the second off my Kindle. I don't think I can handle any more sermon."
0,Total waste of time and paper,"Contains examples that fail to work. Also the explanations are SO BAD they don't help at all. The API docs contain more information than this ever will. I'd love to like it, but so there. Go for more general books instead."
0,Disappointed!,"This was a hard book for me to get interested in to begin with. But I kept reading and it really did get better and then I thought I was missing some of the book. I even went back a couple of pages on my Kindle thinking I hit the forward button by mistake. Here in what I would have thought was the middle of the book are all these character discriptions and some of the characters were not even in the book. Any series I have ever read had a beginning, middle and an end. The books could have stood alone, but made me want to continue reading the series to see how the story and the characters evolve. I felt with this book I really was missing part of the book. I doubt I'll finish this series unless the rest of the books are offered for free or the 99 cent special. The only way I'd pay more is if the second one is free and I feel the books are actually going somewhere."
1,This really works,Arthramine Chewable - Small and Medium Breed - 120 tabsI have 2 mini doxies and they were beginning to show signs of painful joints. I bought this product and was amazed. After one week they are both running and much more active than they have been.I can recommend this product without any reservations. I will be keeping my dogs on this product.
1,A billion year future history,"Poul Anderson, one of our great science fiction writers, takes us on a journey of a billion years with this yarn. It begins with astronaut Christian Brannock in the near term future and ends about a billion years later, with humanity scattered across the galaxy and for the most part uploaded into the computers that span the galaxy and control everything. A few humans have been re-instated on earth for an experiment run by a perhaps slightly deranged computer called Gaia.This novel did keep my interest, although it may be too far 'off the wall' for some tastes."
1,He who is without sin!,"“Casting the First Stone” by Kimberla Lawson Roby is a masterful presentation of creative writing. Ms. Roby is very inventive and uses great imagination in portraying the characters and situations of her story. In this novel, she vividly described the fraught lives of a married couple who struggles to remain faithful to each other in their Christian walk. Tanya, who is presupposed to have achieved a degree of life success, is married to Curtis, a charismatic pastoral husband who is laden with some obvious spiritual weaknesses. As their marriage suffered, Tanya’s serene and beautiful love of life began to turn sour and her affection for the things she once admired began to grow cold. And like a woman who was abducted for marriage falls in love with her abductor, she learns of her husband’s infidelity and succumbs to the same weaknesses that plagued his life. It is an interesting read."
0,cannot use these speakers outside powered by electricity,"I returned the speakers. The instructions said that they cannot be used outside with the charger, i.e when you used them outside the power has to come from the batteries. I wanted to use in my porch and did not want to have to change the batteries constantly."
0,AV Cable didn't work,I bought this mainly for the audio video cable and it didn't work. I got sound from the unit but no video. The other cables might work I have not used them yet because I generaly charge my ipod through a FM transmitter. I did like the screen protector that came with the kit.
0,Too disorganized for beginners; too basic for everyone else,"I really doubt anyone could learn Transact-SQL in 21 days using this book. On the contrary, you could spend 21 months with this one and still not get there. It's disorganized and free-styled to a fault. The topics are all over the place. Also the writing is inconsistent. One minute, it's at 30,000 feet, the next minute, it's on the runway. One minute, the author is talking down to you, the next minute, he's attempting to be your buddy. If you're looking for a quick, systematic introduction to Transact-SQL, keep looking."
1,One of my best and most used books,"I play many styles of music, but Jazz is my favorite, as the chords are the warmest of them all.You don't need to pound on the guitar, do a bunch of bends, play the same two notes to monotony, or have any accompaniment to sound full bodied and just right all by yourself. Blues does this to a point, but just does not use the full bodied chords that Jazz does.Jazz chords are not necessarily easy, but well worth it once you have them down.The book goes through the types of chord forms until around page 31 and then you are off with the actual progressions.I am an old Wes Montgomery fan and can remember many good times with his music and now I can actually play someof it."
0,RIDICULOUS !,"This death-metal band from Liverpool is worst than Cannibal Corpse (if that is possible! ) THe lyrics are ridiculous, the songs poor. Blergh!"
1,"Dreamy, more original, less corny","Front Line Assembly's side-project Delerium is sounding more dreamy and original than ""Symantic Spaces"". Less corny, a little less of the embarrassing Enigma beats and choirs, much more Mid-Eastern chanting and soundscapes, and stunning female vocals. Favourites: ""Silence"", ""Window To Your Soul"", ""'Til The End Of Time"". Try and get the double CD version which includes some interesting remixes from this album and ""Symantic Spaces"".To FLA fans who don't know Delerium, these two bands have nothing in common - this, the later Delerium work is pseudo-commercial ethereal (earlier work can be described as ambient), compared to FLA's industrial signature."
1,Lots of Interesting Twists and Turns,"I was not immediately taken with the book, however, as the characters developed I caught on to MB's style. She is constantly weaving in and out of situations and characters. Finally, you see all of it forming a amazing tapestry. The plotting is well crafted and the character's grow and develop through out the book. I miss them now that I am done. I definately recommend this book."
1,Great watch but fades quickly,"I loved this watch when I got it. It was very low price but has worked for over a year for all my workout needs. It is fairly simple to use, Ive only had a few issues figuring out the functions. My only large complaint is that the gorgeous bright blue color of the watch quickly faded to a grey color (within about 1 month of purchase) so now I feel like I need a new one! Maybe black next time to prevent color loss."
0,Meek and Mild,"A well-meaning friend gave me this CD as a present. He saw this performer playing ""live"" on a street in Palm Springs. He knew I enjoyed piano, so he brought me this.Despite the hype on the cover of being inspired by ""Christ"" and ""angels"", the performance strangely dispassionate and almost meek in character, as if Delarue is afraid of what he's doing.I noticed another review that gave this 5 stars. It should be noted that the ""glowing review"" seems to be from this performers music publisher."
1,ENLIGHTENING!,Thanks to Mr. Grisanti for his review of the pitfalls that one can fall prey to in this multi million dollar industry.I am a lot smarter from reading this book and I suspect that I will be more physically fit without having to advance my loan for additional funding!
1,"Very Good, but not Perfect","I bought this rice cooker a month ago and we used it almost every day. We used it to cook white rice most of the time. I have tried brown rice once and sponge cake twice.White Rice: Taste and texture-wise, it's the same as my other rice cookers. But it takes 45min to cook (vs 20min in others). There is a Quick Cook feature, but that is 30min still. There is 1 noticeable difference with the rice, it tastes very good the next day with microwave reheating.Brown Rice: Texture-wise, there is a huge difference from my other rice cookers. The brown rice is soft and plum, but it takes almost 2hr to cook.Sponge Cake: The cakes collapsed both times after I opened the lid.Features I like:- Retractable power cord- Non-stick coating bowl- Music indicator of when it starts and ends- ""Bumpy"" spatula and spatula holder on the sideFeatures I don't like:- No condensation collector- Having to clean inner lid every time"
1,A cream-puff of a miniseries,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""The Starter Wife,"" even though it isn't the type of show I usually watch. It was a delight -- lots of chuckles, with enough serious subject matter to keep it from being a dramatized version of the Shopping Channel. Deborah Messing is perfect as the ""starter wife"" who's dumped by her studio honcho husband and thinks her life is over. Not so -- a new life is just beginning. Messing and her small coterie of loyal friends are great, and the hunk she finds on the beach is a feast for the eyes. The miniseries is great fun, guaranteed to bring a smile."
1,memoirs of a geisha,"If you read the book or saw the movie, this will just add to the beauty and magic of it all.... It will make all that you read and saw live vividly in your heart and fantasies...."
0,Historical value only,"Stowkowski is one of the most renowned conductors, and Symphony No.9 ""From The New World"" is one of the best known classical works.This recording was made in 1927, and the CD was mastered from 78 rpm discs; there are many sonic abberations, despite any restoration that was done.So if you are looking for a stunning performance and recording of this marvelous work by Dvorak, don't buy this.If you are looking for a historical recording that might give you a look into why Stowkowski was so good, to hear the nuances and shadings he gave the piece, and experience this piece as only he could interpret it, then this is a good CD to buy.But don't expect a great, clean recording without mechanical and electronic artifacts."
1,The Velveteen Rabbit,I was very happy with the book. Although it was small it was a wonderful addition. I ordered for friends as well.
1,For Real,"I really enjoyed this movie and I have watched it several times. All of the actors were great and I mean all of them. I think it is a movie that should be played in schools, and especially the troubled youth centers because it is a true story."
0,too soon for review,I ordered the Canon fax and am using the cartridge which came with it so I can't yet review this product. Iwas very pleased with you system. The transaction was very easy.
1,Loved it,I wished i'd have known about this show before it went off-air. My dad had the series and the Serenity movie I watched both and wish there was more. I wasn't sure i'd like the show but i'd heard about the movie so i decided to give the show a try. I really enjoyed it. I think those zombie things are freaky but they never really show much gore. I like all the characters each is very different. I thought the westerness of it was a nice suprise. I liked the people more in the show than in the movie because i got to know them more.I wish they could continue the show right where they left off. Stop reading reviews and get this show even if your only a little interested because you won't regret it.
1,Great Display,"I recommend the Planet Bike Protege 9.0 bike computer. It is easy to use and has a large display. At this price, getting temp display is rare so it's an added bonus."
1,a true essay 'about the blues',"If one were to write a complete overview spaning Julie London's entire career, 'About the Blues' would stand in the Top 5 of her best albums.Not only does it have a film-noir-type feel to it, but is so haunting, and makes you feel as if you were walking alone at night, it's kinda cold out, and you're looking behind your back to see if any other life form is of existancee."
1,Excellent resource,"As the previous readers have noted, this is an excellent resource. It's so good that it seems petty to complain about the errors and typos that are found throughout the text, but they do detract from the professionalism of the book - especially since Ms. Goldman is an educator. I hope this review will at least wake up Ms. Goldman's editors to fix all the errors for the next edition. Her website has similar problems."
0,Movie deceptive in areas,Interesting attempt at Hawaiian history. One point: The Bayonet constitution disenfranchised Hawaiians only if they couldn't read or own land valued over $3000.
0,stream of water too small,"I hope it's better quality than brita, but as far as i can tell this is a sad little stream of water and it takes up too much space in my sink. It makes it difficult for me to fill my water bottle and other containers. Overall, i think i'd take brita over this jus cause it fills a lot faster."
1,Another gem by NOVA,"Although there has been some films mentioning about UAV's (unmanned aerial vehicles), this one has the best coverage so far. The motivation dates back to U-2 flying over the Soviet sky. From the Cold War, Mid East conflicts, Vietnam War, Gulf War and Afghanistan, the experience leads to the evolution of UAV's and makes them more and more powerful and robust.Unlike the large-scale UAV's such as the Predator and Global Hawk, small-scale or even micro-scale UAV's also found their importance and are being developed. This is also an interesting part in this film.The content of this DVD is pretty thorough and comprehensive. After having watched it, I just feel it completely delightful and entertaining. Although I've already had certain understanding about UAV's, it is still an eye-opener for me.I have seen couple tech-related films by NOVA and found them well made. This one is no exception. For people who like military aircraft, this is the one you never should miss."
1,Cali- Suite a Gotta See!,"Product was received in a very timely manner, professionally packaged, and new...as advertised! This movie is intertwines between stories of four couples on a vacation. One story is somewhat serious and complex, but has a wry/somewhat comical story line mixed in the the dramatic role of Alan Alda and Jane Fonda. The other 3 stories are simply hilarious. I mean, when you mix Bill Cosby, Richard Prior, Walter Matthau, Michael Caine.....with this kind of an cast, you can't loose! It is good fun with a 70s kind of comic fun! It is hilarious and a must-see! I highly recommend Amazon as I received this DVD in new condition and wonderfully packaged!"
0,Sorry! Not for me.,This is my second purchase of In-ear-headphones. I have a hearing problem and find buds more comfortable than the standard head phone but the soundwith these to me is close to nothing. The first ones are OK. I checked these against all the headphones I have and I suppose that is just the way theyare. Price was OK and that is about all.Reviews on Amazon were a little mixed on these.
0,Disappointing,"I'm surprised by the number of ""5 stars"" and that is what motivated me to write this review.My 5 year old enjoys using my laptop and is a whiz at his Leapster, and this led his grandfather to think this would be a great gift. When we opened the gift it looked so neat, I could see the attraction, but I agree with all of those who have talked about the small black-and-white display with very poor resolution. The games are not nearly as good as those on the Leapster and the laptop is pretty large to take places. After a few minutes playing on his laptop, he always asks to play on my laptop. If anything, it has increased his desire to use my computer, and this is not good.We have a VTECH digital camera that is great - I'm surprised by how poor the graphics are on the Nitro Laptop. Even at that low price, the technology is at a point where they should be able to offer something better."
1,updated information--,"Makes this an interesting read. However, I would recommend reading Rosas THEY CALLED HIM WILD BILL before undertaking this biography. Much of the prior information in Hickoks life is not dealt with in great detail here. But the new information is well worth it. Rosa is a meticulous researcher who writes with great passion on this subject."
0,...not the best.,"The first two performances were nice, mainly b/c one included an early Zoe Jakes which was interesting to see how much she has improved up to this point. Overall though, I found most of the performances to be quite rough around the edges, some didn't seem well rehearsed, there was a lot of ""tugging"" on costumes during the middle of a dance, the ""asian"" piece seemed almost to be mocking instead of interesting, and basically the entire thing just lacked a certain ""finish"". I'm glad I rented it from my local belly dance shop (Black Sea Trading Company) before purchasing b/c I would have been very dissappointed."
0,Call him Cold Nix instead of Hot Nix,"I just listened to the whole cd from beginning to end, and I'm dissapointed, but not alot because I wasn't expecting alot from Method Man on this CD. One of my main complaints is why in the **** do the good songs such as #7 and #15 barely last 3 minutes, while his ""garbage"" songs, such as #11, last for 4 1/2 minutes!!!!!! The M-E-T-H-O-D Man has definitely went commercial....in other words he pulled what I call an ""Ice Cube"".Yall remember the ""old"" Ice Cube before all the movies and how nobody on the west couldn't touch him. Thats how Meth was, but sadly we may never see the ""old"" Meth again. On a good note #7 is str8 FIRE!!!!!! but too d*mn short. Buy this CD from a used CD joint....there are probably some at a used CD store already."
1,Jolly good!,"I love the Redwall series, and I mean that I love every book in it. This one, however, is my favorite. I think that the hares are my favorite group of characaters in Jacques' books and since this book centered around the elite fighting unit known as The Long Patrol, it makes sense that this is my favorite. You can't help but fall in love with Tammo and Russa as they make their way to Redwall and it's famed fare. And Damug Warfang is one of those villains that you just love to hate. Redwall fan or not, this book is totally great!"
1,great,"I planted my raspberries in the shade, because the Dallas Sun can be brutal on plants, so far it is doing well. I also liked the way the company packages plants for delivery."
1,Remember the Old Days,"Brought back memories of your days. Lots of songs. Did a good job of engineering, but minus 1 star due to quality of old recordings."
0,"Lots of Basset photos, short on Basset specifics.","I got the 1995 edition of this when I got my Basset. I enjoyed the MANY photos of Bassets, but was disappointed that most of the book appears to be a generic insert that fits in ANY general dog book complete with lots of advertisements for miscellaneous dog stuff. It looks like there is a fill in the blank form used to create the books where you type in a few breed-specific details and lots of photos and -- presto! -- a new book.Less than 30 pages (of 224) are specific to Bassets."
1,Better Than Good,"Great album,....it is good to hear Paul Gilbert dosomething else besides shredding.Felt a little awkwardbuying this album at the beginning but boy was I surprised.Uncle Jimmi has one helluva vibrato.Rock On!!"
0,spend your money elsewhere...,"My mom bought me this rice cooker because she was sick of me cooking rice with a pot. She should have just saved her money. The rice burns on the bottom, the lid cracked and became unusable after a few months and the rice never tasted that great either. Look to zojirushi or elsewhere."
1,love the look,"this is a great buy.........took less than a hour to put together....pretty heavy, but it comes with materials so you can attach the armoire to the wall for a child like mine who likes to try & climb things.......would of gave it a 5 star, but one of the parts was broken when we recieved it (it came quicker than expected)....called the customer service & gave the serial # & with no questions asked they shipped the part right away (i didn't have to send the old/broken part back).......lots of room for whatever you would desire plus the drawers are great........looks good w/ the combo tower & rochester crib, we went with the oak & don't regard our decision......gets compliments whenever we have guest"
0,Since when could magic missiles miss?,"I enjoyed Baldur's Gate I and II for the PC, for hack and slash ""rpgs"" they were immersive, and while not as fun as sitting around the table with my friends and my dice, they were a good waste of time. Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance is different. I picked it up because it was cheap, and I'm kind of a nerd and collect Forgotten Realms stuff, and it did say it followed 3rd edition rules. Right. What I got was one of the worst games money could buy that basically, in my opinion, made fun of d&d. And the magic missiles... I missed a lot with them in this game...in d&d they can't miss. Period. This game was awful... I miss games that had a plot"

1,James Bond meets Dr House.,"I thoroughly enjoyed the book. Every bit as funny as Laurie's comedy. His writing voice is unique and amusing. I smiled through the entire book, even in the tense moments."
1,Love my mirrors.,"I love my Mirrycle mirrors. They were easy to install, nice looking, and they have been extremely easy to use. They are nice looking mirrors but I do wish they were a little bigger."
1,mea culpa brock,"Blinded by the Right was a book that was hard to put down for a moderate/liberal devotee of fair play and and at least some degree of honesty in government and the fourth estate. It is ludicrous to attack Brock, as some have, for being unbelievable now since he has admitted to lying in the past. Blinded by the Right reads like the truth, a truth Brock has no credible reason for coloring. Independent thinkers who are not affiliated with movements or political parties should find the facts in the book highly illuminating and if they are serious about casting responsible votes, they will take a long hard look at the ""brain trust"" in the current administration and the forces and events that allowed that ""trust"" and its agenda to be placed in control of the free world."
0,"Nice watch, horrible crystal","Had this for less than 6 months, wore quite sparingly. After not wearing for 3-4 days opened my watch drawer and the crystal essentially peeled off around perimeter. The crystal must be total junk. Now for a kicker, the crystal is not covered by ""lifetime warranty"" They want $30 + $9 return shipping to put another crystal in, which will not be warrantied either...Given the fact that other people are experiencing this, avoid, at least until quality of crystal improves."
1,Real Useful Information for Real Non-Profit Professionals,"Prince and File really did a number on this book. It contains valuable information about how to friend raise, how best to serve friends of your non-profit, and how to keep them on board with your organization. The book describes seven philanthropic ""personalities"" and allows the reader to think about his or her own constituents and how they might fit in with these personalities. A remarkable work, that is insightful yet easy to understand and apply."
0,Yawn.,"Found this to be a very disappointing ""chick flick"". Your wife or date mightlove it, but you'll fall asleep."
1,Your mileage may vary,"Quite a range of reviews for this book; it seems to have different appeal to different types of people. I enjoyed the writing style and her approach very much and will probably re-read it. My only problem with the book is that the testimonial letters are written in a script font that is a little difficult to read on the Kindle.There are many books full of organizing tips, and some great Kindle blogs as well. Get this if you want another way of thinking about the causes of messiness."
0,"Nothing new, just another anti-semitic book.","When author is afraid to name who is really responsible (and we are not stupid, we know who hijacked those airplanes) he's blaming a victim. Nothing new, just another anti-semitic book.Besides this book looks REALLY stupid after three intelligence officers said this year that the U.S. military intelligence had identified lead 9/11 hijacker Mohamed Atta as a member of al-Qaida who might be part of U.S.-based terror cell long before the terror attack: ""a classified military intelligence unit called ""Able Danger"" identified Atta and three other hijackers in 1999 as potential members of a terrorist cell in Brooklyn, New York. Defense Department lawyers rejected the unit's recommendation that the information be turned over to the FBI in 2000."". This is liberal lawyers as usual always protecting terrorist's rights.But, anti-Semites already bought this book :-)..."
0,2nd worst textbook I have ever encountered!,"This introductory text is strictly written for those who already possess a strong background in the field. The writing is poor (even for an engineering text), concepts are not fully expanded upon, formulas and general ""look-up"" concepts are nearly nonexistant, examples (which are few) cover only very general cases, and corresponding problems are disproportionally difficult. In many cases, examples are not worked, but instead contain the phrase, ""It is left as an exercise for the reader to complete this example."" As an analogy, imagine an example describing addition with the phrase, ""It is left as an exercise for the reader to derive integration."" A text must have the potential to be used as reference material, but because of the lack of concrete information and worked examples, this book has been robbed of that potential."
1,Stylish drying rack that looks great on the counter,The thought of bottles and a drying rack on my limited counter top space made me cringe. I absolutely love the Skip Hop Splash drying rack and don't mind leaving it out on the counter. It is easy to clean and has lots of spaces for drying. One thing to note: the color is not a bright white color. It's more of an off white.
1,rving in westvirgina,My son got me a stereo for my rv for when I went to georga for my daughters wedding. It was the first tip I ever took This far in my rv since I got it last year.Let me tell ya This is a really sharp looking system and the sound is awsum! The trip was a realBlast If you know what I mean. great work jenson The wedding went great Except I had to give my little girl away!Proud and Happy Father.
0,Unrealistic and self-serving.,The title really does say it all. This person is feeling entitled that the world is serving to them because they popped out a kid. No. I won't be kind to you because you decided to get a tax deduction out of your nether regions.
0,Plummet,"Xzibit's Restless gets worse and worse with each listen. The first time I was a little generous on this album and it received three stars. But now going back trying to listen to it...it just aint hittin on nothing. This album is complete garbage. I had so many high expectations for this album...but am extremely disappointed. There's only about three good songs. Xzibit's aggressiveness and lyrical prowess is nowhere to be found, the beats are too commercialized and poppy sounding...it just makes me want to throw up. To me this is the equivalent of Faboulous' album, in terms of wackness...and I wouldn't recommend it all....not even to burn it from a friend. His other albums are exponentially greater than this trash...Lets just hope his next album `Man Vs. Machine' is nothing like this. Don't buy this...and avoid it all costs."
0,not working,"have used Stink Free on rugs and wood floors, product smells awful on its own and doesn't really deter my 4 Chihuahuas"
1,I can dig it!!!!!!!,"I like ""Shaft"". I guess it's because I am one of the biggest Sam Jackson fans in the world. I loved this movie because not only was it portrayed by a phenomenal actor,it had a good plot, and a excellent soundtrack."
1,Really Good!!!!,"You should buy this album, All the songs are reallyyy good!!!:) And we discover lots fabulous artists, and James Lackey (Usher's brother) produced a lot of songs in this album and he is really good!!!!"
1,Beautiful and Unique,"Not like anything I've ever heard from Rickie Lee Jones. I've read some of the other reviews, so felt compelled to write one. Not everyone song works, but all are powerful and moving. If you are looking for glossy, packaged, commercial pop, this isn't right for you. If you are looking for incantatory, raw, eclectic music with a spiritual twist and stream of consciousness lyrics, then this is for you. This album is a revelation."
0,Adhesive problems,"I emailed Pampers MONTHS ago and never even received a response. We have been devoted Pampers customers from the beginning (my son is 2 1/2) and I was horrified to see that there was some ""adhesive"" on the baby side of the diaper. It irritated his skin and in that same huge box, several (a dozen or more) diapers had the same problem.I am so disappointed, particularly with no response from their customer service."
0,Not helpful at all,"By the title, one would expect this volume to be a sort history of haiku as it relates to Japanese culture. As I found when i purchased this, it is certainly not. Ninety percent of this book is comprised of essays by the author concerning his faith and devotion to Christian doctrine without mention of haiku at all. The last 10 pages or so are filled with his haiku in English, which are not outstanding. I am baffled by the title, since haiku seemingly has very little to do with Mr Norimoto's life."
1,Reminds me of CastleVania,Brings back memories of walking through the cursed passages of Count Dracula's castle with the legendary whip of the Belmont clan.
1,Rock Canadian style - eh?,"All four discs on this box set are awesome. Although most of the tunes are over 10 - 15 years old they definetly will stand the test of time.From ""Shot Down in Flames"" (a tribute to Bon Scott) to the progressive mid-80's riffs of Baby Blue to a complimentary job of Free's ""All Right Now"" this box set really shows that Canada can rock!I can't wait and hope that the rumours are true and that the band is thinking of reuniting.DougY"
1,"Really about ""US""","This movie is done similarly to documentary but, quite different. It seems the normal but, it twist. It shows people that are willing to work and see the big picture. It a true story and not the movie you expect. I really like this movie its for the family and couples to share. It gives the chance for relating as people. Its a winner. It has cameo's by two legends african american community Rube Dee and Morgan Freeman. Their roles are small but their impact is Deep! :! If you get the chance, the movie lives up to its title in that its ""All About US""."
0,Good for one and a half years only,I ordered this item and have checked it monthly only to notice that it has lost a significant amount of the original charge and needs to be replaced... after 18 months. The manufacturer stated that is should be discarded in twelve years if it has not been used. Apparently I got a dud. I am unable to return it because Amazon does not accept hazardous materials returns.
1,Family. For better or for worse.,"Although the novel bounces around from narrator to narrator, the main thread, and most entertaining character by far, is George. And what starts with the discovery of a skin lesion, leads us through a whirlwind of life changing choices, personal tragedies, paranoia and, in the end, a family, with all their scars and shortcomings, somehow getting through it all. A smart, funny and wry look at life. Mark Haddon is one of those wonderful writers who creates characters who you hate to say goodbye to when the book ends."
1,"Highly readable, very informative","This is probably my favorite book on U.S. social history. While academic, it's written in a very readable style. The authors make the history of American families extremely interesting, and they shatter some of our more romantic cultural myths. I referred to this book when I wrote my master's thesis on the U.S. household economy of the 1930s during the Great Depression. My first ancestors in this country lived in New England in the early to mid 1600s, so I find these accounts fascinating, as I can imagine how all of my ancestors since that time lived their lives in our developing country and culture. I highly recommend this book to students, history researchers, or the curious casual reader."
1,thunderdome,classic movie when mel gibson was normal master blaster gotta love him best of the mad max movies too bad there wasn't a sequel to thunderdome
0,So I guess I bought it just to look at ??,This charger sucks. I couldn't say how it works considering I can't even get it connected to my player. I have tried hooking it up every conceivable way and it just won't do it. So my opinion is thats it is a new art piece for my car that will float around forever.
1,Sirius Tuner,"I like the display and it is very light. The only problem is that is runs very hot and if installed in a cabinet, can be an issue. Otherwise, I am very happy with it's performance."
0,Don't believe the hype.,I wish I enjoyed this movie. Lots of great shiny images but sadly it moved so slowly that I fell asleep at the theatre.
0,Madonna's voice is simply too weak...,...for musical singing. It gets on your nevers after some time and you simply have heard better versions of these songs by better singers often before
1,Great coffee machine!,"I saw this unit on vacation and came home and bought one. That was several years ago. Finally, our beloved brewstation gave up the ghost and went on to coffeeland in the sky. So, I promptly bought another one. Morning is just not the same without our brewstation!"
0,Popeye takes a beating,"A warning to Popeye fans: The ""75th Anniversary"" reference is deceptive, leading one to believe that this 3-disc set contains some of the delightfully bizarre Max Fleischer efforts of the 1930s or the tamer but still entertaining Famous Studios entries of the 1940s. But no, this ""Collector's Edition"" is comprised of 86 of the lame King Features Syndicate knockoffs from 1960-61. These hastily-produced, barely-animated, made-for-TV cheapies do an injustice to the Popeye legend. Under ideal circumstances, the spinach-gulping sailor man was showcased in some of the best cartoons ever made. Here, unfortunately, his reputation takes the kind of severe beating Jim Caviezel suffered in THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST. Lord have mercy!"
1,Amazing!,"I was amazed at how complete, thorough, and well thought out this book is. There ARE stages of life, and you have to think of money and wealth-building differently at each stage. Anyone in middle age--or approaching it--can benefit from reading this book."
1,creed rocks,"To all that thinks this is a pearl jam ripoff--I have got a statement for you. Creed rocks harder than pearl jam. Listen to what if, and are you ready, these boys can jam. Some albums you buy nowdays have one or two good songs, the rest filler. This album is 90% great. So get off your high horse and admit it Creed rocks!"
0,Only out of love for Ted do I give this two stars,"Ted Raimi is this movie's only saving grace, and the only reason I bought it. Here's a question for you: If Traci Lord's vengeful character Heidi is so ashamed of the way she looks, then why does she spend the whole movie dressed in nothing but lingerie and a trench coat? And did you notice that Dennis carves up that chicken with a dirty knife? Yuck! This movie was obviously the brain child of a male mind. Don't bother unless you are a big Ted Raimi fan."
1,a little scratched up,"The knife came a little scratched up . it looked used.--still, the quality is good and it is going to get scratched up any way"
1,wonderful,"Perry Como is one of my favorites, this CD has some of his best songs, ""Magic Moments ""and"" Catch a falling star"", song I haven't heard for years, brings back great memories. Well worth it."
0,Use something else for OCP exam preparation,"The book contains many typos, mistakes, misuse of therminology.A person new to Oracle would need to do a lot of extra work to decipher it.Look for other books to prepare yourself for OCP exam.BTW, the other book by J.Couchman, ""OCP Introduction to Oracle9i: SQL Exam Guide"" is no better."
1,FUN!,"If you like RETRO, come along back to the time when we were young, happy, and the Folks did all the work and worrying!Linda Muir"
0,"Silly, but entertaining.","Have you ever been cursed? You know, the usual: You're walking down the street minding your own business when, suddenly, you smell brimstone. The cement below your feet starts to heat up, and then the vague outline of a lesser demon appears. I hate it when that happens. So you whip out your trusty St. Vitus' charm, a ragged copy of the Good News, and a long, pointed stick and prepare to do battle with the forces of evil.Above all else, this book will make you feel a lot better about yourself, knowing that there are so many much sillier people out there who might actually believe this hokum. But it is also scary, in that they might be your neighbors."
1,Grandson loves this.,"My 5 year old grandson loves everything Thomas. I love them because they are great teaching tools for teaching valuable life lessons. Friendship, honesty, faithfulness, dependability, caring, sharing, and punctuality are taught in these stories and isn't that what we all need to get along better in life. These later edition Thomas DVD's are fully animated and that just makes them all the more appealling to children. Hope they keep up the wonderful work."
1,Comfortable and Lightweight,Comfortable and lightweight. Not crazy about how the buttons are attached. Had to resew one on after wearing just a few times. Cool in hot weather. Need to be lightly ironed after coming out of dryer. Reasonably priced for the quality.
1,Multi region does not mean any DVD,"I purchased this DVD player based on the other reviews that said that the owners were able to pop in their European DVD's and that the DVD player worked just fine. However, mine did not work. I put a call in to Philips and they said that the DVD itself has to be a multi region DVD in order for the DVD player to play it. I then found a discussion on Amazon with the access code to get into the setup menu and change the DVD player to any region. Works just fine now."
0,Terrible,"This is the worst thing I've ever bought. It literally takes me 30-40 minutes to warm the bottle to just below room temperature (still pretty cool), meanwhile my daughter is screaming out of hunger in the background. I should get paid for using something so crappy."
1,Good textbook for Constitutional Law,I used this book in my Constitutional Law and it provided great coverage of landmark Court cases without being too boring! It was an assigned text but I kept it after I finished the class (and even now that I've graduated) because it is very useful when I have constitutional questions.
0,Meh.,"This was an album purchase that would have been better as a ""buy a couple tracks"" purchase. I really liked ""James K. Polk"" and ""Exquisite Dead Guy,"" but that was it. The songs that try to be more rock, like ""S-E-X-X-Y"" and ""XTC vs Adam Ant,"" are just too slow. The former even pauses pretty often, which is a fine thing to do if there's, you know, MUSIC the rest of the time. It's just a lot of foreplay without getting to the deed, you know? You're basically waiting for the song to start the whole time and it just never does.The rest of the tracks are just a loose, lazy, bubblegum pop that I really don't care for."
0,will only buy this in store from now on,"despite a current ""sell by"" date this product arrived stale and dry. i will only purchase it in the store from now on where i can inspect it better."
0,Don't waste your money,"I got the TeleZapper when the ""Out of Area"" calls on our Caller ID hit 13 in one day. I bought it and kept it on our phone line, following their directions for 4 weeks. We're now up to 20 in a day and the TeleZapper has been returned. I bought mine at Best Buy and should have gotten a hint from the fact that all of the TeleZapper boxes appeared to be taped (e.g. returned and repackaged). At the exact time I returned mine, someone else was also returning one. My advice to you is, don't bother."
1,Better than Earth Crisis,"""As the Last Light Drains"" is an exceptional melodic hardcore metal release by former Earth Crisis members. While there are definate similarities in the sounds of the 2 bands, I personally think that Freya sounds better -- not necessarily heavier, just with better songwriting overall. Will appeal to fans of bands such as Sworn Enemy, Hatebreed, Ringworm, and of course Earth Crisis.Standout songs include ""Glasseating Smile"" and ""April Witch""."
0,Pure Dreck but the Fashions are a Hoot,"I can't believe some here loved this laughably inept, sub-Scorsese dreck. Badly written, directed, and acted, its only value is to remind you how good the classics of the mob genre are in comparison. The final shootout, which someone here raves over, is especially hilarious. The gunmen who whack the wedge cut-wearing guido ""hero"" really are the gang that couldn't shoot straight. It's fun to check out the 70s hairdos (Frank Vincent's poodle cut is a hoot) but that's about the only redeeming feature about this C-grade flick."
0,They Saved Hitler's DVD,"This is one for bad movie fans. UCLA film student picked up the rights to an unreleased turkey called “Madmen of Mandoras,” added some incompetent, unrelated new footage at the beginning, and released it under the new, more lurid title “They Saved Hitler’s Brain.” The result is the absolute bottom of the barrel of cinema – and a delight for bad movie fans like myself. Night turns to day turns to night during a car chase, the plot suddenly changes around the 20 minute mark, and der fuhrer’s head melts in a fiery car crash.The DVD, released by Rhino, claims to be “remastered from original film elements.” It still looks pretty miserable and sounds absolutely atrocious, but I suppose that should be expected. It’s presented in the 1.33:1 aspect ratio, despite being shot at 2.20:1. There are no special features unless you count a list of similarly themes Rhino titles. The menu is absolutely hilarious."
1,It's good!,"This album is not as good as ""A Place in The Sun"" or ""Everywhere"", but it is good. Although it is not the true country music that we all are used to hearing from Mr. McGraw. I didn't like it the first time I heard it but it has grown on me. Good jod Tim. The only problem with this record is this: I saw Tim and Faith together at Baltimore Arean in Dec. of 2000 and he played ""Let Me Love You"" at the end of the show, but instead of him being solo, like it is on the record, it was a duet and it sounded better that way. None the less it's still a good song and a good record."
0,"If i could take one star away, I would.","This was the ABSOLUTE worst thing I've everbought online! I mean really horrible, the imagery was short, very nondescriptive. The speaker doesn't walk you into reaxation, so its hard to focus. I got better reults for free, from a script my yoga instructor wrote, that my husband read allowed."
0,worried,"I was very concerned when I rec'd this product. it was made in China, and a number of the ""sticks"" were broken with grayish brown sediment around them. They had a terrible smell. My dog took one sniff and walked away (she usually eats any ""treat"" I give her). I think this product should be taken off of the Amazon sales site. I usually like to shop for products at Amazon. Now I am leery to do so."
1,Math Whiz,Awesome little toy. Child can start off at the easy level and work their way up. Game is esy to use and easy to understand. Has all levels of math for any child and I appreciate the fact that my child can have fun and learn at the same time.
1,great toy,"my son loves this toy, even after having it a year. he is 2 now and has just as much fun. and i have more fun because now i dont have to chase after the balls as he can do it himself now. the music can be a little annoying but then it is not a toy for me, it is for the little ones and they love it."
1,She's back and I'm glad,"I used to be a big Nora Roberts fan and then her books started to really annoy me for some reason. Perhaps they seemed a little bit rehashed, the men are always beautifully written but the women seemed petulant and annoying. Well with ""Dance Upon the Air"", the Nora Roberts I so enjoyed reading is back and I'm delighted! Nell, Mia and Ripley are lovely! Nell is a wounded spirit without being a pathetic little lame bird. She's scarred but strong, Zack is gorgeous of course and the whole feel of the island is wonderful. I really enjoyed this book and believe that Nora Roberts captured the 'sanctuary' feeling of the island perfectly. I can't wait until the other books come out."
0,PLEASE READ BEFORE BUYING!!!!,"Is not compatible and it does not fit(even though Amazon's fitment tool says it does) on my 2003 325CI(E46 chassis, face-lifted, round fog lights) with standard business CD player, no H&K; sound and no navigation system.Please do not buy this if you own this car because is not even close to the factory connector, maybe this harness is not even made for E46 models I really don't know or maybe it will fit other E46 models but not mine, a total let down, would give it 0 stars. Can't send it back because I live in Guatemala and shipping costs alone would surpass the price of this worthless product.Gonna try this one instead:Scosche BW01B1990-Up BMW Import Speaker Connector, hope it fits."
1,No such thing as 'On the fence',"Look - either you're with Megadeth or you're not. You can't be both. Megadeth is 100% awesome in all they do musically. Dave Mustaine is the most talented guitarist of all time. They were great with the first album, and they're great now. End of story."
1,I like it,Nice sturdy rack. Especially like the hooks that hold the bikes in place. Work much better than straps and don't look like they will wear out. My wife also found it pretty easy to get bikes in place and locked down. I recommend it.
0,Riddled with Errors,"I am currently using this book for an upper-level university course, and I don't believe it could be much worse. I am no geneticist, but I find errors on every other page and even in the accompanying solutions manual. My professor often mentions during class ""Your book is wrong here"" or ""This is a typo"" or ""This is what they meant to say."" I do realize that this is the first edition, but it seems almost as though the author wrote the book and never bothered to edit it. It's also quite wordy and usually a bore to read. Overall, the book stinks. Molecular Biology of the Cell 5 is more helpful in this class and it's not even a Genetics book."
0,Do not purchase!,"Only redeeming quality: disturbing suicide scenes. That's about it, folks. Even if you forgive the ridiculous plot, this movie lacks direction in every way--poor casting, awkward acting, horrible dialogue, confusing photography direction, lame story telling (tepid rising action, NO CLIMAX, and ridiculous denouement). You'll spend most of the time watching wondering how a movie with pretty big-name actors in it could be so bad. Wahlberg at his worst. The funny thing is: John Liguisamo is an oasis of good acting, which contrasts and UNDERSCORES how the sub-par performance by the others. It really feels like your watching a D+ college video project with a whopper budget. I love apocalyptic movies, don't get me wrong, but this one is an utter failure. Beware of the plants; ridiculous."
0,Dumb,Its a stupid and boring movie. Very predictable. Don't waste your time. I should have looked at the other reviews first.
1,baby necessity,"Definately cuts down on the smell, and holds quite a few before you have to empty it."
0,This is a reality nightmare,"I think this is the worst show on television, next to all those redneck reality shows. Abbey Lee Miller and her clients' mothers are among the most pathetic of humans and none of them should have been allowed to ever be around children. Abbey Lee Miller is just a big woman with a large mouth that just angles for a fight. The moms are self-absorbed and clearly are in this for the attention and seem to care more about exposure than their own children. To say you watch this as a guilty pleasure is an affront to humanity because there is nothing of merit on this show. Children get exploited for the adults' pleasure and to say you enjoy this means you truly are not looking at the greater picture. The kind of world these young girls are thrust into is a horrible one and I would be calling a social worker to have most of these girls removed from their parents. Shame on anyone who says this is great entertainment."
0,Its not a 6 pack,The product page is very misleading. Its not 6 pack. I ordered it and got only one in the shipment.
0,Delivery,"It took almost close to 3 weeks before I got the item, Amazon had the old address but I corrected it and sent an FYI to the seller and they acknowledge it but did not get to my present address till after like what I have mentioned close to three weeks."
0,I liked the old Anita better,"I bought this book hoping that Ms Hamilton would go back to writing actual plots and interesting cases for Anita, but alas I was sadly disappointed. All we get to hear about are Anita's romps in bed, and that she gets more power and has to have everyone possible explain it to her, over and over. Is there a plot to this? I am not sure. Not much happens until the very end of the book. I have been a fan of Ms Hamilton for many years, but her writing over the past few years has too much sex and not enough plot. I am sorry to say I have finally given up on a good book from her and won't be reading any more."
1,Great Projection Clock,"I bought this clock in addition to another projection clock from Oregon Scientific so I could take the the more basic one on vacation with me. This one had the outside temperature in addition to the time. I did have a little issue getting it on daylight savings time, but after that it seemed to work very well. The temperature seemed to take a while to stabilize, and it does seem to measure to the high side, but all-in-all, it works extremely well. The projection size of the digits are a little smaller but more precise than the Oregon Scientific but what a great device that allows you to see the time and temperature without twisting and squinting. I took a fall a few years back and am in a wheelchair making this a near necessity, especially on vacation. I would recommend these clocks to everyone."
1,I'm addicted,"I would have never thought to take a look, but a friend recommended Downton Abbey as a wonderful series, so i watched the first couple episodes of Season 1 - I became an addict. I got all caught up and am now waiting till each Sunday evening to watch the show as it airs on PBS. You probably don't have to watch all the past episodes to enjoy the show, but I would recommend it. They build the characters nicely - you love some and hate others. Also, besides the idea that the Earl and his family are very benevolent people (most wealthy folks of this era were not), the show seems to recreate the model and image of the classes in early 20th century England with historic accuracy."
0,Do not buy,"I though this was going to help me to stop my dog from barking so much , well it's not working . It's JUNK and it's not worth the money to send back. Do not buy ."
0,"Decent game, drm was a PITA","I tried the demo version a month ago, it was pretty cool. But the full version had all sorts of bugs in the installer. I don't understand why publishers pay so much money to license securom for their games, when it doesn't stop piracy at all! The DRM is frustrating for exactly ONE of the pirates, and for ALL the rest of the legitimate customers. The only people it doesn't bother are ALL of the pirates, and the few customers that don't realize how much simpler and faster the pirated version is.I feel like the people who add DRM to their games are saying ""The beatings will continue until morale improves."" The game itself was interesting, but hardly earthshattering. But I only had a few minutes to play it before bed, since it took me hours of work to install."
1,New-Comer,"So...quite a while back I burnt a cd at a friends and dl a faithless song and thought it was alright. But havent really thought about them again. While in search of a new cd in the import section at the record store this cd had a sample listening, since it has been #1 on the UK charts for several wks now. I remembered the particualr genre and gave it a listen. I went ahead and bought it and love it! This is the first cd I have ever had that I dance around to during the day but can fall asleep at nite to the same beats. This cd offers spunk and serentity."
0,Good Drive - but misses backing up key files!!!,"Install went OK. Drive runs OK. Backup backs up My Documents. However, I use FireFox and ThunderBird. All my favorites, bookmarks, e-mail and address books are in C:\Documents and Settings\Owner\Application Data\Mozilla and Thunderbird. I have chosen these subdirectories to be backed up many times, but Maxtor will not remember these settings. It wipes them all out except for My Documents. So if you want it backed up, be sure it is in My Documents.This is a real violation of trust. I probably should have given it zero stars, but it does seem to work on My Documents."
0,For Jarheads,"I too wasn't very impressed with Jarhead. I thought half way through that Jarhead seemed more like an insider movie for those who actually experienced the Marines, and perhaps other branches of the military. For those of us who haven't I just don't think there was enough direction to keep a lot of us interested. As someone else mentione. I too thought it was going to be a more modern version of Full Metal Jacket, but afte the first few minutes it was obvious it wasn't..."
0,Awful,"What a load of garbage. First of all getting though the boring yuck of his life story is just stupid. Then the story, parts aren't half bad. Getting interrupted by his italics was maddening. This book was not worth my money,time or effort. Save yourself!"
0,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"I expected a wonderfully illustrated book with great photography, but was very disappointed when the book arrived. Not only was it dull, the paper quality was poor. The amateurish illustrations were a joke. This is really not something to buy if you want some sort of visual reminder of the Towers or to commerate the horrific events on September 11."
1,Excellent!,I could barely put this book down! David Anthony Durham captures the passion and romance of ancient warfare/culture in a very powerful novel. The historical content is very accurate while also telling of fictional drama in hannibal's life. I would recomend this book to anybody who loves reading ancient history.
0,These tapes must be old,"I bought this tape for someone and they reported to me that it played back all funny sounding, like the tape was stretching. I cannot comment about the music itself as the tape was not for me. I am not much of a music critic anyway, but the tapes must have been made a long time ago on low quality tapes since playback is junk.I would look for it on CD or some other format that will survive time better."
0,Just OK,"I have to admit that the music was a lot more impressive with the visuals at the actual show. The music, I thought, would evoke those visuals but instead fell flat.It's nice enough music if you just want some noise in the background."
0,Slow and steady decline,"Reading Ilium was a rush of quirky excitement that set up a fantastic and rich world. Olympos slowly, SO slowly, saps everything that was interesting about Ilium towards an absolutely incoherent ending."
0,"""Requires Decorator Preferred Heating Core, sold separately.""","I have not yet used this product, so my 2 star rating has nothing to do with the quality of the product (since I am unable to rate it that way yet). But imagine my surprise when my shipment arrives, and I find that the paper insert in the cake pan states ""Requires Decorator Preferred Heating Core, sold separately."" Nowhere in the item description did it state that when I purchased this item, otherwise I would have ordered one then!! Now I have to wait for yet another order to arrive before I can use this... AND pay for extra shipping. Fabulous. Thanks a lot, Amazon.com!"
0,A little on the cheap side,"I like this pill planner mainly for it's shape. It's small enough that I can just stick it in my purse. Unfortunately, it's kind of cheaply made. When you lift one of the tabs, it will only open up a little bit for you. You can't force it open any further because the tab will just break off, which is what happened to me. The plastic ""hinge"" of the tab is just a stiff piece of plastic. It is not very pliable. So you can either slip in your pills through the little opening you can get, or try to open it further and risk breaking the tab right off. I would have otherwise been happy with the product."
1,Best thing I have ever read. Could not put it down.,"I have been reading romance for the past 12 years (everything from Barbara Cartland to Jackie Collins). I own every book ever written by both Jude Deveraux and Johanna Lindsey, and the romance of Patricia Coughlin is so much more original.I have a new favourite author."
1,They love them!,Bought theses for my 4yr old granddaughter but her sister who's 2yr old loves them also. We have fun rounding them up & there are enough for them to share. We kept the box so we know if we are missing one.
0,Cooked Rival Customer,"I purchased two of the 20 quart Rival cookers, one for myself and one for other family members in the Fall of 2002. It appears both units suffered a failure when cooking- they simply stoppped heating in less than 12 months after the purchase.Upon contacting Rival they offered to repair the units at $20.00 plus any shipping costs we would incur to get it there. This was hardly worth the time or money. The reason I write this review is to alert other consumers that this unit appears to be junk, though it worked well prior to the failure. Each product failed within a year of purchase... ironically within the same family. Sure, that's less than a scientific sampling- but its plenty of data for me.I totally agree with the concept of using such a device but would highly recommend consumers look for better quality. I regret my price driven purchase."
0,Machine doesnt froth the milk!,Read all the reveiws and I took a chance anyway...everyone how commented on the milk steamer was right. It doesnt work. One reveiwer said it worked if you moved the milk container around the steamer. Not for me!! RETURN..what a hassle. As usual though Amazon return poliy was flawless!
1,Awesome,"I bought this for my 10 year old Jimmy Johnson fan and he thinks it is the best lunch box ever. It is well constructed, holds alot of items and very adorable. This was a huge hit when it arrived in the mail."
1,Barbecue cover,Wow! This cover looks great and is made of heavy duty fabric. Way better than the usual black blob cover.
1,Read This Book!!!,This is argueably the best book of the genre that I have ever read. Whenever I get into any discussion of books this is the one I recommend.
0,Avoid at all costs,"I was drawn to this unit because it plays everything (including both DVD-audio and SACD formats) and is a five disc changer. Unfortunately, the unit is very slow to respond to commands, especially loading the discs and opening the tray. Moreover, the tray doesn't rotate or come out all the way, so it is very difficult to access the back two discs. More importantly, two units have failed on me (stopped responding to commands altogether) after a couple of weeks. I have had to send both units back to the distributor full of CDs/DVDs. This is a piece of junk!"
1,Kinda fun for the owner too!,"Wish it held a charge a little longer, but still a great little toy. Kinda fun for me too. Cat goes nuts with this little toy. Pay attention to how the mouse docks with the remote to charge it. Once you figure it out, it's easy. Can't wait to get off work and go play with this a bit more... maybe I'll let the cat play with it too!"
1,Buy it for the sayings of the Ammas,"The sayings of the desert mothers (the Ammas) are worth the purchase of the book. They are starkly beautiful and fresh. However, Laura Swan's commentary is predictable, dull and full of religious jargon and psychological cliche. Often the commentary loses sight of a particular Amma's ""saying"" entirely. Swan has a knack for missing the humor or irony in many of the sayings. I soon gave up reading Swan and simply read the Ammas' sayings -- and was more than rewarded."
0,Sorry I Bought This One,"Live and learn I guess. Don't get me wrong, this unit is powerful and the electric ran smooth. But there is no reason this thing should be so loud. I have to put plywood in front of it to deflect the sound. Tecumseh could have put a better and bigger muffler on this engine. They tested this motor when they made it, so they didn't realize it was so loud. Or did they decide to save a few bucks by installing an undersized ineffective muffler? As a builder, I start early and have many complaints from neighbors calling village halls about the noise. I even tried calling Tecumseh to see if this thing could be modified to make it quieter. Plus there is no excuse for the cheap plastic oil stick that come with this. The plummer I use has a Coleman Powermate with the same 10 hp Tecumseh motor with the cheap plastic oil stick. Same noise problem. So I can't blame Porter Cable other than their poor choice of using the Tecusmeh engine in this generator."
0,Otherwise Good Cover Ruined by Design Flaw,"I liked this cover until I brought my Nook on vacation, and had two occasions when the Nook fell out of the case. This happens because while two of the corners are held in with elastic straps, the other two straps are fashioned with strips of cloth that are sown in the shape of a pocket, and both of them quickly became loose with wear. Based on that problem, I cannot recommend this product."
0,A very poor DVD,"Video quality is so bad ( no star )that you wonder why they put it on DVD? Story is not much better. If you like tabloid type of gossip,it may be for you. ""AFI's 100 years 100 movies"" is a much better choice."
1,The excavation of a Neutral cemetery,"This is the archeological report published by the Royal Ontario Museum of the excavation of Neutral cemetery dating from c. 1640-1650 that was conducted at Grimsby, Ontario, Canada from October 1976 to April 1977. In total, 55 graves were discovered, from which the remains of 367 individuals were removed. The book deals with each grave individually, although in most cases the description consists of little than a short paragraph. Included are a number of figures and plates. All in all, the report gives one interesting insight into the lives and customs of the Neutral Indians, and a better understanding of pre-European occupancy of southwestern Ontario."
0,Nothing New Here,"This CD is just Sony recycling some of her previous recordings, nothing new here. I really enjoy Basia so I bought it without really looking at the contents, don't make the same mistake."
0,overpriced piece of junk,I cannot believe I paid eighty dollars for this worthless item! I really wanted to get one quickly and it was the only one I could find in BabysrUs. There are much better mats online for a fraction of cost! The interlocking mechanism does not work at all! I don't know how they came up with this idea-the pieces stop fitting together very quickly and my baby is now ignoring all his toys in favor of pulling this mat apart and putting it in his mouth which is unhygienic. Even my cats destroy the structure by getting underneath. Because of multiple small pieces you cannot move it around easily. There are many gaps in between and the squares loose thier luster after a week. I am getting a new one and will only keep a few squares for my cats to scratch-honestly thats all this mat is good for. Extremely dissappointed given high price.
1,Excellent book on how NOT to spam w/email,"Well, Dr. Lant has done it again! He knows marketing and he knows what works. This time he has put his genius to work with wisdom on how to put my business online with e-mail and not spam!E-mail Eldorado is easy to follow and gives good information on how to effectively use e-mail; build e-mail lists; use listservers and a lot more!Read it, you and your business will be glad you did!"
0,Greatly Surprised (UPDATE),"We had been looking for a patio ""sectional"" and were on the verge of paying much, much more. When the furniture arrived (in its 70# boxes), there were a few dings in a couple of pieces. I wasn't excited about shipping back the heavy freight, so I took some pictures and called Amazon. We made a deal we could both live with. The new furniture looks WONDERFUL. I would have preferred more cushion color choices, but we Scotch Guarded the light color and we'll see how it goes. VERY, VERY happy.UPDATE: When the price went way down, we ordered 2 more pieces to make the ""sectional"" larger. These pieces again arrived with slight damage, but that was far from the worst thing. The pieces are actually completely different. They are not built nearly as sturdy, the legs are a 1/2"" shorter and smaller in diameter. The cushions are completely different. I am still happy with the old pieces, but the new ones are horrible!! I would not buy these pieces now if I were you!!!"
0,"one down ,four to go ..","ok .. this is a total joke. someone please tell me is it really meant to be a movie?? i used to loath the spice jokes now i feel so sorry for them ,they must've realized finally that they have no talent at all whatsoeverthat they had to go and make this pathetic movie to make some money before people kicked them out..all i'm saying is that it was a waste of people's time and money ,and i don't mean us when i say""people"" but i mean the actors and the crew"
0,Having diffirent beliefs than republicans is treason.,"Oh my.The problem with Ann Coulter, is that her entire argument is that The Pledge of Alliance + The Flag + Strong National Defense = Patriotic, and that only by these standards can patriotism be judged. Appearantly, liberals ""hate the flag"" and are therefore are ""commiting treason"". And that liberals are constantly working against our country (I can only assume that by ""our country"" she means conservative ideology).She guages being patriotic as ""writing a patriotic song"" and ""serving in world war 2"". I doubt she's done either. (Though she does have an idea for such a song ""Good-bye Walla Walla I'm off to Smash Allah"") so being a patriot is promoting hate for the religion of others. If only I had known.So everybody, lets bust out our American flags, tanks, and hate for Islam, least we be call considered treasonists."
1,We don't walk without it,I love these treat bags. This is our third one. Both my husband and I wear one while walking our dogs. They are great for playing fetch in the back yard.
1,"Excellent, but don't buy alone","The heavy music with melodic vocals brought be to buy a copy. When I purchased this CD alone, I didn't care for it much. Cat's high voice grates on me half way through the album. After a while I started to like it enough to try the other two albums. All together, it suddenly sounded complete and balanced."
1,Doc Martin: Series 4,"I love the entire cast, especially the pairing of Martin & Louisa and love their accents. Louisa calls herself ""Louiser"" and so does Police Officer Penhale. Love it! The exchange between Louisa/Martin almost certainly makes me feel like they'll never make it, yet somehow this unusual couple come through and I'm not sure what makes them tick. Much humor and fun to watch. Love the fact that there's no violence, sex, or fowl language. Will always be missing Stephanie Cole. What a great character she played in the series."
1,favorite toy and means for exercise,"i admit that my dog has had many toys and destroyed most that came with squeakers. she is what they call a ""power chewer"". however, she loves these squeaky tennis balls AND does not try to wreck them. the only reason we need to replace them is because other dogs steal them (upstairs neighbor - the gig is up!!). seriously these are an obsession among dogs in our local park, and more importantly, keep my dog interesting in playing fetch longer than ANY toy. even the devil ball."
1,Dangerously In Love,"I remember this album when I was 16. This album is very diverse and the music is groovy and soulful. The musical influences from hip-hop to rock to jazz. The album is equally divided between seductive mid-tempos,lush ballads and fiery club bangers, providing a sharp focus on who Beyonce is right now as a performer,woman and as a creative force. This album is the sound of a grown woman clearly staking her claim in the world and redefining expectations of who she is. The vibe is more mature,more playful,more deeply passionate and sexually aggressive. This album has been certified 4x Platinum. Remember,this was 2003-2004."
0,This does NOT work !,"This product is a POS. It did fit in my phone, but it would not work. I tried several times, online, offline, updates, different computers, phone on, phone off. NOTHING worked. I'm glad I only lost the $8 total or whatever it cost me. I am not pleased in any way and I wouldn't even rate it the one star if I had the choice."
0,Not worth toilet paper,"This is a generic 'how to own a dog' template with a few initial breed specific passages and photos cut and pasted in from the Wikipedia and the AKC Belgian Sheepdog website. Nothing worthwhile or helpful to a new Belgian Sheepdog owner and the pages aren't perforated or soft enough for their most appropriate use...We did buy another book from Amazon, Belgian Sheepdog by Dr. Robert Pollet that was useful and well written. Try that one."
1,"Great for my 17.3"" laptop","It was such a relief to finally find a bag big enough for my Dell Inspiron. I love the way it looks - inside and out. The inside is a red suede that makes it really easy to find things in and it has a ton of pockets for organization. I have no trouble carrying my power cable and wireless mouse. There are also pockets that I can put my mP3 and cell phone in. The only problem I have is that it can be a little bit cumbersome if carrying it in a crowded area and can be uncomfortable on the shoulders if you have to carry it for a long period of time. Other than that, I absolutely love it!"
0,Worthless,"Just don't waste your money on this product. It WILL not work for anybody with any form of sleep apnea with resulting snoring problems. Wish it did, but it does not. Don't bother.Nozovent Anti-Snore 2 Box"
1,Great book,"Really enjoyed this one. Some great horror stories that only Stephen King is capable of writing, while also including a few non-horror stories. Also enjoyed how he went back to 'Salem's Lot a couple of times. Highly recommended."
1,Great tool,"As I am a novice to this ""art form"", it is refreshing to buy a book that explains the why and how's of the art, and the diagrams to show you how do do it. Good teaching tool."
0,Unimpressed,"This item arrived with one arm broken off:/ Also, I understand there are molding irregularities, but this Spiderman bank had SO MANY black streaks where it is supposed to be red or blue. I guess I can't complain too much since it was so cheap to purchase and is for a child. We fixed the arm ourselves instead of dealing with sending it back. Should work fine."
1,Our American friends cant get enough of them,Living in Spain its too expensive to buy these there and ship to America but buying from Amazon they're a very good price and as cheap as in the UK.
0,Honky Tonk Angel: The Intimate Story of Patsy Cline,"I just finished reading this book and I must say it took me quite a while to get through it. Not because it was difficult reading by any stretch of the imagination but it was just plain boring and rather tedious. There were times where I dreaded picking it up, but I am not one to quit, no matter how bad it might get.Either way I don't recommend this book and I also want to point out that the author himself reviewed this book. Is that ""legal"" over in Amazonland?"
0,Why the violence?,"I just can't understand why Disney/Pixar would produce a movie that is designed for 2-5 year old boys that is overrun with violence. Explosions, shooting... they even torture and kill (kill off-screen) Rod Torque Redline. Cars 1 was filled with heart. It was about friendship and small-town living. This is a James Bond movie with cartoon cars in place of actors. My 3 year old son was so excited to see this movie. Mater's Tall Tales is better than this movie."
0,Still picking up the pieces,"My main complaint is still the pieces falling off. My daughter doesn't drive it into the walls or hey MOVE IT, but yet it still falls apart. She still puts the Bratz dolls in it and has conversations with them but if Dana's shoe hits the door by accident, off goes the door. It still sits by the Disco cause if you remotely look at that thing wrong, it too falls to pieces. I think that the look is cute and the girls like that, but the parents are very sick of picking piece after piece up off of the floor."
0,Does not match description and took 2 weeks to arrive,"I ordered the 1000 count worms along with a Worm Factory 360 on a Monday (10/24) figuring that I would get it on Thursday or Friday so I can set it up before the weekend. Amazon sent out email with shipping tracking # indicating they are on the way. I received the Worm Factory on Friday but no sign of the worms. The kids were sorely disappointed. The worms didn't arrive till the following Thursday. When I opened the package, the worms didn't look very lively and it looked like there were maybe 100 worms in the bag... nowhere near the 1000 worms claimed by the description. I would have rated it zero stars if I could. Will not buy from them again."
1,Jeep Wrangler (Blue),"I am very pleased with this product. Not as expensive as the Jeep Hurricane, however serves it purpose. Goes 2.5 and 5 mph with lock out for beginners. opening door and a working radio. It also has velcro seatbelts. Very pleased. Purchased for my two children ages 2 and 4. They both enjoy driving, and being passangers. Charge initially for at least 18 hrs and never over charger for more than 30 hrs. Mine came with the battery and charger. Look before purchasing a play vehicle for your kids if the charger and battery come or are purcahsed seperately batteries are around 55.00, and chargers are about 25. This definetly increases the initial purchase price. Shipping was on time and assembly was not to difficult. Be sure to charge vehicle before showing the kids though.... C batteries for the radio must also be purchased seperately.Very Pleased. This vehicle also does well on grass."
1,could've been better,"includes the first four eps of season 2:ep 201 growing pains -- season opener, first appearance of the younger class (jubilee, cannonball, etc.), avalanche exposes the mutants to the school, but the professor wipes their mindsep 202 badda bing badda boom -- boom boom's father forces her to steal moneyep 203 power surge -- jean grey's powers threaten to overwhelm herep 204 fun and games -- the x-men throw a party while the professor is away, but a student named arcade accidentally stumbles into the danger roomextras inc: language features, episode intros by the director frank paur, and a few other things that i haven't checked yet, prob. just bios on the characters. all in all sort of disappointing, since the rest of the episodes from season 1 haven't been put out and the first 4 eps of season 2 were def. not the best of the season. still, it's better than nothing."
0,A Disappointment in Every Way!,"What an idiot I was buying this film. I guess if you're a fan of this ""Celeb"" and not Quentin Crisp, you may enjoy it. I was looking for more on Crisp, not this no talent actor."
0,WORST Quality Product EVER!,"I bought this item knowing we would need to keep track of our babies feedings and diaper changes for the doctor. This thing did not work out of the box! Half of the LCD segments did not work, and you could not set the current time, or turn on or set any timers. Very poor manufacturing and quality. If they improved the product it would be worth it, but don't waste your money! If it was possible, I would rate this item as a ZERO!!! Fortunately Amazon has 100% money back guarantee, including returning shipping costs. Thank you Amazon!"
1,"Encouraging, Entertaining, Educational","Encouraging, Entertaining, Educational!My beloved father suffered from Alzheimer's and I have written hundreds of articles and a book on the subject, so I understand very well the extreme range of emotions and experiences Jacqueline describes.

0,American Psycho equates to American Trash,"The review title says it all. This book blows. The only thing worse than this book is it's movie adaptation. Save your money and buy something worth while like ear wax, a pocket lint collection, or maybe even navel fuzz."
1,just right,"attractive enough for nice events, lightweight, closure is reliable, holds what is needed for a few hours: lipstick, kleenex, key, credit cards and license, cell phone, etc."
0,Look elsewhere for good vampire fiction (as if there existed nonfiction),"I will not bore you with complaining about the plot or lack there of. In fact that isn't even the largest gripe I have with this novel. Simply put, the writing is absolute dribble, in fact I'm sure that a real 17 year old in love with a vampire could have told her tale better. The entire book read like a really long (and especially poorly written) teen magazine article.I'm glad that so many people find this novel readable, but I recommend Mary Downing Hahn -I originally wrote Mary Higgins Clark, two many middle named marys- (Look for me by Moonlight), Bram Stoker's Dracula, or Nabokov's Lolita if you are looking for the forbidden love fantasy.I apologize for being such a lit snob, but I just was so disappointed with this book after loving the vampire romance genre as a teen and I want others to enjoy the good this genre has to offer."
0,Too Much Vibration of Plastic Shields,"The grinder seems stable at low, med and high speeds without the eye protective plastic shields. When the shields are installed (A NECESSITY), they vibrate very badly, making a loud noise. The shields are not secured well enough to the grinder. As a result, at high speed the vibrate as much as 1/2 inch or more! This puppy is going back.."

0,It's ok.,"This is an ok book, but it's a cheap take from ""The Wave"" when this story was originally written."
0,Warning,"This is normally a very good product. However, I NEVER received it when I ordered it at Amazon. I have sent a letter to the seller. I got back an unhelpful reply. I hope it will be resolved. I can not afford to throw my money away."
0,"plagiarism at its pathetic worst, amazing this kid hasn't been sued","If you were a 17 year old and had read Lord of the Rings, The Dragonriders of Pern and the Wizard of Earthsea you might go off and try to mix them into crappy prose.From McCaffery's dragonrider books:-the dragons are fully telepathic with their riders-the dragon dies when its rider dies but not visa-versa-a dragon will only ""bond"" with one personFrom LOTR:-Dwarves, elves, men, and ""orc"" looking things-evil sorcerers serving a ""dark lord""From Leguin:-""true names"" having magical power-several characters have EXACTLY the same name and descriptionetc etc.If I were any of those authors I would sue the pants off him, and while McCaffery said she was OK with it and even wrote some of the foreword for his first book, the second one encroached even more.Besides all of these morally-despicable reasons, the prose is awful and clunky."
0,This stinker does not deserve the accolades,"I was very disappointed with this movie for one reason...not enough zombies!It starts out great and Jessee Eisenberg is a very likeable actor (he ""made"" Adventureland). The movie starts out great with his character's rules for dealing with a zombie culture. The problem is, that once the four main characters get together, there's too much talking and not enough zombies.Woody Harelson was interesting and the Bill Murray cameo was great. ""Shaun of the Dead"" knew how to integrate horror and comedy but this movie quickly morphed into an uninteresting ""road movie"" I know this is not supposed to be highbrow entertainment but I was expecting much more from this. The trailer truly shows you everything you need for this one."
1,One of the best toys by far out there ! Great Value + No Batteries + Son's Favorite!,"Ok, if I uploaded a video of my 8 month old pushing this toy around I think it would sell out immediately. He has every toy imagineable and this is by far either his favorite or top 3. He plays with it daily. Colors are great, the rattle noises amuse him and he loves to push it around. He cannot yet master how to push it and make it go, mommy helps him but he still loves it. Fantastic toy!"
0,Don't waste your time,I was keen on using the MyPod with our new Senseo but was disappointed from the start. I filled the MyPod (1 1/2 spoons) with our best coffee ground to the same consistency as the Senseo coffee pods and all that we got was essentially brown water. No nice froth or taste.Don't waste your time or money.
0,Terrible sound,"i bought the version with the pictures on the lp's. it's a really cool collector item, but aside from that the audio is horrible. it's completely hyper-compressed. there is no dynamic range what-so-ever. it literally made my heart hurt when i first put the needle to the vinyl. to know i wasted all that money on a crappy remastered version. how can they justify ruining such a masterpiece? if you are looking for it as a collector's item then go for it. but if you want it because you don't have the original nevermind album don't waste your money. find the original somewhere or even the 180 gram re-issue. my advice is if any album says re-mastered then avoid it completely."
1,Captivating-Read It In One Sitting.,"I finished this book in one sitting--could not tear myself away from Wurtzel's stories about her travels into the abyss of depression. Good book for someone who has either experienced depression or needs to gain greater insight into the nature of depression. However, the title is somewhat inaccurate considering that Prozac is not even discussed until the last few chapters--so if the reader is looking for a book about Prozac/or an individual accounting of the effects of Prozac try another book. This book is about Wurtzel herself and her life in dealing with depression."
1,Excellent,I purchased this book as a beach book and was not disappointed. This is the first work I have read by this author and immediately after finishing Four Seasons began to search for more books by her. This was a wonderfully woven tale of family tragedy and triumph as well as individual growth within the protagonists as women and as sisters.
0,Yikes!,"Rip-off! Some of the later songd like ""If You KNow What I Mean"" are reproduced in thir graceful studio versions, but many iof the classics, like ""Sweet Caroline"" are mauled beyond recogition in ""sing with me"" 1990's state fair type live renditions. Flee from this vomitorium."
1,Just What I Ordered - and FAST!,"This is just a standard set of feeler blades. I lost my old set and haven't missed 'em for 20 years. These were priced right, they have legible sizes marked on each blade, and I think I'll get my spark plug gaps, starting point for my points, and valve clearances set correctly with them.Nice product."
1,Great Product,"I've had this mouse for around 3.5 years and it has outlasted my previous laptop. Battery lasts a good deal of time, 3-4 months, depending on how often I use it, and takes just 1 AA battery (also, to note, it must conserve power as I generally leave the USB plugged into my laptop). Also the mouse works great on various surfaces and fits perfectly in my hand. It's clicking is a little louder than I would prefer, but completely tolerable. The only con, is that upon trying to install the drivers on my new laptop, is that the software is not compatible with Windows 7. However, the mouse is still functional, including the general scrolling of the wheel (up, down, left, right) but has lost the functionality of the side button. Still plan on continuing use with this mouse."
0,"""Xperience""?","I must say that this is not 'happy hardcore'. I was seduced by the low price and title and went ""okay, this will be cool'. It's really not. It's more techno then anything else, and not even good techno at that. If you want happy hardore, I suggest anything in the 'Happy 2b Hardcore' realm, especialy chapters 1,2,and 4, Happy Hardcore Hysteria; Happy Hardcore Foundation,Vol 1 and Vol. 2. Anything can be better then this."

0,Dear Walt Disney! Do you think we're fools???,"First of all: I LOVE this movie!!! I give it five stars and more! But what is your problem with selling a perfect DVD to make your buyers happy? I saw the movie years ago in Germany in the original format and language. The beautiful Song: ""When love is gone"" was in that movie and the whole film was obviously in Widescreen format! So... what is your problem to release the DVD with these features. Do you want to make even more money, by saying in a couple of years: ""Sorry, we made a mistake. But here's a new DVD with all of the features for ONLY xx.xx$?I'd recommend to all of the fans: ""DON'T BUY THIS DVD!!!"" Don't play into the hands of these big corporations!!!"

0,Awful telescope,"This is one of the worst telescopes i ever owned.The instructions are extremely confusing, and the mount shakes in the smallest breeze. The finderscope barely works, and it comes with two cheap, plastic eyepieces and mediorce optics. I would reccommend getting a six inch dobsonian telescope from celestron or orion instead of this christmas trash scope"
0,Do not waste your money,"When I purchased this book I was hoping to receive a manual discussing ""Home Automation and Wiring"" instead I received a mish mash of very low tech information. Out of 322 pages I found only 7 items that were remotely useful. The book has no cohesive flow, the author jumps from subject to subject. I would strongly recommend purchasing ""Structured Wiring and Design Manual"" by Robert N. Bucceri."
1,In depth material other books don't cover,I found this book useful in understanding some of the fundamental issues as well as the implementation sections. Our team has been doing medem design for years and this gave a new perspective compared to other dsl books that are very similar in content.
0,"A ""bit"" dangerous","I couldn't wait to finally be able to use this expensive bit that has sat in my Raised Panel kit for years now. I followed all the rules. I purchased a high end router table and installed a 2 1/2HP variable speed router as recommended. It took about 12 passes to safely accomplish a single profile on one edge of a 10"" piece of poplar. Even with the smallest adjustments, there were still some break out and kick-back. I'll go back to my nice safe vertical raised panel bit. This bit looks great, very large, and it will end up being a very expensive display piece in my router bit collection. Stick to the vertical bits. I was very disappointed in this one, and it's definitely not worth the money."
0,The stupidest waste of time and money ever,"When people say this was recorded with a shitty camera, they are not lying. It looks like a cheap cellphone camera, the acting is TERRIBLE and the entire mood of the movie will leave you uncomfortable. I can't believe I wasted $2 on this movie, it isn't even worth a free download. I did not even watch 5 minutes into the movie it was so bad. I don't even want to think about the stupidity I just watched."
0,Umm...TRICK TRAINER - I get it now,If you are buying this dog because you were looking for a moving - walking talking type toy - you are sadly mistaken. The decription for this toy is HIGLY misleading. It does not do any tricks and you can't train it. I was thinking like maybe a furby type action would be taking place. Instead when I got it - It is a stuffed animal with magnets in its paws and nose. So you can make the toy move with the magnets but it does not really do anything like it claims to. The TRICK was they got you to spend 25 dollars for it - thinking it was going to be trainable like the nindendogs game is. I would recommend that the company pursue making an actual working dog along these lines. Rather than what I got from them.

1,KC OK,"A good,clever plot.John Payne,usually playing light leading men,ys very convincing as a desperatr ex-con trying to proove his onnocence.excellent suppoert from Lee Van Cleef,Neville Brand snd Jack Elam as a trio of justifiably paranoid heavies.My only cavil is the Hollywood happy ending,whish forsed the character played by Payne to allow himself to become a better person via the love og a good,and un-necessary(for this filn) good woman."
0,Flat Ugly Cookies,"First of all in the first few pages of the book states that these recipes are not the same recipes used in Mrs. Field's cookie stores reason being the store has commercial ovens and uses specially made ingredients for them.I have baked many batches of cookies and I was really taken back by how much butter the recipes was calling for. I followed the book to the tee. I even tested and made sure the oven was the perfect temperature, and used a scooper that makes perfect tablespoon sized balls. and all I got was flat ugly cookies. I made a second batch immediately afterwards thinking I might of overmixed. Same results!I suspecting the amount of butter is the cause of the flat cookies. I definalty think the recipes need adjustments.I'm sorry to say that I really trusted the recipes because of the name on the book.Duh! why would a million dollar francise sell the very recipes that makes the real dough."
0,False advertising,When I went to purchase I investigated all details. On the video it showed a VR/ stabilizer switch which made me believe there was one. But now when I shoot far the picture is blurry because there is none.
1,Almost like home,"This British comedy is no longer shown on PBS where I live and I've really missed watching it! Inasmuch as I live in an Assisted Living home, it is even more entertaining now. There are so many similarities to reality in both plot and personalities. What fun!!"
1,Excellent,This was given as a christmas present. We are currently still watching it on the weekends. If you were a fan of the series then you have to get the complete set. We love it.
1,Surprisingly Good,"I liked this movie, although I was skeptical. I just couldn't see tough guy Vin Diesel in a Disney movie, but he pulled it off. He played a good character that (like most movies) started out as a big tough guy who didn't like kids, but learned to love them in the end. A few pretty funny moments and some nice fighting scenes helped this movie get 4 stars from me. Bottomline I liked it."
1,Sushi your way,Gave the book as a gift to a sushi enthusiast and they gave it high praise. They are excited about trying some of the examples.
1,Excellent overview.,"A reporter's perspective on the race to the Moon. Lots of facts and interesting ""stories."" Doesn't cover everything, but does convey the suspense and the many ups and downs (mainly from the U.S. side)."
1,i would give it a higher rating if i could,"i was disapointed by TCD i thought that it was a rushed album, and it had very little to say. Emo proved that Ben was just saving up for the masterpiece. very rarely does an album come along that lets the listener truly connect with the artist and in this case writer. you can feel what Ben has been through and how his life has changed through realizations (Let Go!) He put all of himself out there for us on this one, and the album as a whole reminds me of the writing in Every Night, from Anthem. for those moaning that it is not fast enough, go back and listen to Boogada again.......i'll listen to Emo."
0,HEY - why can't we have ZERO stars ?,"HORRIBLE! HORRIBLE! HORRIBLE! I received this camera as gift a little over 2 years ago. It went belly up AGAIN - shows the Camera Error #E45 like the other guy said. It had done it once before where the lense got stuck and I couldn't take any more pictures nor could I shut the stupid thing down. So the junk went back to kodak and they stated that the issue was the on/off switch. They indicated that the on/off switch was causing the problems because it would turn on while it was in the bag (or purse) and thus, ruin the lense ??? ANYWAY ... the switch was replaced so you had to push a button in order to turn on the stupid thing. Well it broke AGAIN! Now this is only several months after they supposedly ""fixed"" it ... unless my purse figured out how to push the button .... hmmm .... VERY VERY VERY poor quality! I was more than happy to trash it. Not worth the time or the effort of getting it repaired."
1,Nice toy,"I know I still have a lot to learn about this and Ipods in general. But I got mine about 2 months ago. EVerything is still working fine. I suggest you do get a case when you purchase yours as it can scratch easy - but then again, what device doesn't scratch easily?The only thing I miss about my iRiver MP3 player was that it really did organise th music according to artists, where the iPod seems to use not just the main artists but also whoever else sung with him/her...I'll get used to it.So yea, worth the money and if you take care of it, I'm sure it will give you many hours of joy as it has been doing for me."
0,Snooze Wood,"I came into this movie expecting something other than what was delivered and I suspect that this may have impacted my overall enjoyment of the movie. From the very beginning Wake Wood has a truncated quality to it which makes it difficult for the viewer to connect with the poorly realized characters and their situation -- almost as if the film makers felt that the initial tragedy would be sufficient to buy the viewers interest and sympathy for the whole of the movie.Wake Wood inhabits an uneasy space between a mystery, occult thriller, and slasher film and manages to fail on all three counts though if it had simply focused on the occult thriller aspect there were a number of intriguing ideas that were barely explored and seemed to exist as window dressing though they were by far the most interesting aspects of the film."
0,Manual tuning disappoints,"I expected more for a $50.00 radio from Sony. It's difficult to find radio stations, because there's no scanning or automatic tuning. (Two months ago I bought a no-name radio for two dollars and fifty cents that had automatic tuning - I just assumed Sony would offer this feature.) Reception is only OK. Also, the manual tuning is limited. You can only change the frequency by 1/10 (from 98.7 to 98.8). Often, the best reception would be in between (let's say, 98.75) and you can't get the best reception. Cool design. Like the mega bass. But a radio for jogging without automatic tuning/scanning is a bad investment. Don't buy it."
1,Best Price,"My husband has always been a fan for the Sketchers Critics. He loves the fit and the fact it can go with almost anything. The price was the best price I have seen from any website, or store. I will definitely continue to buy his shoes through this website."
0,not comprehensive,"I found this guide barely scratches the surface of travel possibilities in Botswana, offering few choices within each price range, and scant historical or cultural information. If you plan to visit only northern Botswana or the Central Kgalagadi (as most tourists so) then better to purchase the Bradt guide, which even after 2 years in Botswana, I still find interesting. The sight seeing and accomodation information in Lonely PLanet guide is meager at best, offering few choices. In Botswana, the best and most interesting places are off the beaten path, and Lonely Planet did not bother to find many of them for their readers. If you plan on visting southern or eastern Botswana (near Gaborone or Selebi-Phikwe) then buy a guide that includes South Africa, Zimbabwe and Namibia as well. This guide was fairly useless to me and has hardly left my bookshelf in the 2 years I've been in Bots! For a truly enjoyable holiday, buy a different guide."
1,"Interesting material, not very well written.","The subject is great, as is the material presented. But the way it is written seems choppy at times. As well, there are many instances of poor word usage. Either the writer or the editor was in a hurry - or both."
0,How NOT to edit a book,"I agree with everyone else that the book has some value, but not worth more than $10. The Wiley site is unresponsive to the feed back and judging from the amount of time that has elapsed since it hit the shelf, the publisher dosen't care. There's no errata sheet to download. I'll certainly keep this publisher's name on a post it on the monitor to AVOID future purchases."
0,This is just what we need...,"Yeah, we really need more war and more religious extremists with weapons. Did you ever pause to think that maybe ""they"" think they are just as well and that the word ""righteous"" is subjective?"
1,America of the 90s.,"Their first studio album in a decade and a very strong effort. Dewey Bunnell's songs are especially strong. Best cuts include Whole Wide World, Young Moon, Call of the Wild, and Sleeper Train. The song Hope was adopted as the theme song for the T.J. Martel foundation and was nominated for a Grammy. I cannot understand why this album wasn't a hit at Adult Contemporary stations. Truely an undiscover treasure."
1,Solid historical mystery,"I'll take the easy way out and agree with the reviews that preceed mine. It was a good, solid read with interesting characters that can hold there own. I am intrigued by the child that was interoduced as I don't often seen those issues addressed in historical mysteries. One quibble, I'm tiring of the plot line that this book takes. For whatever reason, it's become commonplace in period mysteries. You don't need to shock me to maintain my interest. Also, the comments of the other reveiwers that this book is similiar to the Anne Perry books is what influenced me to order and they were right on. Thanks for helpful reviews."
0,Sony FC9 A Defective Paper Weight,"I purchased this product when it first came out, for 1 year no problems, after the 1 year warranty the system freezez up its due to the overheating at the bottom of the unit, well I still have the thing what I did was remove the bottom cover drilled about 25 small holes this has been keeping the unit cooler this seems to do the trick for me also I made some custome legs giving it a custom 5""m lift witch adds to the cooling after owning it for now 6 years and having so many problems I think its time for an upgrade I think I will keep away from sony for a while"
1,Saddle UpTime to Ride,"This game is excellent, and really enjoyable. However i am having problems completing the section which has the wheel in. Can anyone give me any helpThanksAmy"
1,a intresting album,i love this album so much one of the best rock opearas ever its a romantic tale about losing the one he loves and fighting to bring her back and in the end being together again i recommend this to everyone its sad but in a good way very entertaining i love the lyrics and the beat is very uplifting and somewhat goofy very cool!
0,"Unrated, one of the most repugnant films of all times!!!","When I saw ""Last House"" the first time, I almost puked...This film is violent, offensive, disturbing, gruesome,sick, bad, and ...The acting is bad, the cinematography is awful,the story is a means to an end and the music isterrible... the whole movie just STINKS!!!!One my list of the worst films of all times!!!!Just bad!"
1,Baby It's JoJo,"JoJo is one of my favorite artist and when this CD came out I went to target on the day it came out at 11:00, i had to have it. The best songs are...well lets just say the only song i dont like is ""use my shoulder"". One review I read said that the songs sound the same. I must admit that most of the songs sound alike but this is still a great album. Breezy will get you up and dancing and Never Wanna Say Goodbye will make you happy. JoJo has proven to me that she is straight up rnb. I think we'll be seeing JoJo for a while, JOJO IS EVALASTIN!"
1,Excellent Software for the Anime Artist-in-Training,"My granddaughter is a junior at the High School for Art & Design, majoring in Anime Illustration. This software is an excellent springboard to sharpen her artistic skills. Thank you."
1,Love my Dirty Dancing DVD,"This limited edition Dirty Dancing Keepsake DVD collection is a must for all fans of this movie. It has not only the movie but lots of additional footage, interviews, and even screen tests of Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey."
1,Another use,"I use this to spray the siding on my home when there's mold. It does what I need it to do, which is spray bleach and water to the 2nd story of my home."
0,the switch is junk,"I have read other reviews here about the switch being bad, doesnt anybody at dewalt ever follow this and see what customers are saying about your products and then fix the problems? The sander is good but the switch is a piece of s*** pardon the french. Also to Amazon forward this to dewalt. Garver brown Chetek WI"
0,Order the next bigger size!,"I ordered a size US 10, but it fits way too snug, and I can only get the strap to the first notch. The ChampsSports return policy is more trouble than it's worth. Save yourself some grief and order a size larger."
1,Still the Favorite,"We got this for our 4 year old Cars fanatic for Christmas and it is still the favorite gift. He plays for hours with this toy. There are a couple parts that fall off when he shuts Mac together, but it is an easy fix. I actually think it is good that they made it that way, I would rather it be flexible and easily put back together than rigid and broken. Definitely a must for your Cars fan!"
1,Beautiful Baby Book for your son/daughter,"I was so glad to receive this before my son gets here and before my baby shower so I can write things in it! I got the matching photo album and keepsakes chest as well, and all items are high quality and so cute! I would recommend buying them together as they don't always seem to be in stock and are the cutest out there! :)"
0,"Okay, but not NEARLY as good as the other books...","Anna was a great heroine but not due in any way to Morvan, who made her feel inferior and saw fit to humiliate her at every turn. I don't know how this guy even ended up in a story by this otherwise great author. He was truly unlikable."
1,Leckie was part of the DVD Series Pacific as he fought in the Pacific,"Leckie like Sgt Basilone and several others are advisors that were used in the making of the WWII Classic Pacific,This book was written about him and his adventures as he fought the Japs in the Pacific War, It's a riveting book that if you are a WWII buff you will enjoy reading and adding to your libraryIt's a keeper ..."
0,Poorly constructed and designed toy,"This toy is poorly constructed and designed unlike many other Radio Flyer classics. It smells like a chemical factory coming out of the box for one. Secondly, as many stated in other reviews, the turning radius is awful and makes it virtually un-maneuverable. All four wheels were wobbly and the whole thing had a cheap feel to it. Its a slick looking toy but thats about it."
1,Awsome Reading,"I do a lot of reading and I love James Patterson's books but when I found J.A. Jance's books I thought I would give them a try and I have to admit she is the female version of James Patterson. Her books keep you in suspense and have you reading until you get to the end. So far I have gotten the whole J.P. Beaumont series and they are all have you wondering ""what's going to happen next."" I would recommend her books to anyone that loves to read. Believe me you won't be disappointed, they are one of the best fiction novels I've read in a long time.Linda"
1,Prequel,Prequels usually don't interest me but this was excellent! Bring out more. I recommend you put old TV series that are finished be put on sale.
0,Were Number 1!!!,i compleatley agree with pat buchanan and his well argrued book. keep out all foreiners!! serbias will should come to US AND clear out and do what they did to muslims as well to nonwhites. This country should be kept pure Anglosaxon or else: decline. Truth to tell.
0,Not that good,"The intention was good, but the execution leaves something to be desired. And I like a lot of these bands, too. If you want to hear some really cool punk bands do the Clash, check out Backlash: Tribute To The Clash. It's much better than this lame attempt."
0,in the arcade you can spend as many quarters as you like,"HOD2 lives up to its billing as a fast action shooter. It does so, however, by ignoring everything else that a game should offer. Other reviews understate the necessity of the laser gun. The aimer simply moves to slowly to allow for any reasonable chance of success. There is no free will, or choice in this game. The only way gameplay affects storyline is to open doors that lead to diversions from the VERY scripted plot. The acting is a complete joke, leaving this reviewer wondering what was lost in the translation. Most disappointing, however, is the notion of credits. You cannot extend play for longer than nine credits, great in the true-to-the-arcade-game translation except that in the arcade no-one is going to limit you to nine plays. This creates a hopeless expectation of perfection to actually finish the game and dooms players to playing the first screens over and over again. not much fun."
1,"Pretty Standard, Could Be Better","OK, it's a casebook. By definition it is just a bunch of cases thrown together to demonstrate various areas of the law. But lately there has been a new trend in books for 1Ls... analysis. Sure, this book has ""Notes"" sections between the cases, but they are little more than hypotheticals or one-line versions of even more cases. What about some essays? Talk about the logic behind the cases or maybe mix in some Law and Economics theory. As a generic casebook this is quite good, but adding a little more than just cases would be outstanding."
0,Save your money for a betterbook,"Got to agree with the other reviewer(s), if this had zero starts, that'd be my rating.I'd like to encourage Tom to continue writing, as his articles published in well know trade magazines are quite good."
0,Android 18 vs. Bio-Blob. Sorry I mean Bio-Broly.,"Broly is back again...sort of. He has been brought back to life through advanced technology. This time he's more like a big blob monster or something. If you've seen the Blob or Godzilla versus the Smog Monster you can pretty much get an idea what Broly is like this time around. Trunks, Goten and Android 18 team up to fight the resurrected Broly. He's finally defeated. That's about it. This movie is honestly a waste. The Broly movies got progressively worse and finally ended here. I can't in good conscious recommend this film to anyone. It's a waste of money and space on your shelf. There's nothing redeeming about it. You may as well keep on shopping."
0,Wrong One,"Although this is a quality book and I love Calvin and Hobbes, I ordered Library Binding and was sent a Paperback book in sub par condition. Bought from SPL Management, LLC."
1,Intermatic HA04C outdoor wireless lighting module,Works great with my Home Settings remote. Easy to add and runs well so far over the last 3 weeks
0,"Ah, screw this one, lets watch Ayane's High Kick!","I admit it, the animation WAS good, but it DEFINETLY didn't compare to Slayers or Tenchi Muyo. The action was a total sleeper, unlike Slayers or Tenchi Muyo. And there was a bit TOO much unnecessary nudity and cursing, VERY unlike Slayers or Tenchi Muyo. Basically, guys, what I'm saying is, take the money you were gonna use on this, and buy Slayers or Tenchi Muyo instead."
1,Awesome!,"Overall, this is a incredible gun! I should not have been mad when I bought this, I chose the wrong seller. Awesome gun, though! Worth $15!"
0,Was This Really Meant to Be Published?,"Sylvia Plath was a mentally sick person who was encouraged by one of her psychiatrists to write. I have seen photographs of her and Ted Hughes, and Sylvia is in an appaling state. I can't even relate what Sylvia is doing in one of the photographs. It's sad. I hope that she found some comfort in writing, but honestly, was this meant to be published?It's not a surprise that many readers find this repulsive. English teachers/professors should not require students to read this; it goes against every basic human tendency to be happy and not to be anti-life. I don't know how else to put this but the best writers aren't suicides. Don't read them. Their opus is one long goodbye note."
0,The Bad Girl is a Pretty Bad Book!,"Fear Street has always held me captive with it's tales of normal teenagers mixed up in terrifying situations.I never thought I would dislike a Fear Street story, but I really am NOT KEEN on this one.I can almost believe in the tales of ghosts and psychos.But this one is just ridiculous.I couldn't wait for it to be over.It is about 2 teen girls who discover the formula to bring living beings back to life.The person or animal who was previously dead is now a monster and eventually explodes!!!!!!If this had been my first experience of Fear Street I would never have read the other books!It's kind of suspenseful but mostly not the one I would recommend."
1,Greatest little device,"The magnifying light is wonderful. I bought one for myself and my husband saw it and wanted one. I had tried a few other lights that would fit in my purse, but this was the right size with the right amount of light. Highly recommended."
0,Can I please get my money back?,"I actually had high hopes for this book when I hit the button to submit my order. As soon as I read the forward I knew that I'd be gotten.This another yet book that seeks to explain the UFO phenomena as Satan and Lucifer driven, by hey another 'author-prophet' narcissist who claims to have been the SOLE recipient of this info and that it was given by God.My biggest problem is that this book is all over the place. And the author seems to tie in all the major conspiracies. JFK, Roswell, Chemtrails, The New World Order, Noah's Flood, The Illuminati and Planet X and The Catholic Church. You name it it's in here. And all are part of Satan's grand scheme. But the Author doesn't provide one piece of supporting evidence other than known hearsay and the now classic ""God Told Me So.""I picked up this book because of an interest in bible code 'technology'. Yet none of that is in here. No screen prints to show a cross matrix or any kind.Don't waste your money on this one...."
1,Sanus Audio rack,This is the second Sanus product I have purchased. They were extremely easy to assemble and look great. The construction is excellent and does not in any way alter the quality of the music.
1,Empire of the Sun,"I have seen the movie taken from this book but found that,whilst it was enjoyable, the book has bought out the suffering of Jim during his capture more effectively. Most enjoyable read."
0,"Small set, not worth $44 unless you're a collector","My son ordered this set with a gift card thinking that because of the price it was a large set. It is only about 100 pieces. It was originally sold in 2005 for only $9.99 so keep that in mind. If you're a collector, it is a great set but if you're ordering it for a child to play with, prepare for tears and disappointment when they see how small it is.I personally think the number of pieces and rarity of the set should have been made VERY clear in the description. Every Lego box has the number or pieces on the front of the box and you can see in this picture it is not there. If it had been, we would have realized that it is nowhere near a big as the box and price makes it out to be."
0,Bad Taste,I'm not sure whats wrong with this companies dispensers - I've tried both this version and the smaller version (replacement) and they both added a very district plastic/metalic taste to each glass of water.The cold water system doesn't work as well either. Amazon should really look into getting rid of this companies products altogher.
0,Horrible film.,"I tried to bring myself to like it, but I can't. With Sean Connery in the cast, I expected a lot out of this film, but it's got a bad script and the direction seemed more tailormade for special effects rather than the acting. The humor in it sucks (example: Tom Sawyer is ""checking out"" the vampiress, and Allan says ""She's out of your league."" League! As in League of Extroadinary Gentlemen!"" HA. Not funny.). In fact, at the theater, PEOPLE WERE LAUGHING AT THESE DUMB JOKES. As I said, the direction is horrid, which is even worse since it's the director of ""Blade"" (Stephen Norrington), and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Bland acting, average special effects, horrible script, heavyhanded direction, and ludicrous plot devices (how is a domino effect stopped by the destruction of ONE building??) all add up to one stupid film. Watch other comic book films instead. You might negatively vote, but chances are, you are out of MY league. And my league is ultimate."
1,Expensive but Worth It,"I own these & use them frequently. Before baking, I prepare the pans by oiling them very lightly; breads are easy to unmold. I love being able to use metal utensils with the stick-resistant surface. Clean-up is a breeze. I use a nylon brush, then follow up with a sponge. I expect these pans to last a lifetime."
1,"Unfortunately a bad title, but a great read!","Don't let the title throw you off. This is a great book about Pole Shifts. Personally, I agree with the current Geological Thought on this matter - which is that pole shifts do occur and that they have occurred in the past. Where I disagree with the current historical philosphy is that the pole shifts do not alter regional climate and thus impact civilizations. That is where this book comes in. It makes a long standing and firm argument for periodic catastrophic events. The book documents the points and theories in an enjoyable manner and is a quick and easy read. This is a MUST READ book for anyone interested in the mysteries of ancient civilizations and geologic processes. I rate this book most highly."
0,Simple to the point of no learning,"At first it is appealing because of its simplist approach, but upon further reading it becomes apparent that this book tries to simplify the material to the extreme. The book suggests if you ""just"" memorize the anagrams and analogies you will pass the RDMS.... It doesn't care if you understand the principles and doesn't give you the information to understand the concepts -- just tries to give you simple examples for you to memorize. I take offense as this approach suggests sonographers are too slow to learn anything more than silly diagrams and memorization tricks."
0,Waste of time.,"A lot of reviewers who like this movie tell people who didn't like the movie to read the book. Why read the book when we are trying to watch a good movie? Let's be honest here. The movie has a lot of fans but it is a bad movie to an average person who is happy with life. I watched it thinking it is a modern classic or something, but what a disappointment. Don't watch the movie unless you have nothing to do."
1,Way to go Disney!,This movie was awesome! I think it is very close to how Robert Louis Stevenson would have done it if he had done it in the future. Morf was hilarious! I loved the scene where Jim was solar surfing - VERY cool.
1,Well made Flag Bracket,This is actually a Bronze Flag bracket with a nice Nickle plate over it. I would buy it again. The only problem I found was that the three holes to attach it are kinda close together under the bracket. It would have been a better idea to put two hole underneath and then one attach point above the bracket to help distribute the weight over a bigger surface.
1,Good enough for my daily usage,"Only one obvious defect is while the earloop installing on the headset, it's unable to fit into the charger and I have to take the earloop off every time for charging. However the problem is the earloop is very weak. After several times of intall and uninstall, it just broke.But the headset itself is perfect for this price."
1,undinied proof of Bible history,"I love this because it gives proof without a doubt to those who do not believe and to as Christians makes our faith stand. This Documentary shows in big detail what its most likely the evidence of the Israelites Exodus through the Red sea. This is very emotional to even think that after so many years, this items are still here for us to see, even nature decided to keep and preserved as a testimony of the works of God. Amazing."

1,Schubert as it should be,"Exquisite performance on magnificent instruments. Leaves any other performance, especially of the Rondo well behind All who listen to it at our place borrow it, so now I have to buy my seventh copy."
1,Remarkable story,"I read this book many years ago when it first was published. The thing that really stood out to me was that my husband was born just about a week later than Sergei Kourdakov and I kept thinking how different our lives were here at the same time Sergei was living in Russia. The girl, Natasha, that was beaten so much and then would be at the next meeting when Sergei would raid it was so brave. I kept thinking that she probably didn't realize what an impact her life had on this man and will only know the extent of her faith and how she was the reason for Sergei to come to know Jesus when she finally reaches her heavenly reward..what a courageous lady she was! This book is one that I have read over and over and recommend it to everyone!"

0,"Turtles now teenagers, lack Karate skills","This product doesn't work as well as I would have hoped. I kept three cans in a terrarium with my 4 pet turtles for two years (starting when they were 11). Today, while they are definitely teenagers, they completely lack the following:-Any kind of karate skills-Prounounced valley accent-Tendency to fight crime-Dislike of my paper shredderThere may have been an effect, however, as three of my turtles now seem to enjoy pizza."
0,3D version not worth looking at for me.,"the 2D version picture is outstanding and this is a really great movie.too bad the 3D version don't look anywhere near as good as the 2D version on blu-ray.in 3D the colors look kind of washed out and it doesn't have as much details in the picture.one more problem i have with the 3D version is that it skips a lot and repeats the same part over and over,i have to fastfoward just to keep it from skipping."

1,A Great Primer!,"A great cookbook or coffeetable book, this book is bold in color and full of interesting information about the intersection of Indian food and culture- all presented in the form of a cookbook.I highly reccomend this and a trip to a local international grocery for anyone interesting in learning to cook indian food! It's extremely rewarding.My 2 biggest tips:1. DO NOT buy your spices at an American grocer, go to international markets. Price and quality are far superior2. If you are not used to extremely hot food, or have heartburn, just cut the chillies out of the recipes or moderate them."
1,This is a life changing book.,I was given a galley proof of this work when I left college. I owe much of my success as a product engineer to these principles. It taught me a babancing consideration before I am compulsively driven to offer an operational fix to a minor problem. This ought to be part of any social science curriculum.

1,Amores Perros,"Bleak and brutal, Iñárritu's ""Perros""--literally, ""Love's a bitch""--takes Tarantino up a notch with a story of crime, betrayal, and abuse set in the rough-and-tumble slums and posh, sanitized condos of Mexico City. Filmed in grainy light to accentuate the hard edges of the story's interconnected plots, ""Perros"" is at once jolting and unsettling, opening with a tour-de-force car chase that not only rivals ""The French Connection,"" but sets in place the tone and sense of desperation embodied in the film's other theme: the anguished nature of love."
1,No Man is an Island entire unto himself,"I really enjoyed this book, about a place I will almost certainly never go. It is one of the few in depth meditations on a single place one can find. The other reviewers have said most of what I think needs saying.Two caveats: (1) the archeological material drags the book down eventually. I could have done with about 20 pages less of it. (2) weirdly enough, given that it is a book about a set of isolated islands, and the author's isolation, I eventually wanted to have some more people in the story. That is somewhat unfair as the author does give us a lot of historical figures, but I really wanted to know about the author's wife (we get a picture and a tiny bit about her) and more about the local fisherfolk and all. More conversations, etc."
0,Very interesting...,"I wonder where they found those tiny children to model in the advertisement! Seriously, those kids must only be a foot or two tall. Hmmm...."
0,What a Disappointment!,"I LOVED the series, and waited for this with bated breath: God was this lame! The weakest episode of the series was heads above this. It was really bad and hard to sit through. SIGH!"
1,HIP HOP ABS,"Bought the used video a month ago - it was listed as 'Very Good'. Other than having to push the volume way up to hear it, and a couple of blips (2-3 second stalls) during the playback, it is well worth the $19.99). Don't like the echo in the background (there is another video playing at the same time and it was annoying at first).The content is excellent. Look forward to it every day and have lost 8 pounds in just under four weeks (also follow South Beach diet so that helped). It is challenging (has modified versions) but Shaun T. leads you through it very well. I use P90X but parts of it are a bit much for me at 66 years old.Oh, I'm a guy and it has 4-5 'eye-candy' ladies and you don't have to watch Shaun T. all the time (there are a couple of guys in it, so you don't feel like you are crashing your wife's cardio class).Definitely worth the $20 -- gonna get Part 2 now."
1,Entertaining and Informative,"The book was entertaining and if you are planning to do the Pilgrimage it is informative. I saw the movie ""The Way"" and was curious about the book it was based on. The movie is not a word for word adaptation, but you can see the elements of the book in the story of the movie.As usual the book goes into more depth and more of the feeling the author feels than you would get in the film. The book has a main plot that does not center on a character outside of the author as much as the movie does. But there are characters in both the book and the movie as well as quotations.The book is well done (though a bit wordy) and is a good read even if you have not seen the movie. I enjoyed the book and recommend it, and especially so if you are planning the pilgrimage of Saint James in Spain."
1,Love Keri Shower & Bath Oil,"Though not as popular as it use to be, Keri Shower and Bath Oil is a terrific body oil! Packaging from vendor was lousy but the product is great!!"
1,Worth Buying!,"This CD has awesome songs from the movie! It has four of LeAnn Rimes' new songs including Can't Fight The Moonlight, which is the Coyote Ugly theme song. It's a very upbeat CD worth buying!"
0,don't waste your money,"if you're considering these, my recommendation is to invest your money elsewhere.my belt size is ~31 (32 is too big & 30 is a little small) & i'm a fairly active person with a lot of walking & healthy eater. i bought it after extensive review/research and knowing its limitation. but since i drive a lot, i go ""what the heck""..... yet after 30 days of INTENSE use (max setting at 99, 2-3 hours / day. 4-6 days / week), i have noted minimal improvement in my abdomen musculature. so i don't know if these are as good as the claim. my take is to limit your calorie intake & increase daily physical activity (30+ min /day, until sweating) is much more cost effective than these, especially considering the cost of the replacement pads. when you exercise, you use whole lot more muscle mass, instead of only the ones stimulated by this belt."
1,Great for newlyweds and older-weds!,"Gave this to our new daughter-in-law for Christmas, and she loves it. Our daughter had received this as a wedding gift 5 years ago, and recommended it as a good cookbook -- she still refers to it often. You can never go wrong with Betty Crocker cookbooks!"
0,The read is not worth wait.,"I love the series and the first three books were all excellent. However, in Feast of Crows, Martin's writing is out of control. Rather than offer the cop out that the book grew big enough to be two novels, Feast of Crows should have been edited with the same ruthlessness Martin showed the Starks in the series. This book is encumbered by surplus characters and overburdened by pointless scenes. Paring down the excess would reward faithful readers with a book in the same class as the first three instead half the novel in twice the words."
1,Great Rope,"Great rope. I gave it 4 stars as I have not tried every rope out there, but this one is fast and a joy to use. The longer handles with the foam padding are comfortable. As the instructions go slow when you are cutting the rope down to size. I took a half inch off at a time the first few uses to make sure I did not go to short. I still have a few more inches to get rid of for a perfect fit."
0,Not Happy,"I was under the understanding that this was a concert DVD. This was a christmas gift for my father so you could see how this can be disappointing to me. To me, I would think, ""From the front row live"" would mean a concert. I guess I was wrong. I think that it is a stupid title for just a ""picture"" DVD and I guess that this is the only way that this DVD is going to sell."
0,no self-help book,"However much this book might appeal to you, the schedules in the book are not to be done on one's own, which i found quite frustrating. the book reminds me of 'how to reinvent your life' by Young. Anyway if you want a self-help book, for as much as bpd can be self-managed, i suggest ""the angry heart""."
1,Fine holoiday fun! Two very enthusiastic thumbs up!!,The cursing was good. Mulder and Scully were just like on the show so all the other people who wrote bad reviews of this novel are just jealous because they didn't understand it!!
0,Ridiculous charge for peace of plastic.,"I think it is a crime to gain a wealth by patenting a product that can benefit or correct health condition. Yes, nasal strips do work, but unfortunately I can't get them from honest manufacturer, but crooks."
0,Wait... and look for a better book in the market,Please dont get carried away by the wonderful reviews for this book by some readers. This is an expensive book but definitely not worth the money. The book should be named Java I/O programming rather than a network related title.Most of the book deals with Java streams and the network concepts are very few. At some point the book looks like an API reference than a full fledged text. This info is available in Java Docs for free . The font selected for printing the book is a real turn off. Another disaster from Manning .I will suggest reading Java Network programming title form O'Reilly which is due for release in July 2000 ( do not buy the 1997 edition ).
1,You'll Want To Hear It Two Times In A Row Anyway...,"All agree that listening to the mono and stereo sides are a completely different experience..also, the Nico tracks are fine,as is her entire Chelsea Girl album...the 45's are a great bonus and the booklet with lyrics and overall packaging (slick lamination harking back to those European import albums of long ago) peel-able banana is good and a total anachronistic trip faithful to the original.The anti-elitists Elitists 1st offering.You can't go wrong."
0,Cute but not sturdy,"This product seems like a great idea in theory, but it really doesn't work in real life. The chair is not balanced and it is almost impossible to sit in without having both of your feet firmly planted and you actively balancing yourself. You definitely can't relax in it. We tried even letting a lot of the air out so that it wasn't rolling around so much, and that didn't really work either. Also, once you are out of the chair, you better hope it's not a windy day. There really needs to be some kind of device on it to keep it on the ground and in one place. I did give it 2 stars because the plastic is very durable."
0,Oops here comes another while we wait for Doom3/Halo2,"If you have alot of money to spend and have to play a game now then go for it. I would reccomend Full Spectrum Warrior (same release date.) FPS games are so common now that you should try something new and wait for the REALLY good FPS games that are coming: Doom 3, Halo2, Half-Life 2....yadayadayada. The game is also to short to constitute $50."
1,BUY IT!,THIS IS THE MOVIE THAT ONE AN OSCAR IN SCIFI HISTORY.IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF SPECIAL EFFECTS OF TODAY.
1,"Generally predictable, but very entertaining.","The movie is predictable enough that you can probably guess how it plays out from the cover alone. That said, the acting is solid and the movie is quite entertaining, with some legitimately tense moments."
0,Don't waste your money - even $2,"I have read some positive and some negative on these. I bought four to test on different phones and to test two on one phone.Rather than type a lot of detail, I'll simply say, these did absolutely nothing. If I had one bar before, I had one bar after. Two bars before, two after. Zero? Definitely zero after. This was true on a Dash, RAZR, and Samsung T629. Style, make or model did not matter.Contrary to what I have seen some say, putting two on a phone made no difference."
0,A dim view,This is the least expensive place I've found to buy these bulbs and I still feel it is less than a good value. THe bulbs put out a very yellow light and have a fairly short life span. I'd recommend a led or HID before I'd buy another light that used these
0,Cute but Useless,"Okay, this product defintely has the cute factor going for it. But it is hardly useful as a breakfast jug. Really, if you are more than one person, how far is a 22 ounce vessel going to go? The jug holds 20 ounces comfortably, but 22 ounces is pushing close to the top where you will have spill overs.The jug is too large to use as a coffee creamer. So it just seems like a piece that can't find a home.I think it would be a brilliant vase, and that is what I will probably end up using it for, lest I don't want to totally throw away $30 bucks.Bottom line.... even if you are a diehard Le Creuset collector, for thirty bucks, save your money. This piece is really worthless."
1,Best in the series.,"This book puts such a new light on the bigger picture of ""life"" I couldn't help but be moved. And it makes so much sense it's scary."
0,Good idea but .....,"I purchased two moo mixers. With one of the cups the motor only lasted one use. I called to exchange it. I spoke to Stan the owner of ""Gadgets And Gizmos"" where I purchased them from. He was not nice or helpful at all. I was not happy and only wanted a cup that would last. My children love chocolate milk and when I saw this I thought this would be a great item for them. The owner of the company was rude and did not exchange the item. He sounded like he knew the motor would not last long, but one time is not long at all. I think this product is a waist of money. Hope this helps you."
1,I LOVE THIS MOVIE (AND LIZ)!,This is a stunning and occasionally sexy film that knows how to recreate the look of Ancient Rome. I must thank Fox Video for adding to the TV commercial preview for showing a scene of that gorgeous harem girl dancing without a bra! Wait to you see this and lovely Elizabeth in the actual thing!
0,Could be great?,This program could be great if you could get a hold of someone at technical support to help you. Downloaded the program and none of the stamp images appeared. Have tried unistalling and re-installing at least 7 times. Product manual is not helpful and hardly has any information on installing or trouble shooting.
1,A Beautiful Instrumental Christmas CD,"Tim Janis and his ensemble produce beautiful soft instrumental music--and this cd is no exception. The music's focal point is Tim Janis' piano and keyboards with some soothing strings, flute, and acoustic guitar thrown in for good measure. The song selection is strong with most of the traditional classics nicely covered. This disc is somewhat on the short side (less than 29 mintues long), but does an excellent job putting the listener in the Christmas spirit. A perfect selection for those with multi-disc cd players. Recommended."
0,90 Bucks for this? Really?,"I am amazed at the cost of this set, I own the 3 extended editions for DVD, I wanted to buy the regular edition and blu-ray seemed like the way to go, I almost buyed this set, but It came to my attention that the theatrical release of these movie were sold as singles for 7 bucks a piece in November of this year (on the black friday week)! this set is a rip-off!"
0,It drags,"I tried a couple of times to read this book. Each time I stopped half way through. It dragged in places and was OK in others, but it's definately not up to Mercedes' usual standard. The book finally wound up in the ""donate to the library"" pile."
1,PH Control,I've used it one time and it was very effective. Since purchasing this kit I've read a book on beginning hydroponics--apparently you can use vinegar to lower the PH and baking soda to raise it it you don't want to spend the money on this kit.
0,Less than 1 Star,"I am amazed that the observations the author makes are even worthy the paper they are printed upon. Ther were no starling revelations and the few ideas that were off handedly mentioned and treated as original were merely the smae as those espused by others only more effectively, clearly and earlier than this author. I lament that I even oiffered this author an opportunity to oresent to an audience in Chucago who were basically to hear me speak and the author was a secondary on the program. I am emarrassed for the author."
1,grill cover,Received it timely & it was just like my old one which lasted several years. It fits well & protects the grill........does all I want it to do.
1,Excellent product,My sister's only request for Xmas gift was this grill. Since Xmas she's used it several times and loves it. She hasn't had to battle the cold outside in order to enjoy BBQ. She can now enjoy BBQ indoors and no SMOKE!
0,Don't buy it!,"I have owned my camera for 2 years and had nothing but trouble with it. Once the warranty expired (of course), I had strange problems with the batteries! They would only operate if they were warm! Very odd. And, just as others have posted, the camera suddenly ""died"" on me about a month ago. Not worth the money to fix it, I just purchased a new camera. NOT an Olympus!"
1,great shoe,1/2 size to large but great looking shoe. I got the size 9.0 and it fits perfect. cant wait to see how it looks as it gets older. Think it will look even better.
1,Balls,They get scratched up the first time you use them but I haven't seen any other bocce balls that don't get scratched either.
0,"looked nice, inexpensive but flimsy","The reason I needed keyboard stickers is because I type many keystrokes a day and my letters wear off, and then other get frustrated using my computer.These stickers looked nice in the photos and when I received them. They were easy to apply. They were not expensive at all, but unfortunately they are also a bit flimsy and with someone who types as much as I do, they just started sort of flaking off after a couple of weeks with little plastic threads. I can still type but I'm going to look into something else a little pricier that will be longer lasting.If you don't type a lot, this probably would not be a problem, but then I would wonder why you would need keyboard replacement stickers to begin with"
1,AMAZING!!!!!!,My 12 year old son LOVES this book. He has enjoyed many hours looking through everything. Great price - perfect condition!
1,"Good for art lovers, slightly deficient for a philosopher.","The entries have very good brief historical and religious background. It just failed to show the gradual deterioration of art, in general, and of painting in particular from the time of the Rennaisance to modern times. The entries for modern art were very charitable; the attempt to be sacramental in the descriptions was futile because there was nothing sacramental in most modern art. But the attempt was well-intentioned and acceptable to most reader but it would be disappointing to the theologian.(But the book was not meant for theologians but for artists.) In which case the artist should give it 4 and a half-stars."
1,"Great Tea, Great Price","There's nothing dainty or delicate about this tea. It's is a good replacement for coffee, at least in my opinion. I still drink coffee but with this GPG Tea I can occasionally switch to green tea and still get my morning brew fix. I've tried some of the other brands and was disappointed with the flavor or lack of flavor. It would probably be good on ice, I'll have to try it this summer. BTW...I use a 8 cup french press with three table spoons of tea but two would probably work good for a moderate brew."
1,Ratbag Blows the competition away with New Sprint Car Game,"This new game looks to be one of the best auto racing sims forthe PC around with super graphics and fast paced action like you were actully behind the wheel of a sprint car sliding sideways and if you happen to roll the car your in for a ride and the tracks are all so real such as KNOXVILLE,Iowa where the Amoco Knoxville Sprint Car Nationals are held in August and the game also has the famed Eldora Speedway in Ohio and 20+ other great tracks to try your skills at..."
0,can't even get this installed on my computer,"I bought this printer and found that I can't even get it installed on my computer. Something about the driver? I have a brand new computer, comes with Windows 7 and this is an older printer. Maybe that's the problem. Bought the printer, ink, USB cable, and it is all useless to me.Oh yeah, the installation CD that came in the box said(in English)that English wasn't an available language for installing the software."
0,disappointed,this story just dragged and dragged and I ended up not finishing it. There was little or nothing to hold my interest for any length of time.
1,Pretty good,"This is a pretty good book. It has good explainations and example. All and all, this book is worth it."
1,Love these traps,"I've been using these traps for a couple of years now and have one that has gotten at least 20 mice. Yes, you do need to be careful when setting them but I do it with my ""mouse gloves"" on so I know you don't need to be any type of surgeon to do it effectively. I never use bait but you do need to place them in an area where the mice are actively entering or leaving. They follow scent paths so once you figure out where those are you're in business."
1,Excellent Primer,"Very good book, well written and easy to understand. Covers all aspects of standing up a data center, although at a high level. Each chapter could be the subject of a number of books. This is a good all around primer which will give you enough knowledge to be able to get the most from more in-depth books."
0,OK but not what I was looking for,"This book is not for the intermediate or serious armature painter, but is more for an art major. I have picked up other books and DVD;s that are enjoyable. I.e., Bob Ross ""Grandeur of Summer"" and it was great."
1,a sturdy remote - maybe the old one still works,"Before you buy a new one pop it open and replace the 9volt battery. that's what I just did and it works again. I wish it said there was a replaceable battery inside, I am glad I checked before ordering a new one."
1,A sharp look into an oft-misunderstood corner of the military,"Excellent book for those already in PSYOP who are looking for real-life insight into future deployments. Well-written, easy to understand on personal and professional levels for those who have been in the military, and probably those who are researching from the outside. Very little has been publicly disclosed about this low-profile corner of the military whose existence ultimately centers around one sole principle: to save lives, first of our soldiers and local civilians, then any enemies who they might induce into going our way... see for yourself. A MUST- READ for PSYOP personnel before their first deployment as such."
1,Simply the Best!,"Back in the 60's I said it and I'll say it again...That this group of excellent talent was ahead of their time. Now its the 90's and I would give anything to see a reunion, but Young probably won't do it....I see Neil Young in concert as often as possible and never ever get tired of him...""Yes"" I'm still rockin in the free world :-)A Fan Forever Vivian Guise Irvine, California"
1,B.A.M.,It's beautiful and makes me feel like the B.A.M. that i am. It just runs alittle small so get a size bigger if you want to be B.A. too ;)
1,good for marching band,I needed an extra ligature for my plastic clarinet for marching band season. This is a good ligature for outdoor playing.
1,it's a beauty,"i love this table, it is very well cushioned and fits person of any size. i never used the armrest part and i think that's useless but otherwise, great choice for someone who doesn't need to carry the table around as this table is on the heavy side. most likely one will need a case to store it, the vinyl tears easily."
0,MSI motherboard,"This MSI motherboard was dead-on-arrival and has been returned to seller, still waiting on refund."
1,Really Really INTO THE MUSIC . . . .,"From the start of BRIGHT SIDE OF THE ROAD to the climax of YOU KNOW WHAT THEIR WRITING ABOUT, Its all about LOVE baby love! When he's on his game this man speaks to the heart of life like no other. This is soul music that doesnt just come from a very deep place. He is in the music, like his own language. We who know are lucky enough to listen and be there too. Van is in the ZONE on this entire record, hard to ever find anything this good from anyone. My favorite artist of all time and this is his VERY BEST work! Wait did I just call it work? It cant be work making something this good. This is a JOY like Snoopy dancing on his dog house or being a child and waking up to find a snow day!!!!"
1,Exactly as advertised.,Received my dvd in the condition promised in a very timely manner. Would order from this company again.
0,Painful To Watch,"I'm a horror fan and I thought I'd give Jennifer's body a try. I wasn't expecting much but what I got was far less. This movie is borderline incoherent at times and stupid from start to finish (I must admit I fast forwarded the last half hour). The worst part about it is not how dumb it is, but that it thinks it's so smart. You can tell that the screenwriter actually thought there was some legitimate social commentary going on here. The dialogue in this flick is some of the most idiotic I've ever encountered. It's cringe worthy at times and will insult your intelligence at every turn. Avoid at all costs. Utter crap."
1,Great card,"Used this to ""revive"" and old computer and to leave it with a ""decent"" card. This was cheap and server for the purpose."
1,This book changed my life!,"This book was a gift to me and not having cancer, I wasn't going to read it, but I felt drawn to it and began an eye opening journey. This book taught me a lot about forgiveness and how to pray and the impact we can have on others lives. About halfway through this book, my sister-in-law was shockingly diagnosed with stage 4 matastic melanoma. I am so blessed by having read this book and it has given me the gift of feeling grounded in knowing how to pray and support others during this time."
1,marines,my boyfriend is a fanatic of the us marines since he is veteran and he enjoys every gift i get him with this theme especially this one he wore it on valentine's day!!!
1,cute and fun stroller,"Hi it's me again! I really like this stroller. The design is cute and the girl on the picture looks like she's having fun.(I guess that's what she's supposed to do, smile!) Anyway, I have twin Berenguer dolls..... a boy and a girl. Sarah and Aaron. They will love this! And it looks sturdy too. I'll write another review if I get it."
1,Shoulder and Elbow pain is gone!,"Love the Chuckit! Our dog loves to fetch,and now he gets much more time enjoying this favorite activity, because since we've purchased the launcher, my shoulder and elbow pain have gone away! An added bonus is that I don't have to pick up a slobbery ball! Well worth the money!"
0,You better hope you have a good professor...,"because this book is horrible. The examples are almost always useless, the graphs are few and far between and the problems are often above what is actually discussed in the text. I'm sure when you get to this level of math, the quantity of textbooks available starts to decrease, but there has got to be something better than this book... because it wouldn't be hard to do."
1,An Eclipse Of Hits,"Even though I would have rather Maná to come back with another studio album, they came up with three albums including their greatest hits. ""Sol"" includes the band's ""dancing"" hits, ""Luna"" includes the band's more romantic hits, and ""Eclipse"" includes a combination of both types. This CD includes 13 of the band's past hits and 1 new single ""Te Llevare Al Cielo"". It also includes the video for ""Eres Mi Religion"", which was the second single of their album ""Revolucion De Amor"". One thing that I liked about the booklet in this album is that it gives a backround on some of the songs. This album would have been better if they would have added at least one more song.All in all, this is a very good albums for Maná fans or people who don't have their past albums. I recommend this album."
1,Wonder Woman received,On time.....arrived in perfect condition to introduce another generation of wonder women to this fun show !
1,Pandora,"I thought Pandora was very well written. Though it may not be as long as most loyal Rice readers are use to it is still worthy to be a part of The Vampire Chronicles. The history that was included in the story, was to give you a better feel of the day to day life of the times; or at least that is what I feel. I would suggest that all Rice fans make sure to read this book."
1,Hat with Ear Muffs,I bought this hat for my dad. He wanted one with ear muffs. They are somewhat diffucult to find. He likes this one and I see him wearing it when it is cold. The company shipped the hat very quickly and it arrived before Christmas.
1,An unusual travel mystery that will have you hooked,"This is the first of the Nathan Active series. Set in a small village above the Arctic circle, author Stan Jones draws on his experience as a bush pilot to create characters and situations that could only happen in the Arctic. Jones' characters are complex and intriguing, and his plot line is well executed and compelling. A real treat!"
0,waste of money,My kids play chess so I bought this to improve their skills. My 6 and 8 year olds were just not interested at all. It was a wate of money.
0,Worst thing ever made,"This product was designed by an artist trying to make an attractive looking toothbrush. It is an absolute joke. The outer bristles are raised about two millimeters above the middle ones- meaning that you have to gnash them into your gums just to make contact between the middle bristles and your teeth. Then there's the beveled white part that sticks waaaaaaay out at the top of the brush that is specially engineered to destroy all the gums in the vicinity of the tooth you are trying to brush. It's like having a squirt gun where 30% of the stream goes where you are trying to shoot, and 70% goes straight into your face. There is no way they could sell this with a clear conscience."
1,are you listening ?!?!,this band wow. they blew me away.. if you like the screaming and the singing this is the band for you. they put on a great live show and they have awesome lyrics that almost anyone whos ever been in love can relate to. they arent just another emo band they have more to them and extra something about them. if there is one cd this year to check out it is this one. its amazing.
1,Good for the purpose,"I bought this camera for a small, put-it-in-your-pocket snapper, and it works VERY well for this purpose. This is by no means a high-end camera, but it captures colors vividly, but is a bit loud especially at low ISOs and the images seem (to me) to be a bit more noisy and less sharp than they otherwise could be.It's nice and cheap, and does the job well!"
1,So Far So Good,"I've been using the battery for nearly a month with no problems. It fit easily into the macbook, and has continued to provide about 3 hours of use per charge."
1,Early Cartridges,"This book is probably not going to be of much interest to anyone but the fairly advanced cartridge collector. However for those, it presents some good historical information on a limited group of 19th century cartridge manufacturers (Crittenden & Tibbals, Phoenix, and American) that were located in the South Coventry CT area. In fact it's the only book I am aware of that does. There are also pictures of a lot of the early cartridge boxes. Minor turnoffs are the cheap printing job, all B&W pictures, and a lot of page padding in the form of reprints of a large number of patents. Still, it's good information for those who have a serious interest in old cartridges."
1,Does anybody know....?,"Hi-I haven't actually purchased the soundtrack because there is no track list here... but I was wondering if anybody knew if the soundtrack contained the song that was played during the flashback scene, or even just what it was called. The one I'm looking for was the one that was used when Katie took Epps back in time and showed her what happened to everyone. (by the way... that was the best scene in the film, lol) alright, thanks!"
1,Fits Like A Glove,"I canceled an order on a another leather case when I saw this one. The other case was generic, and made to fit any MP3 player. I would have had to take my Zen Vision out of the case to access the buttons. But I love this case! I thought that the vertical position of the (non-swiveling) belt clip would be annoying, but it was actually a great idea to make it that way. The buttons are closer when I want to change a song while I'm working out, and I can see which ones I'm pressing. The belt clip isn't flimsy either. Great Job Kroo!"
1,Smart purchase.,Definitely agree with others who say their hair and skin feel better after using this shower head. Easy to install and great value.
0,Works when it wants to,"This fax machine is very unreliable. I used it mostly for sending faxes. Sometimes the faxes would go through without a problem. But more often then not, it would give me a ""poor line condition"" error message when trying to send multiple pages. So if I needed to fax mroe than one page, I would have to fax them literally one page at a time. This is frustrating and time consuming b/c then you have to dial for each page. I would not recommend this fax machine."
0,"Old Fashioned, Boring, Waste of Money, Terrible","My 2-year old daughter got ""Mickey Saves Santa"" DVD for her birthday and absolutely loves it. I purchased this DVD thinking it would be similar, but no! Mickey's Around the World in 80 days looks like it was produced 30 years ago - very old fashioned animation and the 'educational' aspect is also very dated. I give this 1 star because my 2-year old would not watch it at all despite it saying it is appropriate for 2-6 year olds. An older child may find it more interesting. It seems to me that Disney is re-hashing old material and packaging it in a new box. Skip this DVD and get ""Mickey Saves Santa"" which is highly appropriate for a preschooler, with up-to-date animation and 3 wonderful interactive stories."
0,Dr. Seuss is rolling over...,"Dr. Seuss left this manuscript in a drawer when he died. He obviously didn't think enough of it himself to publish it, but now that he's dead I guess anything's fair game. The illustrations are designed to fool you into thinking he did them, but he didn't. Yet this book says ""by Dr. Seuss"" on the cover just like The Lorax or Cat in the Hat. Deceitful."
0,Proof That The Radio Is The Black Hole Of Music,"I noticed that almost every band on the radio sounds alike. All rap sounds alike. All diva-pop sounds alike. And all radio rock sounds alike.I decided to download the ""How You Remind Me/Someday"" mp3 onto my computer for the fun of it, and I was laughing. Both songs have the same BPM, the same chord changes, wow, and I thought Creed was terrible enough.The rest of the CD isn't any good either. ""Because Of You"" sounds like something ripped off Metallica's ""St. Anger"", and ""Figured You Out"" has some of the most mundane lyrics ever.Nickelback's new album, ""All The Right Reasons"", hits stores really soon. Expect one of the songs to sound exactly like one of their older songs. Nickelback is a joke and a disgrace to Canadian music. Hopefully they will realize how terrible their songwriting skills are and retire from the music business."
1,Start your journey here,"The best of Castenada's first 3 books, this makes a fine starting point for understanding don Juan's teachings. Perhaps the best of the series for the insights it delivers"
1,"good, but not there best","this album is awesome. but if want something even better, try the first or second album. i still give alot of credit to the guys in Sevendust, but not the best credit"
1,Awesome Show!!!,I loved this show when it aired on USA in the 90's. Nikita kicks butt and looks great while doing it.
1,Comfortable and nicely detailed,"These shoes are very fine for the price. Not the best in the world, but you'll have a hard time beating the quality at this price.Great shoes!"
0,"Not 24""","When I purchased this item it was described as 24"", however when I received it it was actually 27"",not as advertised."
1,Very Interesting -- and it Works!,Wish I would have found this 7-8 years ago when it was first published.I lost 65 pounds but became stuck for a year or more. This book helped me break the plateau...and I'm on the way down again!
1,Fabric Origami,"The ladies in my quilting group went crazy over this book and the new techniques it showed them. It has 24 original three-dimensional flower designs in fabric and silk ribbon. You learn to make a pompom dahlia, a lily, kalanchoe, hollyhock, China aster, an Australian waratah, passion flower, sweet pea, cockscomb, malaleuca, and others. She shows each flower in a finished project with detailed instructions to make the small quilt.There are also patterns for six purses so you can make your own elegant evening bags or give them as gifts.The steps are show in drawings with color so it is easy to see the folding and which side you are working with.The techniques taught are appliqué, Japanese sashiko stitching, beading and embellishment, all-in-one backings and borders, and others."
1,my daughter loved it.,Bought as a Christmas gift for my oldest Daughter. Very good product. I was very pleased and my Daughter was very happy.
0,Where is the magic...,"I read Memoirs of a Geisha like so many reviewers here and wanted to know more about Geihsa. This book feels more like a history book, the narration is dry and choppy no much feeling into it. The story of a little spoiled girl who was able to make her own decision when she was 5 years old. Not my favorite book."
1,not bad,"but you hardly ever really need it. the few times that i thought it would come in handy (small hair that was pushed into skin), it didnt really help."
0,Too many stupid implausibilities...,"This movie wants to be great and could have been great. But it's almost as if two people were arguing when they wrote it: two very different people; a smart one and a not-so-smart one.There are just two many implausibilities unaccounted for.Such as: Why is it established that the infected monsters can eject infected material at a person, but then, later in the movie, you find a non-infected person standing right in front of an infected monster, taunting it, with no protection covering his face???And why, at the beginning, were the infected monkeys only encased in glass if what they were infected with was so drastically deadly???Unexplained stupidities of small detail abound in this movie and destroy it's believability for any thinking, questioning viewer."
0,Disjointed story Line,This story had elements that could have made it a great message. The actors were first rate but the premise of a boy angel was beyond belief. The story line was sometimes slow and plodding and it did not flow smoothly. I could not recommend it as worth buying.
0,WEAK MUSIC!!! NOT EXTREME AT ALL!!,"Limp Bizkit is sterile, play it safe music, and it is completely about cashing in. Limp is a neutered dog of a band, dragging it's a@@ and trying to make a ruckus to draw attention. They are not good at the heavy part of their music, just like they are no good at the rap part. If anyone wants to hear the downright most abrasive album, it would have to be White Light White Heat by the Velvet Underground. Unbelievably raw, it will hurt your ears. Limp fans, just give up. Everybody knows Limp is about as weak as the Backstreet Boys. They are just a little louder."
1,Excellent Suggestions Worked For Me,"I read several chapters of the book and decided to try out some of her techniques for getting someone to fall in love with me. Her suggestions for eye contact and smiling a genuine smile at the girl really seemed to work. Friday night at a bar I tried it on a woman half-way across the room just for fun and this beautiful goddess kept coming back to her table from visiting her other friends to see if I would come over and talk. The following day I tried it again (smile and the eyes) with a female bartender and received too much attention from her --- I really wasn't in for the kill, just experimenting. With all of the other formulas in the book I feel I can get the woman I want (as long as she is ""available"" for love), whenever I want. Read the book even if you already have a mate --- the suggestions are good for keeping him/her once found."
1,Great baskets for the money,"These baskets arrived promptly and are just as advertised. They are built on a square wire frame, sturdy and uniform. I bought six and have them lined up on shelves hiding/organizing clutter - they look nice and do what I wanted them to do."
0,Just get a disney movie,"The series suck. It's only good for kids, but older audience will be pissed to sit and watch the whole thing. Disney movies are better to watch with your kids. I enjoy watching Disney movies even teenager. At least the adults can enjoy the movie too."
0,Okay for a Free Book,"It tried too hard. Really? An unburied dead body showing up in your pregnant cousin's hammock? Could it possibly work the ""I'm so quirky"" angle harder? I think not."
0,A pedantic work to be read with a dictionary or just skip it,"I was terribly disappointed in this book. I thought it would reflect some information useable in the daily application of the advertising or PR trade as I am a consultant. Although it shows ""Advertising, Public Relations...""as part of its subtitle on the cover, very few chapters actually pertain to either. And those that appear are merely historical tracings of people like the author's pet, Bill Bernbach and his agency. The use of hightened vocabulary was not necessary. It was as if the authors were showing off their linguistic prowess rather than reaching their general audience. I should have known better than to buy this book when I read the reviews from MIT, Princeton...need I say more about ""ivory tower"" scholarship."
0,This Man Just Amazes Me!,"So okay, Marilyn Manson. Obviously freaky and corny. Has exploited death and depression and the mounds of suffering teens everywhere for upwards of ten years now. To me, his music sounds like someone banging a garbage can with a very big stick. To you, perhaps this is the most innovative stuff around!The song registers somewhere between confusing and utterly pointless. The lyrics are as follows:mumble mumble mumble (profanity)(profanity)(profanity)(profanity) mumblemumble (profanity) TEENS!mumble mumble TEENS!(profanity)(profanity)(profanity)YEAH! YEAH! YEAH YEAH YEAH!Wow! That was a real mind-trip wasn't it? The only reason I give this two stars is because Marilyn (or whatever it is he goes by) has somehow kept his public depressed and deluded for a record period of time! ..."
1,"Uncut, score one for the fans!","I've only made it through the Pilot and the second episode. I can safely say these episodes seem to stand up nicely over time. 1984 never seemed so cool.The picture quality varies to some extent, but overall is very good and crisp. There are some major artifacts on the master used, but its not too distracting. There are definitely a few spots of dirt that should have been restored.The most important thing is that all the music is here and these episodes are totally uncut. I watched the extra of the music of Miami Vice and the interviews with Jan Hammer are excellent. Overall in the spectrum of what we have seen studios do with television DVD releases, this was very well done.Go get your copy, pop some popcorn turn up the 5.1 sound and enjoy."
1,Does what its supposed to,I used some teflon tape to get it sealed and works fine. Not sure if the teflon tape was necessary.
0,Instant Greek,This book was not worth what I paid for it.... I have a friend who is Greek and he laughed at this book.... He said that this book made Greek look stupid when in reality they don't talk like that....
0,What's this movie about?,"Having heard a lot about this movie, after seeing it, I utterly fail to understand what people like about it. The story: guy has a hell of a row with his wife, leaves her and his nice kids, travels the country with another wife, and finally leaves the mess around him in a spaceship. If this is what happens when aliens come down, well, let them please stay where they belong."
0,Bunk,Cold wars tend to work to the benefit of established elites. China has been changing at light speed; we have not. Our perceptions are still the same as they were in the last cold war.
0,Don't fall victim to the marketing,"So let me start by saying that I originally tried several different HDMI cables when I went HD just to return them and use the cable that came with the DVD player. I've always felt a little bit ""dirty"" using the 50 cent cable that came with the player so after looking into this cable I decided to get one. Short answer: waste of money. I tried this on three different up-converting DVD players and two different televisions (DLP and Plasma) and in each configuration the cable actually made the picture worse. It did brighten the image, but that was never a problem for me. I also did a blind test with some friends, and they all agreed the RazorVision made the image less clear (although brighter). If you're like me and have trouble sleeping at night because you have the stock cables, spend your money on a good therapist, not on this cable."
1,The first work of a great novelist,"Much as one can feel in the less mature works of Joyce, Marquez and even Shakespeare, there is the distinct feeling in this work that the author is destined for greatness. This novel is the sensitive, first-person account of the events during and after the end of World War II. At a time when Germany had been ravaged by war and the effects of its own over-ambition, Boll gives us the story a man, apolitical and barely alive. He shows us how love can blossom in and around the rubble left by the bombings and the shortages of the war. This love of his is strong, yet odd and difficult to imagine. Boll's setting of post-war Germany is seemingly the only context it could have I recommend this work to anyone looking for a novella that is deep in its emotion and broad in its observations of a culture."
1,Most comfortable shoes i've ever had,"I bought my original pair of these shoes in a store, but when they were worn out and i needed another pair, the store didn't have them anymore so i bought a pair from amazon. Over the years, i think i've worn at least 5 pairs of these shoes. Sadly, they seem to be discontinued now and are no longer available in my size in any color.They are the most comfortable shoes i've ever had. It's going to be hard to replace them with something else."
0,Halloween Goes To The Trailer Park,"ThunderTrash 2008!! The Halloween series just gets worse with each film. I thought young Michael was played by a really ugly, young Jodie Foster looking kid. Was that a boy? I'm still not sure. Zombie puts the great Halloween classic movie through a white trash, trailer park dumpster. And why did every reject in this movie have long hair? Was that a requirement to get the role? Even Dr. Loomis had it early on. What a joke. Can you imagine Donald Pleasance looking like a filthy hippie? Very stupid. The only good thing about this unrated film is all the hot chicks. [...] Still, this was a horrible movie. Halloween, Halloween II, Halloween IV, V and even VI (Pleasance last) are classics in my book. All the others made a pure garbage. Don't waste a cent or more importantly your time of such crap!"
1,Awesome flick!,"This is a must own for any sport rider, sportbike or motorsport enthusiast and even seasoned racers. Its excellent soundtrack, innovative camera angles and edge of your seat excitement around every turn will get your adrenaline pumping! The on board footage from all the great Southeast region road courses will prove invaluable for anyone interested in doing track days and also for rookie racers.Oh, and Bubba (reviewer above), This is not a ""stunter type"" flick at all. This portrays people who know how to actually ride a motorcycle... does not contain stuntazzzzz boyeeee!"
1,great record,This has to be one of my most memorable cure albums. It has just enough darkness and poetry yet keeps it listenable. Your not trying to kill yourself because it makes you depressed.
1,Does the job...,"Small, lightweight, inexpensive, sturdy.It does what it's designed to do. Keep it away from the mosh-pit and you won't have any problems. I use it at home and I'm quite satisfied with it.Edit 2/14/12Regarding the review about dumping the bass, I just don't see how that could happen if the stand was/is properly positioned (legs fully splayed) and the bass properly seated. Pushing down on my guitar with far greater force than the weight of a bass, in varying directions, I'm unable to get the stand to tip. Only when the hind leg isn't fully extended does it even become possible and that's only if I purposely lean the guitar forward (more vertical).Just an observation."
0,Garbage,"I am not rating this review low because it should not have been made; which is a different discussion for another time. It is low because how it was written. I can try and explain to someone who has never been to church or seen a church about church, I can present pictures, I can give detailed drawings about HOW it works and how its done. But that person still will not know what its like to be there, to actually experience church. Same is true with this. Yes, is it accurate on how things work, for the most part (albeit the author does talk about ""contemporary"" Sun Dances, which are different than Traditional). Again, without discussing why that is important as that is another topic for another time. The book gives the HOW a dance is done, but it doesn't explain the why or the what. The most important is the why and the what. It gives people a FALSE understanding of Sun Dance."
0,Not impressed,Used 2 bags on spots in small area. Poor results. Very little grass came up. Would naot buy again. Expensive for no result.
0,Wretched Transfer,"The video quality is soooo bad, and my hopes to see good footage of Marcel Marceau on DVD were high. Alas!"
0,"I read it to the end, but I wouldn't recommend it.","I was slightly disappointed when I finished I Know This Much Is True, and as more time passes, the more disappointed I am. I thought the ending too pat (the Native American connection, the ex-wife connection, the girlfriend connection), as if Lamb is attempting to make up for all the horrible anger throughout the rest of the book. In addition, some of the important characters (the social worker, the psychiatrist) were empty. Perhaps I was came with too many preconceived notions--I would have liked to read more from Thomas' perspective."
0,"What? Am I really awake??? Como se dice ""Neurosuppressant""?","Banal - what kind of chronic early-childhood trauma birthed this monstrosity? You need to fire your editor. Oh, that's you. Do it anyway. You paint a nice picture of a disjointed psychology with what appear to be personal narcissisms and idiomorphic obsessions that profilers love to see. Your fixation on dogs over children is especially telling. Do you have much experience digging in crawl spaces???Gee, the hero survives after he leads all his buddies to their meaningless deaths... Prozac, Lithium, et al - post haste. 9x45jlM112"
1,A vastly under-appreciated work,"I have studied this book on and off for a decade. My interest is in philosophy of mind, not in religious issues, but this work is one of the very few that offers a true alternative to the all the untenable and currently accepted views of person-in-world (esp.: material reduction; dualism; functionalism; neutral monism). It lacks a psychogenetic-developmental perspective, and I hope to fill that important and illuminating gap some day in a companioon volume."
0,Safety hazard,"I had this lamp on a timer. I set it on my carpeted floor and left the room to get water for the reptile tank. In the short time I was gone, the lamp turned on and burned a hole not just through my carpeting but through the pad and even charred the floor. This lamp is an accident waiting to happen because the 150 watt bulb extends out almost to the end of the reflector and it has no protective metal cage. Be safe, don't buy it. If you buy it, don't use a timer. In a matter of seconds it can scorch a carpet."
0,auto service manual,"Not as educational as I expected, also not the book that I was expecting we were expecting ""Import Auto Service Manual"" :("
1,Works great,This item was exactly like I wanted. It has enough room for the receiver and dvd player. It looks great on the wall. I highly recommend. Easy to install.
0,"Typical Delillo, self-important without having anything to be really important about","I found this insufferable for the same reason I find most Delillo insufferable, his language is just too incantatory and too bloatedly self-important to really take seriously. He wants to attach profundity and portentousness to everything in sight. Baseball, Nuclear War, J Edgar Hoover, Peter Bruegel, Frank Sinatra... everything becomes a part of this giant, humorously ritualized mythos, which would be fine, but unfortunately fiction needs to have more to it than the atmosphere of a catholic mass in old latin to really function (or at least is does for me). Delillo wants so desperately to be taken seriously, but his vague invocations make it obvious that he doesn't really even know what exactly he wants to be serious about. It seems like he wants to be a prophet of dread, anxiety, paranoia, really of modernity itself. Maybe instead of trying to be an important writer he should just try to be a good fiction writer."
0,Disappointed!,"We are huge fans of Veggie Tales and were excited to see a new one out. My daughter likes the original Little Princess so we thought we would love this.It is sweet, but not at all like the others. It has very little (if any) humor, the silly song (my sons' favorite part of Veggie Tales) was beyond silly to the point of just plain dumb and annoying. Because there is a euphemism replacing God's name in vain which is repeated over and over again in this song, we will not be listening to it again. Shame on you Veggie Tales for putting that in a ""religious"" video.None of my children were impressed at all and even MY little princess said she was disappointed. I did get it on sale, but it still wasn't worth the price. I will definitely be pre-viewing any future Veggie Tales before spending any money on them!"
0,Non-stick Paint comes off the loading rods - Unhealthy & dangerous,"I bought the oven because it claims to provide a healthy alternative. But the reality is that nonstick material / black paint on the ""spit rods"" (gear wheels) comes off with time -- while sticking to the cooked food; This not only makes the food unhealthy but creates health risks. The nonstick coating has shown to be carcinogenic.The spit rods/ gear wheels should have been stainless steel."
1,yummmm,These are simple recipes that are easy to improvise on and inspiring. It makes me long for Italy all of the time. A must have for lovers of Italian food in all the regions of Italy.
1,Good read,It's a very good story and quite different from the movie version. I finished it in a couple of days.
0,One of the worst and most offensive books ever,"An attempt to draw a correlation between individuals suffering from what amounts to borderline personality disorder and ""normal"" human beings who happen to like body art is offensive, ignorant and stupid. If Kim Hewitt did not wish to convey this message she needs to take additional courses in communication and linguistics rather then pursuing a Ph.D. - God help us all! As a working professional in the corporate environment who has numerous tattoos and designs flash art as a hobby I resent the implications of Hewitt's amateur opinion."
1,"Best place for JumpShips, DropShips, and WarShips",This TR is the best place to get designs for your BattleTech campaigns outside of creating your own designs.
0,Look Elsewhere,"If you are looking for a book on the Doolittle Raid, read ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo"" by Ted Lawson. Don't waste your time with this book.The book has many factual and grammatical errors. The names of the Japanese Leaders involved are constantly written backwards. For example, Admiral Isoroku Yamamato is written as Yamamoto Isoroku among many others.The author spends more time on Japan's preparations for the Pearl Harbor attack than he does on America's preparations for the Doolittle Raid. The book is not a page turner."
1,so entertaining!,I found this book to be so entertaining. I love how the author used a second person narrative. It helped you to be more involved in the story. I have to read seven books this semester and this is the first one that I actaually finished before the due date.
1,Good knife.,"I bought this for my daughter because it matches her set. I use a Japanese Santoku because I like it better than the Wusthof or Henkel Pro S. My Japanese Santoku was more expensive and doesn't match my set but it was a gift and I love it,"
1,Penny Serenade DigiComTV,This is without doubt the best quality version of Penny Serenade I have come accross. It is sharp and clear with good sound and good quality resolution. I am pleased to finally get hold of an excellent version from DigiComTV. I highly recommend this.Jacky Day UK
0,'Overboard',"The basic theme of ""Once a Princess"" is good; but the author ruined it with a heavy emphasis on sex. I quickly lost interest and sent it back. If this is the best that Ms. Lindsey can do, maybe she should try doing something else. I am sure there must be a GOOD book inside her if she will just look for it."
0,Boring,Read this book because of all the great reviews. Good world but really need more info as to how the bells etc and how all the creepy people work. Characters are flat and there doesn't ssem to be enough people in the world to flesh out the reality. Wouldn't recommend it and won't read the next one. May not even try to read any other of Nix's books. I am an adult and read a lot of fantasy.
1,Nice,This is my first silver necklace. I have had it on since I purchased it and I have received a lot of complements. It is also comfortable to wear.
1,Best Book out of the Trilogy,"Loved the first book as we followed Sonea's journey through the Magician's Guild training & her relationships w/ Cery, Rothen & the High Lord. I didn't really think there was much in the 2nd book. Although this last book wanders a bit, it wraps things up nicely and offers us a bit of romance as well. (No SPOILERS here) I'm actually reading over certain parts in the beginning as they are hints of things to come! Recommended."
0,Extended Versions of LOTR-Where are they?,"Why didn't they make both versions to satisfy everyone? Answer:MONEY!It makes me sick.......I won't be buying this Blu-Ray set!Don't get me wrong I LOVE these movies,but I have the extended versions of them and it just enhanses the story,and the characters.If you have the ext.versions(box set)save your money they'll get the message."
0,Squirrel Jar Feeder,"I watched as the squirrel ventured cautiously into the jar. The tree to which the jar is affixed is next to the road, and right at that time a man on a golf cart drove by. The frightened squirrel frantically tried to exit the jar, but was facing the way it had entered, away from the opening. I watched it scramble around inside the jar, trying to ""escape"", and thought I might even have to go out and rescue it! The traumatized squirrel finally turned itself around and was able to get out, however, I have never seen a squirrel go completely into the jar since that time. They venture no further than the opening."
1,Nice case!,"This is a really nice case for a small camera. Perfect size for a small camera. Plus,carrying strap is removable allowing the velcro tab to hang on your belt if you wish. This sounds trivial but it's pretty useful actually...Has a small pocket inside to hold batteries or a card.Go ahead get this, you cannot beat it for the price plus it looks nice.Awesome product, highly recommend!"
0,Poor,"The description for the workbook said that there was some writing in it. The book however had all the answers. My sons teacher would not permit him to use the book. So, I had to purchase another."
0,Almost but not for me,"The rating is more of a 2.5 star for me. The shoes fit great and they are true to size, the cushioning is without a doubt COMFORTABLE. However when I first gave these shoes a test run I noticed that my heel felt like it was about slip out of the shoes. I tightened the lacing even more but that cuaused a little discomfort."
0,Horrible sound,"I thought at least the cd sound would be balanced. Nope. Very high on treble, and the remote that comes with it, does not adjust volume...just backwards and forwards for song selection. Looks nice...sounds yucky,"
1,How to make your wife happy!,"I bought this mixer for my wife, it made her so happy she said I would get extra special bonus se oops! Better stop there. Any way she loves it, says it does everything. Better get your wife one if you know what I mean."
0,Waste of Time and Paper,"I read pages 1-118, and was still reading a story about events taking place on THE FIRST DAY the protagonists are reunited.I flipped back to look where day 2 begins, it's not until Chapter 5 on page 140.I threw the book in the trash.The first romance novel I ever read was Shanna, and that compelled me to read The Flame and the Flower and The Wolf and the Dove. I can't believe this was written by the same Kathleen Woodiwiss. What everyone else has said here is true; the book is interminable."
1,Avoid the soy and dip into The Sauce,"A humorous explanation on how to woo the ladies told in the way only an engineering geek turn player can. This one can be appreciated by Good Seeds who wonder why they have no luck with women and Bad Seeds who wonder why they do. Ladies don't miss out on having the inside track on this new play book, don't be sauced!"
0,If there were negative stars I would give them,"Not only did this program prove to be a lame at best excuse for garageband, but it sucked as a program. It was slow and hard to interact and develop songs with. The worst thing about it is that you can't use your own computer audio setup, you have to use their weird USB gizmo that screws up your latency settings causing disgusting noise to blare through your speakers or headphones. This program proved to be a waste of money and a frustrating headache. If you are a garageband enthusiast DO NOT BUY THIS PROGRAM. Suck it up and learn how to use Propellerhead Studio's Reason, its well worth the money!"
0,DOA,Dead on arrival - blade barely opened and then wouldn't shut on the very first time attempt. Very dissapointed and sent it back for a refund.
0,Sub-par effort,"I was very disappointed by this effort, esp. from Magnum, a name I associated with quality photography. Some pictures were ""new"" -i.e., not the usual crop of pictures we've seen. But even allowing for the fact that many photos were taken in the aftermath of the fallen towers, almost all the pictures looked ""muddy,"" grainy and/or dull. Few, if any, of the photos popped out at you with clarity. A real disappointment. Life's commemorative issues (paper and hardcover) did a much better job, though with more predictable photos."
0,Weeks later and still hasn't arrived.,"I would love to review this product, but Amazon first provided me with an incorrect delivery date, then said it was lost but they took the liberty of placing a replacement order for me ""at no charge"" meaning ""no additional charge. Service and shipping have really gone downhill."
1,A bit different from the others,"This book is different and has interesting complexities. There isn't the personal danger as much as in some of her books and I would have liked more of Gabe but the new characters were great, the old ones welcome returns and the ending not at all what you expect. I just hate waiting a year for her next one."
0,Not quite...,"I was so excited about this book, after I read the reviews. The book flows well, but leaves the reader hanging. It really is not a mystery or crime novel, because although, crime does happen, the ending hangs. The bad guy is not caught, there is not closure. I guess this probably reflects real crime situations, but we read these books to get away from 'real crime' and find some measure of justice. You will not find this in this book. I will try the 2nd novel to see if it is any better.I would not recommend this book."
1,It ROcks So Much It Hurts,If you like hot water you'll love fuel for the hate game. it combines their screaming vocals with those poppy melodic guitar parts. It will have you urinating your pants by the time you are done with it.
1,Great Multi purpose pan,"This pan arrived as part of a larger set several years ago. Since I got my hands on it I have used it nearly every day and it remains my favorite do everything pan. I have created everything from a delicate cream sauce that would scorch in a stainless steel or aluminum pan to perfect fluffy rice. Puddings from scratch come out perfect and I wouldn't start my ice cream bases without this pan. It took a few tries to learn that cooking with cast iron requires less heat than stainless steel, but once that was figured out, there was no stopping me. The pan is a perfect size for a single person or a couple. When cooking for many more people I often resort to my three quart pan which I don't like as much. Cleaning this pan requires no more effort than any other pan. The skillet top can also be used for terrific grilled cheese sandwiches although there is only room enough for one at a time. I would give up nearly all of my other pans if I could keep just this one."
0,low quality animation,"the animation for mignola's 'the amazing screw on head' was awesome. not only did the designs look very close to mignola's style, but the timing translated the humor very well.this hellboy animated movie was not made by the same animators. designs are just drawn very poorly, and the timing was awful! the pauses between dialogue felt awkward which ruined the humor of the stories, many of which were directly sourced from the comics.i'm being critical because i'm a huge hellboy fan, a fan of animation, and this one is just not worth watching because of the poor quality."
0,Way too expensive,This is nothing more than a VGA cable with different plugs. It is a rip off. Gold plated connectors or not. Use your compenent connections for near same quality image for one tenth the cost.
1,Nice Portable Version,"This is a great compilation of the entire Watchmen saga. Nice color pages, the colors are bright and vivid, and of course there's the story."
0,not worth it,i bought this product thinking that it was an excellent mp3/fm radio for the price. when i got it i tried it out and the music coming from the fm radio was so full of static that you could not hear anything the product on the whole looks like it might be worth $20.00 but not the price i paid for it

0,Plodding First of a Series,"OK. I liked ""Polaris"" and really enjoyed ""Seeker"", but this one didn't really do much for me. Rather plodding pacing and not much of a resolution at the end."

0,Mainly for diehard Rush fans.,"And I would certainly include myself in that group, but of all of the band's recordings this is the one I would choose last if I was going through every Rush album. This album is to the early era what Test for Echo is to the current state of Rush affairs: neither is very good.Granted, ""Bastille Day"" and ""Lakeside Park"" are both quality songs, but that's about all there is here. ""I Think I'm Going Bald"" seems like a silly novelty song (in other words, not to be on a Rush album) and the two longer songs just seem to drag on forever with few rewards along the way. If you want every Rush album in your collection, and many of us do, then by all means add this one to it. Otherwise, you're not missing a lot if you just go on to 2112 which you absolutely must have."
0,"Bad odor, doesn't fit","When we got the product, it had a strong petroleum odor. That never quite went away, despite airing out on a screened porch. On top of that, no matter how hard we tried, it did not fit the steering wheel of our Toyota Camry. Now it's too late to return to Amazon. Perhaps we just got a lemon, but ""Buyer beware!"""
0,Wrong item,I ordered Vol 1 twice and got the correct box but with the wrong DVD inside. I got Vol 2 both times.
1,muffins don't bother me,"I actually had the matching 2008 desk calendar before I got the book, so I knew in advance that there would be some muffin recipes. The muffin issue doesn't bother me because the recipes are rather interesting. It's not your standard blueberry muffin recipe - there are pumpkin & ginger muffins and raspberry & coffee muffins.I do have to agree that this book is the ""only cupcake compendium that you will ever need!"""
0,Overpriced,"This book doesn't really have much of interest in it. For just a little bit more money you can buy ""American Mensa Guide to Casino Gambling"" which has a lot of good information."

1,Paper Shredder,"So far, so good! I purchased this for our small business office and it sees limited use but it's doing the job well. Replaced another brand that self-destructed in just over a year of mild use!"
0,False advertising,"The cover says in capital letters ""J.D. ROBB BUMP IN THE NIGHT"". This book is a collection of four authors. J.D. Robb's contribution is 1/4th of the book. I didn't think it was very good story. Neither were the other three. -- All four stories had paranormal themes. When I buy J.D. Robb books, I'm looking for a detective story, not a ghost story."
1,Works with Garmin nuvi 660.,"It works and do charge my Garmin nuvi 660. I am very nervous before placed the order, because some reviewers here said it did not work with 660. But I still give it a try, and it works wonderfully!"
1,searching for family tree history,"I Have always found direction for my genealogy searches through the Family Tree magazine. Friends have asked me for help in searching records for black ancesters, tips in searching for Canadian records. The ancestry search done by a TV production for/by Blair Underwood was excellent. A story on the abundance of historical records that could be found in the old black churches in Lynchburg, VA, and a contact name there, would surely be beneficial. Thank you for your excellent magazine."
0,Expected much more,"The idea of racing mico machines in a table, lab, garden or your desk is very cool. It too bad the game did not take advantage of it. Instead, you have a very dull game, with a very annoying multiplayer mode, where you can race for more tah 10 seconds without the race beeing stoped becase the other player dissapeared from the screen and... uh, never mind, just don buy the game."
1,Fun coins!,"I put these in some geocaches and other cachers loved them! They thought they were really a cool idea, and gave everyone a laugh. Plus they are nice so the smaller caches like mine (a magnetic key holder) or other smaller micro caches like film canisters. Really nice coins, and they even have a little weight to them which I like. Thanks for making a great tradable item!!"
0,My cats weren't interested in this at all.,"The gun is not very practical. The liquid easily leaks out and the gun is so loud it scares, rather than entices, the cats. Also, it doesn't make very many bubbles before it runs out of liquid, because the chamber is too small. Also, the liquid does not smell like catnip at all - it is virtually scent free. My cats had absolutely no interest in this toy at all, and they are both very friendly, playful cats. Unfortunately, this was a good idea but it didn't work very well in practice."
1,Black Hawk Down in Baghdhad,"It's fitting that the author of Black Hawk Down wrote the foreward to this book, as it reads with the pulse-pounding excitement of Bowden's classic book of urban warfare. Think of this book as Black Hawk Down with tanks. Excellent examination of the flexibility of armor in an urban environment, and although it won't give you the broad view of a more comprehensive work like ""COBRA II"" it is an excellent detailed examination of the strikes that led to the fall of Baghdad."
1,A well-written fantasy novel!,"One of the strongpoints of this series has been the unpredictability of the books - in this novel, the shift of focus changes quite suddenly from Alias to the young nobleman. I won't comment on particular plot points so as not to ruin it, but the surprises are what kept me turning the pages. Novak's writing skill is sufficient to draw me in to the Forgotten Realms, making the characters real and the locations almost palpable."
1,O N L Y.......F O R.......K I D S .....????,"GNARLY TEETH FAKE DENTURES AS SEEN ON THE TV SHOW OUTSOURCED, seem a lot of fun! I've never seen the TV show, but I CAN see that these fake dentures have a LOT of uses!For instance, the teeth shown on the model, (and he is NOT a child!), could be the latest in vampire-fashions! I mean -- why have only two fangs when you can suck blood so much FASTER with so many MORE fangs?The ""smiley"" teet, (on the right, second to last row), should be GREATwhen asking for trhat raise -- or for children, asking for that raise in one's allowance!)Each set of these false dentures has a good use -- with five, it's fun to decide which to where on what ocasions! A whole WARDROBE of false Gnarly teeth -- for men AND women, (and boys AND girls), it could be rhe new, latest thing in fasion! Hopefully it will be made in BOTHadult AND children's sizes! : [ : ]E"
0,It's an infommercial,"I have read many books and watched more documentaries on this topic than I can count. By far, this film (if u wanna call it that) is nothing more than a commercial to get the viewer interested in buying dvd's from reality media (or is it reality entertainment??). I have NEVER posted a comment online about anything....until now! My aim is to warn people this film is horrible!"
0,Where are the Exericise Solutions?,"This book explains things fairly well. I would have rated it a 3 or 4, but they forgot the most important thing: THE SOLUTIONS TO THE PRACTICE PROBLEMS!!!!! Where are they??? Without the solutions to the practice problems a technical textbook is pretty much useless!"
1,SO much fun!,"My friends and I are having SO MUCH FUN with this toy! It works great, but it takes longer than 20 seconds to dry. In the summer it's going to be even better!!"
0,what a waste,I agree with tmygun. Don't waste your time. This is just plain terrible. And the blu ray just highlights to poor quality. Not worth the $2 rental.
1,Great book,This book kept me on the edge of my seat. An awesome read can't wait for more to come out in this series. Will keep reading them great book.
0,Ultra-soft and ultra-cheap,"These are only worth $15 on a good day. These are not what I thought them to be when I ordered them.First, these are like 100ct? Maybe? The package doesn't say, but I think if it doesn't say it's assumed 180ct. If you hold up a piece of single ply toilet paper, that's what there sheets look like. They're thin. This means that over time, maybe the course of 6 months to a year of washing and sleeping, they're going to look and feel like screens. They're soft, they're just not durable, and won't be soft for very long. Not to mention, my cat with his claws will have runs in these in no time.I'm a fan of high count sheets (450 - 500+) so these are a considerable step down. Amazon has great deals on nice sheets, so I recommend waiting for those than buying these. Those deals aren't much more than these sheets were (I think I got 1000ct for $39). I got suckered in by the price too, but really...they aren't worth it."
1,Awesome except they missed my favorite B side!,"This CD contains the songs that made this era of Def Leppard truely great. The only thing that I would have liked included would have be the electric version of ""Miss you In A Heartbeat."" It was a B side on one of the singles (off the top of my head I am forget which one). I suspect that it was not included because Miss You In A Heartbeat was a song on Retroactive but it was the accoustic version. Unfortuately, this was my favorite B side and it is not on this CD. Other than that, this collection is awesome. I now have a lot of extended versions of songs that I only ever saw/heard on MTV or live in concert. I wish the band would go back to making songs like this. Enjoy the memories."
0,"Warning: Sound not great, highly compressed.","Lots of other great reviews on the content and song selection. But if you are a fan of great sound and concert videos, think twice before purchasing or consider a rental. The audio is highly highly compressed and just doesn't sound that great. I give the show 4 stars and the audio, 0 stars. Will make your super duper home theater sound like TV speakers."
0,Not currently compatible with Mac OS X v. 10.4.8 and later,"Adapter does not work with my MacBook running OS X version 10.4.10 due to driver incompatibility.StarTech technical support advises ""kernel change"" beginning with OS X version 10.4.8, probably is causing incompatibility and they're working on patch as of 24 Jul 07.Full marks to the responsive, knowledgeable tech support team but this product's not targeted to Mac users in other ways: 1) inaccurate installation instructions; 2) software provided on mini-CD not playable on MacBook (requires CD player that ejects a drawer/cupholder); 3) necessary installation files hidden in nested folders with cryptic titles.So Mac users, before you order this USB to Ethernet adapter, recommend you check with StarTech on current driver compatibility with your OS version and be tech-savvy enough not to need the manual."
0,A betrayal,"I have to confess that I enjoyed the first book in this series, however I considered the second book such a betrayl to the ideas incorporated in the original that I refused to finish this series, the first time this has ever happened for me. I'm sure the story by itself isn't bad but to have one character fail to find happiness due to the gods and then let his sister get away with it seemed so unfair and pointless that I would like to warn people away from this series."
0,Down Hill,"The story is just to far fetched.Too sci-fi,it went from being a kind of middle aged based game to becoming sci-fi with graphics worst than the first.The portraits are worse,the icons you can barley even tell what it is.Just a lack of animation all together.Its one big dissappointment."
1,LOVED it,"If I had to choose only one DVD to keep from my vast collection, this would be it. Watched it and loved it numerous times, and will continue to watch it again and again. This is that rare instance when a movie is actually better than a book. Highly recommended."
1,Goes beyond public opinion and into social constructs,"I read the book for the first time as a student of public opinion in Singapore where the issue, because of government policies, is very restricted and controlled.The book gives the reader the possibility to comprehend public opinion from a wide range of topics (form political to historical, sociological and even psychological). It provides with plenty of examples, theories and studies done by the leading experts of leading universities where public opinion is studied, and, at the same time it explains the four W of such theories. It carries the reader from the meaning of public opinion to the impact of it in the construction of society, policies, social norms, religions, etc. It is concrete, profound and easy to read, as well as amazingly interesting."
1,legend of the lone ranger,Have been searching for another Lone Ranger to add to my collection of the the masked rider. Have numerous DVD's of the TV series and also only 2 movies made by Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels! Am feverishly awaiting the new movie coming out next year!!!!
0,IT's not easy to pass CCDA exam with this study guide!,"I just passed the CCDA exam today. However, I found that this study guide is not enough to pass the exam. The case studies in this book are only for high school students, not for cisco professionals who want to know more netwok design...hard to pass the CCDA exam with this book!"
1,Spawn Series 1 Action Figure,"Love Todd McFarlane's Spawn, and this is a very cool action figure. The one I got was a rare ""Hamburger Head"" variant as well, so I was pleased with that. As always, Todd McFarlane does top-notch work on his figures."

1,contact paper rules,"What's not to like? I can have instant blackboards, any size, wherever I want them. It's an awesome product, but was shipped in a huge box, with air pillows, when a simple mailing tube would have worked. Wasteful packaging."
0,THE MOST BORING GAME EVER MADE!,This game gets really boring really fast. I mean there's only like 13 levels that aren't that fun and the overall gameplay is just plain stupid and too hard!!!!!!!!!
1,"For the price, a fun and useful lens","I use this lens on the end of standard zoom and wide-angle lenses on my Rebel XSi and AE-1 (it came with 58mm and 55mm adapter rings), and for its price I don't see how it can be beat. With a Super Wide you know you're going to get barrel distortion, so I like to put it at its widest and get real close to a subject, even focusing on things just an inch or two from the lens.One thing of note is that is doesn't go well stacked on a telephoto lens, but that's not unexpected considering the contrasting purposes of each. I'm not taking a star off a product because it doesn't do what it's not designed to do.There are a lot of creative things you can do with this lens, and for such a small price compared to high-end fish-eye lenses, I'm definitely glad to have it in my bag."
1,Zevonola,"The CD Stand in the Fire by Warren Zevon heralds back to a time of my youth of thirty years ago. It is an in concert product showcasing his unabridged version of Send Lawyers,Guns,and Money which is why I bought it. Also on the CD is his Werewolves of London to be played at Halloween as a rite of passage. He was an icon of Classic Rock and Roll and underappreciated. The price I paid was more than I normally agreed to pay for any one CD. It would have rated five stars if it weren't for the money it cost me."
1,What color is your Parachute,A really good book to help you figure out what it is that you want to do or be as an adult if you need a little help.
1,"Woah, who is this guy?","Just browsing, picked up this CD, and man, it's crazy! Looks like it's the first and only album, but definitely a collector's item for underground fans."
0,disappointed,This book was not what I expected it to be. I was looking for a resource to offer instant activities. This was not it.
0,Unengaging.,"I have struggled hard trying to figure what this movie is trying to be. It wasn't suspenseful, nor all that entertaining, nor did it feed the violence hungry viewers among us.Our main character, the radical high school prude, is not a hero, nor an anti hero. I don't particularly like her nor do I dislike her. The acting overall reminds me a bit of high school plays, especially the brother.There is not much gore and the tid bits of violence we do get are not all that wild, despite the ""toothful"" situation. Even though the premise could call for some exotically erotic scenes you'll be disappointed here as well.The cinematography and editing are by the books and I was once again reminded that too many directors don't take advantage of the variety ""film language"" can offer to create stunning visuals that tell a story or just simply entertain us viewers. The director relied too much on the shock effect of the girl's ""talent"" however failed to actually be shocking."
0,The only thing scary is how bad it is.,"I read a description of this movie somewhere that implied the young boy was the one haunting the property. That was not true. Instead, the boy leaves his body and gets lost in The Futher. That is cool, until we find out that he is being held hostage by Darth Maul who has a fetish for the song 'Tip Toe Through The Tulips' by that weird 1960s singer Tiny Tim. Leaving us as an audience thinking, nevermind..."
0,Hope it's better than the Brother model I bought on this site,"I purchased a Brother sewing and embroidery machine on this site in 2005. I believe that model, PE-400D, has been discontinued. And no wonder -- what a piece of junk! In the first six months of use, I had to take it in for a $169 dollar repair when the touch screen stopped working reliably. Recently (April 2007) it began exhibiting the same problem.I paid $399 for this machine, which was a huge discount over the prices I saw elsewhere for similar machines. But one more trip to the sewing machine shop and I'll almost have purchased the thing all over again, with no guarantee that this repair will permanently solve this problem. (Or whatever other problems start cropping up.)I'm going to donate this machine to some worthy cause, warning them that they'll probably never be able to do anything but straight stitching. I'll also make a solemn promise never to buy another Brother product, ever again."
1,Just as advertised,10' monitor cable came just as expected and in a fairly short time. Now I can hook up the netbook to the TV in the living room while still sitting on the couch. Whee! :-)
1,Satellite!!,"I think or better yet I know P.O.D.'s new album is awesome. Wuv, Sunny, Marcos, and Traa have really outdone themselves this time. P.O.D is a great band sending out a great message. The songs on ""satellite"" are Christian based and are very inspirational. After all of the negativity we have to deal with daily in this world it is good to have some positive music to listen to."
0,"Repeating, repeating, repeating...","You will not learn C++ with this book, you will learn what buttons to press in Visual C++ to make different things show up. Nothing wrong with that, becaues the title says it's Visual C++ it's about.However, instead of showing what buttons to press in the ClassWizard once, the same 5-pages guide is everywhere, with EVERY example! Sources codes are repeated over and over again in the book. And even text about certain functions/features are repeated (not just part of it) whenever something similar is used in another example.This book could easily become 1/4 of it's current size if the author didn't pressed copy/paste so many times. It seems that the main goal of the book is to be as large as possible (as many pages as possible). Maybe that's what authors get paid for?"
1,MUST HAVE FOR BABY'S BOTTOM,"My 5 month old was born in February, and although its nice to have in the summer it's definitely a must in the winter to have warm wipes on your new baby. I even use it on my toddler (20 months when my new baby was born) and you can tell they were more comfortable to him warm. It doesn't dry the wipes, and you can fit two packs of wipes at a time almost. The night light is really nifty to so you can see without turning on the bright light in the room."
1,DOWNTEMPO BANDITS WITH SLAMMING RHYMES,Madder Rose mainman delivers a slice of Bristol with a sideorder of New York City beats and lyrics. Billy Cote(Madder Rose mainman) teams up with other Rose(Mary Lorson) and New York City performance artist Don Greene to bring us a downtempo trip-hoppy journey that Mazzive Attack or Tricky would be proud of. Where Mary handles the vox on the Cd's single (where you are star)Don Greene spins drunken yarns that the most urbane would find scary! This album will finally show the true talents of Mr. Cote as a talented songwriter and producer. BUY THIS! You will not be disappointed.
1,"Fun, but not Barnaby","Contrary to Amazon's sub tittle, this is NOT an Inspector Barnaby mystery. Just a fun, lighthearted read for English mystery lovers."
1,"Product just fine, but no instructions.","The product is just fine. Imagine buying a basic Hoyle deck from the store, the quality is just the same in my opinion. So no complaints there.However, I did not receive my instructions. Not really a big deal since you can just use google if you need anything.The product description says""You will receive the deck and the instructionsRed or BlueVideo instruction link included""I did however get this ""Video instruction link"", unless I suppose, if they were refering to the fortune inside a fortune cookie sized piece of paper included with a link to a website.Anyways, over all the quality, shipping, what I expected were all great."
0,Rabbit Proof Fence movie review,"If this review were an 'American Idol' rating, Randy Jackson would say, ""Weeeeell, it was just alright for me dogg."" and Paula would say, ""It revealed an important era in world history, and I thought the acting was pretty good."" and Simon would say ""What an excruciating waste of my time."" . . . and I'd be in Simon's corner."
1,Great!,Just the right size. Engraving is clear and legible. Purchased this for my mother for her birthday (she's quite the green thumb) and she loves it! I definitely recommend this item!
1,Full of twists and suprises!,"This is the first book that I have read from this author, and it won't be the last. I was looking for a quick one setting read and picked it up at the library. I was suprised to find that this has become one of my favorite books. A book about true friendship and the ways in which people can be best friends yet be so different. We see the views of all four characters in the book and feel as if we know them. A book that was full of laughs and tears with an unexpected mystery toward the end. I suggest this book to anyone who wants a good summer read about women and friendships."
0,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed in Judith Gould's latest book. In a nutshell vet engaged to marry cocaine sniffing embezzler who is better suited for her domineering mother. Vet meets owner of large estate who had been horribly disfigured in a polo accident and has mutiple emotional problems but alas after being with the vet twice he overcomes all of his problems! There are a few other characters not worth mentioning. I found the characters quite shallow, consequently the book lacked depth. It certainly is not up to Ms. Gould's usual high standards. I almost felt as though the book was written in a big hurry to please the publisher - not the readers."
1,Classical Program.,"This is a dvd for lovers of classical music. It contains selections by: Corelli, Praetorius, Bach, and Handel. There are only three well known Christmas carols presented. The performance is excellent. The production values are not great, but are acceptable. If you want a Christmas dvd of classical selections, then this is for you. If you want standard Christmas carols and songs, then seek elsewhere.Four stars for an excellent performance."
0,A high end look with way too much high end.,"From a distance these things have the look of well crafted head phones.Up close it's easy to see that they are cheaply made.Bottom line: Way too much high end. Its distracting and sometimes painfull. I've heard sounds more true to reference from headphones that are a third the price. Save up a little more cash, do some research, and get the real deal."
0,Return,I returned this product. There should be a listing of tracks so people do not purchase the wrong thing. Very misleading. I thought Hidden Beach included artist Like Jill Scott. Not what I got on this CD. I will never buy another CD from Amazon that is a compilation unless the traks and artist are spelled out.
1,ENJOYABLE READING,"Although the book at first seems full of new informaton and new pictures it fails to meet the description of the title. As a big fan of PINK FLOYD however I found it to be an enjoyable and interesting new way to look at the works of ""THE GREATEST BAND IN THE UNIVERSE:PAST,PRESENT AND FUTURE""and therefore I would recommend this book to any hardcore FLOYD fan who already knows the stories and will not be misinformed in certain areas. One minor flaw is that it claims to include every song, but it doesn't,(there are a couple missing)probably because these were not officialy released on record. Other than that it is a good read while you listen to PINK FLOYD on vinyl."
0,The WORST charmed boook!!!!!!,I have read every charmed book to date and this was by far the worst book of them all. none of them used their magic it was a very basic book. cameron Dokey should be ashamed of this bookVERY DISAPOINTING
0,Totally unbiblical,"It seems like Mr. Weise bought into pop culture portrayals of hell when fabricating his ""experience"". The hell he describes in his book is not the same hell that is described in the Bible. I also question why God would choose him to see hell in order to witness to the world, which undermines the absolute authority of the Bible as the final revelation. Either he had some sort of lucid dream or he is lying. Good intentions aside, I do not recommned this book."
0,Not Up To The Hype,"I purchased this vacuum about a year and a half ago and curse it everytime I take it out of the closet. Yes, it has great suction for dog hair and dust but don't try anything much larger. You might as well pick it up by hand. But that isn't the problem here. This unit in addition to a questionable design has one of the CHEAPEST power cables you could put on a vacuum. At almost six hundred dollars for this unit I am appalled. The plastic I can deal with but not putting on a high quality power cable is just wrong. Dyson should be ashamed of themselves. On top of that forget using the attachements. It is just dumb. Obviously designed by someone who thought they were clever but doesn't live in the real world. Forget cute and make it work. For $250 this would be an ok machine but at $599 it just isn't worth it."
1,One of our faves!,"Social commentary for children, that parents will enjoy, too! Like most Dr. Seuss books, this one also has vibrant illustrations and great rhyming... So fun!"
1,Big Square Happy,"From time to time I have always needed a longer square, for floors, adding a deck and other projects. This is a nice tool for all of that and more."
1,A great reference for the CPU and ASM,"I've been programming in high-level languages for a number of years and this book took the little bits of knowledge I had of hardware and other obscurities and put them all together. Not only is it a great reference for ASM, but a gives an unparallelled understanding of the CPU. The only problem I had as a novice Assembly programmer was the few code mistakes and Irvine assumed that the reader knew a little too much in the first couple of chapters."
1,Great Backpack,"I'm in college and so I often have to carry many heavy books at a time. This backpack works wonders, its strong and sturdy and is big enough to hold all the books i need. The strap never slips off like other backpacks. Not to mention all the compliments i get on how pretty it is."

1,Address Book,This is the coolest address book that I have ever owned. It has nice quotes thoughout the book and lots of space for entries. I would highly recommend this address book.
0,Uncomfortable Design,We bought it for my wife who is in her second trimester. And she has to sleep on her sides but with the design of this pillow it was very difficult for her to change sides.
0,Poorly made and little fun,"This toy was poorly made, didn't hold together well in the tub and it was almost impossible to may the musical notes. The seller was not very helpful about return/refund. I won't buy from Amazon ""partner"" sellers in the future - more like a flea market than a retailer."

Like, what has this world come to? people are constantly mistaking garbage like this for music? My oh my, what a bunch of little poor misguided souls. From start to finish this CD is bound to sound like crap if Britney's singing, which of course she is! who told her she could sing? well whoever did, or whoever told her she had what it took to be a singer, apparently they were wrong! maybe she thought if she just showed a lot of skin she'd be really famous and to hell with how she sounds. Ughh, wrong again honey! For the love of God, please don't waste your money on this! I'm sure glad I didn't."
0,"It works, after modification.","This is a very inexpensive charger. It claims to be for MP3 players but it would not work with the Sylvania SMP4029 MP3 Player, until I modified the internal circuit. I removed the label to expose the two screws that hold the case together. Pin 1 is +5 volts and pin 4 is ground. I cut pin 2, leaving it open. Then I soldered a short wire from pin 3 to pin 4. I put it back together and now it works with the Sylvania."
0,DANGER! Not real Pyrex! Exploding Junk!,"This is NOT real Pyrex! It is NOT high-temp glass! It explodes in medium-temp heat! Lucky our 3-year old was not in the kitchen when ours blew up, shattered--it sent glass pieces all over the kitchen. JUNK!!! Should get ZERO stars."
1,One of her best books,I think this is one of her best books. Definately not for a beginner though. If you know your way around the kitchen the recipes are fun to make and delicious to eat
1,Great Music - Great CD,This is a great collections of songs with Rod Stewart covering with renditions worthy of the sound of the original hits.
0,They ruined it,"I went to my local bookstore and saw they were re-releasing Sweet Valley High and I was excited because now I could finish my collection, I had no idea they were rewritten and when I was reading one of the books in the store I was shocked to realize this. I almost flipped out.I can see the whole email thing and cell phones but changing story lines and characters and other stuff wasn't necessary they pretty much rewrote the second book. This is very upsetting.They didn't need to change their sizes from a 6 to a 4. Teenage girls already have issues about that and now they are trying to say a size 6 is too fat? Since when?"
1,Not an Edwin McCain fan,"Im not at all a huge fan of his, but i'd recommend this CD to anyone strictly for the song ""Promise of You"" which is absolutely electric."
1,American Horror Story Show,"From what I can tell from the first episode, this series has taken cues from many of the earlier horror stories during the late seventies, early eighties. It is very well made and the all-star cast does a marvelous job. I plan on adding this to my DVR....."
1,Blue and friends put on a show - and you help!!,"This is one of the better companion books to this popular kids television show, and complements the Blue's Big Musical movie. Pictures are drawn in a coloring book format and many stickers are included, as well as cut-out characters and a cut-out stage. There is a lot to do here, with some help needed for cutting, and the story of Steve and Blue and all the usual characters getting their show ready is not only entertaining and instructive for kids, but is a great setup for children's continuing play using their own ideas for the actual (or their own) show. Nicely done."
1,1408 HAS IT ALL!!!!,1408 HAS THE TWIST AND TURNS THAT KEEPS ONE WONDERING AND THAT EDGE OF YOUR SEAT TERROR THAT WILL MAKE YOU TURN ON EVERY LIGHT IN YOUR HOUSE.... IT WILL KEEP YOU GUESSING UNTIL THE VERY END BUT WHEN THE END COMES YOU WILL BE SORRY THAT IT'S OVER THIS MOVIE DEFINETLY HAS IT ALL!!!!
0,Dry Stamps,"I should have read the reviews. The ink is dry and the pencils barely show. Saev your money, Do not purchase this product as is. Purchase the stamps and ink pad separately."
1,Have a blast with Maggie at Enchantments,"Alt's cozy mystery really spoke to my own beliefs and interests, and she had me giggling or pursing my lips in all the right places. The Trouble with Magic is a bit clumsy at times, but it's nothing that you wouldn't find in any first-in-a-series book. I loved the characters, found the narrative to be well-paced, and had a grand old time. I'll certainly be looking for the rest of the series!"
0,Wishful Thinking,"This movie made me want to invent a time machine, travel back in time, and prevent myself from seeing this movie."
1,"Good, quick read","All-American Girl is a good book, if far-fetched. The plot is good, though it is a little predictible.But if you're looking for an enjoyable book or a quick, amusing read, this is it.If you're looking for a romance, try Cabot's Avon True Romance for Teens books. Or if you want something a little more, try the Mediator series."
1,Glossy America,"This film is good enough to inject some visuals regarding our history, but it is not a stand alone film. As a teacher, you need to provide lots of background information prior to showing this film. But it has great visuals!"
0,Full moon in one night?,Mickey and his pals have to get to a party before the moon turns from a crescent to a full moon. It takes place in one night! How is this scientifically possible? (The moon doesn't change from a crescent to a full moon in one night.)
0,Beware,"I purchased this tv/vcr combo for my teenage daughter, and we really liked it at first. The size, good quality tv picture, and the FM radio were all nice features. However, after only about 6 weeks of use, the vcr started to mangle tapes. Several of our tapes were ruined, and would no longer play. Maybe this was a fluke, but I would not buy another one of this brand of tv/vcr."
1,This is the best book I ever read! Excellent!,"I cound not put this book down! I was amazed of the imact black slavery has on us today.The entire truth was never taught to me in school. I'm glad this book tells it how it is(or how it use to be)!This book taught me how to heal deep emotional scars that have been pasted down from one generation to the next. I had no idea what a profound impact past emotional abuse has had on my personal life and love relationships today. Don't live in the dark, buy this book and be enlightened to the abudance that was ment for you..."
1,House- Season 2,"Basically, my opinion is the same as that of Season one....OUTSTANDING!! It just keeps getting better and better. This show is completely addicting. Hugh Laurie is wonderful, rough and sexy as can be! He is so down to earth, so very rough around the edges, but you can easily see he is very vulnerable underneath the rough exterior. This is one of the many reasons his character is so very interesting and appealing. It makes you want to keep watching to find out what it is ""exactly"" that has made him what he is. The other characters also mesh well together, they did a great job choosing the supporting actors. What else can I say? GREAT SHOW!"
0,One star is better than NONE!,"I actually purchased this video. Why I think the artwork on the box is awesome. that's about it. I like the whole mad scientist concept and some dialogue was ok. Other than that it deserves what it gets BAD reviews. For 13.99 it's not that much of a rip off. At least you can take it to the ""John"" and look at the art cover. hehe Than again if you get a kick out of ""so bad it's good"" you might sit through it ""I DID"" hehe"
1,very nice,"This product looked about the same as the picture. Usually amber has some kind of air bubble or dark inclusion, but the one I received was more or less clear. The setting is very pretty and sets off the stone well. The chain is a bit flimsy, but for the price, it's completely adequate."
0,comming apart at the seams,"Seams already have started to come apart. Have only being worn three times,,!Very poor workmanship. Expected better.Do not know where to return product."
1,new favorite sneakers,"I love the Onitsuka Tiger Mexico 66 sneakers and have several pairs in different colors. They don't have much arch support, but they are very comfortable. I like that they feel like part of your foot instead of a bulky appendage like the running shoes I used to wear casually. Plus, I love the retro styling."
0,FRENCH FLUFF,"""American Vertigo"" has all the depth of a creme brulee - once you break through the thin topping of burnt sugar, you sink into custard. M. Levy is one of those egocentric ""poseurs"" whom only the French could adulate. Some of his perceptions of America are interesting, but for the most part he puts everything in terms of himself and his choice of subjects leaves us with an ""Amerique Insolite"" - a bizarre America that does not reflect this country's realities. Next time, M. Levy, take a tour of France."
0,capable of more,"Music is such a subjective transient experience! With that being noted, I am always hesitant to take the time to write a review or comment about a recording ( actually this is a first). This disc starts out with a fairly well crafted moderate-yet mellow, poetic tune that had me initially believing this was going to be a great disc. Unfortunately there are only glimpses of what I like to hear-this recording lost my attention. Mellow, laid back and reflective is fine (ie iron and wine -old elliot smith, nick drake)... Im still searching for something more."
0,just waiting for the third pair to break as well...,"Yes they break and they're to tight they definitely wont come off, when running or shaking your head violently.They must be made for pygmae-heads, my heads is 56cm around, which is normal adult size and they are too small.I had them exchanged twice as they broke within 2-3months of purchase/replacement and I am now waiting for the third pair to break, then I have to have them replaced again.The sound is quite good and the wireless freedom is brilliant, which is why they receive two stars from me, but the breaking and tightness is annoying.Until Logitech improves the design - DO NOT BUY THEM!!!(I have contacted logitech to inform them about the problem, please do the same, maybe some day they will listen)"
0,DRM Lame,Don't support DRM that hurts the consumer. Avoid at all costs and spend hard earned money on companies that don't treat their customers like thieves.
0,sad...,"This flick made me angry and sad but also made my eyes pop at the same time. First off, the film scratches the surface of what the comic book of Spawn is all about. A thin plotline and even thinner characters almost ruined it. But then again the visuals remain among the best I've ever seen. To make a long review short, this is a classic case of style over substance."
1,Used delight,"Hreat condition, as advertised, great service! Book in great condition in the original jacket, couldn't have been better unless I got an original issue."
0,Don't Bother!,A complete waste of time and money. I have several refill sprays if anybody wants them.
1,Quite Beautiful,"After much research as well as a visit to Best Buy, I purchased this monitor and have not regretted it for a moment. The size of the screen (especially when in highest reso mode) and the stunning detail and instant response is quite simply, beautiful. In fact that is the feedback I get from everyone who sees it. I use the DVI input, and greatly appreciate the color and depth to videos and pictures. Strongly recommend."
1,ABSOLUTELY THE FUNNIEST MOVIE EVER!,"This movie is only dumped on by losers who don't like the show. If you don't like the show, don't go see the movie. The opening of the movie was the hardest I have ever laughed in my life, even crying the laughter was so hard. The movie was never slow, the laughs never stopped and the money was so worth it. If you like the show, see this movie. If you don't like the show, shut your mouth and go see some Disney movie."
0,Great Holiday Songs,Another Great CD by the Talented singing sisters Ali and AJ. they have Great voices and i look forward to more cds from them in the future.
0,Bad clams!,"Adequate for office use. DO NOT buy one to scan film.Mine works OK to scan prints up to 8x12 or documents. The film/slide scanning attachments or software did not work from the first time I tried it. Unfortunately I found this out a few days out of warranty. It's absolutely useless.DO NOT buy one to scan 11x17 because, unlike our friend ""Joe"" says, the glass is only 8.8"" x 14"" Use a ruler much, Joe?I'm running XP pro 800mhz w/2 gig ram."
0,Not worth the $$$,"The idea of an ice cream maker with a compressor was just what I was looking for, but this is NOT it! The compressor part is great-it is the motor that turns the paddle/dasher that is not worth a dime. The book that came with it says that once you get the compressor working and the inner chambre is chilled set the timer for 30-45 min-HA! The motor whimps out after 10-12 min. I wrote to the mfgr, and got NO response. Don't waste your money on this one, get one that chambre goes in the freezer-they have a MUCH stronger motor that will churn the ice cream until it is DONE!!!"
0,"Don't buy, camera doesn't last!!","We got this camera 3-years ago as a baby shower gift. The camera does not have high quality video indoors, the battery life is really short (lasts only about 30 minutes after being fully charged), and we ended up with the black screen of death (see reviews for Samsung SCD23 MiniDV Camcorder with 2.5 LCD). I would expect a video camera to last much longer than 3-years. I'm very disapointed with this camera and would not recommend it to anyone."
1,love love love,I've searched for penny loafers in my size at a good price since September.I finally found these and big kid 4 is a perfect match for women's 5-5!!Love them.Thank you....
0,did not receive,The product and price were agreeable and I ordered it in plenty of time to receive it for my trip. It never arrived and when I returned from my trip I inquired directly to the company and they said they sent an e-mail explaining that it was NO LONGER AVAILABLE and that my credit card would be credited. I went back to check my e-mail log and no e-mail was ever received by them. I would order at least 2 1/2 months prior to your need to avoid this problem.
0,"Way too expensive given the length of this ""short"".","I didn't realize how short this was when my daughter asked me to order it. Given the length of the film, the price was way too high."
1,Durable Product,"Purchased for my father. He likes the fact he can carry it anyway he wants and still have it work. He already got it wet, but dried it out and it still fully functions."
1,Spirit Movie Soundtrack,"My children love this soundtrack...the only problem is that when they hear it, they can't help but to look around for the image of the movie...they've listened to it so many times that they sing along --even the 2-year old!"
1,Liked it,I liked this cd but it is to much like the others I have .I was looking for new music from the show and I have most of this on the first Miami Vice CD. Nothing really new maybe a few songs but good anyway.
0,"Same as the first, but what was MS and Bungie thinking??????","You got to be kidding me. It took 2 years to develop this game when it carries the same basic principles as the first Halo. Atleast GTA series is different in many aspects as apposed to this boring title. First off, the game is way to easy. Hardly any changes in overall game play. This game is 99% hype and .5% joke and .5% fun. Second, I've run into graphic and image overlays and significant stutering during game play. Graphics are improved but still very much similar to Halo 1. I was able to find this game for 39.99 at a local computer store. Its not worth it. Maybe 29.99 or possibly a rental, but certain not for a purchase. If you look passed the hype, the game is nothing more than Halo 1 packaged as Halo 2. With this joke, maybe the rumors are true that MS may back out of the gaming environment......."
1,Really Good Movie!,"While I have yet to see this movie, it looks great. Nelly is talented and their is Brief Nudity."
0,Poorly designed... go with Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet instead.,"In addition to the other complaints about this product, on my unit, the rubber o-ring failed after only a few uses. Additionally, the charging port is protected by a rubber stopper to keep water out, which does not work all that well. I upgraded to the Waterpik Ultra Dental Water Jet which is an outstanding product. If you have the vanity space in your bathroom, and an electrical outlet nearby, then I highly recommend the slightly more expensive model."
0,"Has good ideas, but too simple.","Not much of a challenge would these games give any kid. Most of these games you could probably play sitting in your window. The card games aren't fun except the football games and the rest of the games are easily ""think-upable"". If you really wanna have fun on the road, either bring a cell phone and talk to your friends or count something. It's much better than spending money on this!"
1,love it,i recommend this book and others in the series for all children and parents and grandparents..Each home should have a set.
1,duct tape to attach ring flash,I attach the olympus ring flash using the sigma hood (which comes with the camera) and a little duct tape. it works great.
0,Outraged!,"I am outraged by the fact that I have been waiting for a power replacement adapter for my $400 Kindle since January 4 and haven't been able to use my machine because the adapters are not yet in stock and Amazon has no idea when they might be!!! How can a company do this? I suspect that there are plenty of adapters sitting around the office in Kindles that have been replaced by Kindle II; why can't someone from the company who has the new Kindle sell me their Kindle I adapter and wait for the new ones to come in? Or, open a Kindle I box, sell that adapter and replace it and repackage when the other adapters finally come in. I paid way too much money for a reader that is useless!"
1,A book that gives one a philosophical look at the 80's.,"One should read Johnson's book as a history of the 80's, not as a book about Reagan. Johnson paints a fascinating view of how the person in the Precedency is irrelevant, it is those he chooses to advice him. The book also verifies, ""man is not altruistic by nature."" One needs only look at what happens when institutions are given free rein; the institution will use the freedom for its own benefit.Johnson makes clear anyone can be successful, in business or politics, as long as they choose the right people to run things."
1,It gets you there,"This book will truly tell you what you need to know, but you'll have to hunt for it. It's packed with information but badly edited and the index is near useless. It's badly organized as well, so you might have to look in several places to find info on a single topic. It's rich in info on some topics and pretty skimpy on others. Still, if you've got the patience to sit down and read it from cover to cover you'll be well prepared to start growing. So far we're satisfied with our results and we've avoided many of the pitfalls of first-time growers. I especially liked the case studies, colour pictures and grower anecdotes. The seed bank listings and URLs are also useful."
0,Ah ... Memories.,"I had the mispleasure of seeing The erotic adventures of Zorro at a bucks night quite a few years ago.The opening lines have become the stuff of legend to a group of us, and i quote ..."" 50% of the people in this city are men .... the rest are women ""Believe me it goes downhill from there.Don`t touch this one !!!"
0,Not worth the money,This vacuum is not what it is advertised to be. The first two weeks it worked great although it is heavy to push around and then it was impossible to push either forward or backward. I called Dyson and they had me remove two rubber strips from the bottom and it seems to work a little better now but I would never buy another one. The wand is a nightmare with hardly any suction at all and the accessories keep falling off if you bump anything even slightly... So not worth all the money for the name Dyson...My phantom that I have had for 13 years is a much better vacuum and still working great so I will go back to using that.....
0,Hard for a kid to put together,"I wouldn't buy this puzzle for anyone under 6. It's difficult to put together. Once done, I glued it together to hang on my 4 year olds wall as I know he will not be able to assemble it on his own for a while. While cute that it's ""spidey"" shaped, it doesn't allow the ""fill in the blank"" concept of other puzzles. Good- but for older kids. Fun- rating 2...come on it's a puzzle...really how much fun could it be. Educational 2- slightly more educational than a standard puzzle. Durable-2-it's cardboard...depends on how cardboard holds up at your house."
0,I would be ashamed to cook like this,"I am a very busy working mom and I am challenged every day as far as putting meals on the table for my family. But, personally, I would be ashamed to use so many fatty, processed, canned, chemical-laden ingredients in my cooking. No matter how busy I am I wouldn't serve my family ""chicken stew"" made from canned chicken, jarred gravy and tube biscuits. Take out pizza is healthier."
1,A Great Madonna Album,"Ok, while Ray of Light may be an unfair comparison to Pink Floyd's Dark side of the Moon, Pet Sounds from the Beach Boys, or Beatles Psychedelic songs that we all love, Madonna's material on this album ASPIRE to that greatness. I like the mood it sets...space odessy like sounds with a bit of mystery, along with great beats (the ambiance makes you feel good). I think it's one of her best albums where her voice works well with her music......and for the first time ever, I actually agree with the critics......her singing lessons from ""Evita"" really paid off on this album. She's singing at her best and her material feels more mature too.Songs that catch my attention (besides those well known hits off this album): Substiute for Love, Swim, and Nothing really matters.Ray of Light is quite unique. It leaves me longing to hear more of these types of songs from her......and that's when I know it's a good album."
0,Very annoying and depressing!,"I bought this CD because I heard AFI was a cool band and I had heard the song Days of the Phoenix on the radio and thought it was cool. One day I heard Girl's Not Grey and I loved it. Another thing that attracted me was the price it was very cheap for some reason, now I know why. This CD isn't even worth purchasing. It's got nothing good to it. If you want a good CD pick up Finch's ""What It Is To Burn"" or Coheed and Cambria's ""In Keeping the Secrets of Silent Earth: 3"" those are two CDs that are well worth your money. Don't waste your money!"
0,The worst archive that DC has put out,The art and Bob Haneys stories make this just pablum. I remember been 14 and thinking its got a few good stories in each issue but when taken all at once and for the price your money is better spent elsewhere. The Classic B & The B were The Viking Prince and the Silent Knight. Regretfully this isn't the classic in fact its far from it :(
1,Strikingly good movie in many ways,"Oddly enough for an action movie the relationship between the two main characters was the most original and refreshing part. It was a very subdued and was limited to touching of the hands. Which I really liked this in contrast to the typical ""mid film he bangs the sexy girl"" scenes that are so typical. Everything else was richly done but this was the most striking."
1,Great surprise.,"I don't know what made me rent this movie, but boy oh boy, I was pleasantly surprised! I love watching food network, so watching this poor girl struggle through this dinner, trying to find ovens in strangers homes to cook her turkey, due to her own oven being dead, of all the days of the year, was heart warming.Ive never been a big fan of Katie Holmes, but she is great as a bit grungy, passionate and real April, far cry form her days on Davson's Creek, where her rolling eyes and immature faces were annoying. She gives a great performance, alongside of Patricia Clarkson, her cancer ridden mother.You must see it to believe it. The cinematography is a bit rough but cozy, this movie feels so different than any other movie you see these days.Great filck, and a very pleasant surprise."
1,AWESOME,"This is an awesome video it has Gospel Gangstaz, Kirk Fanklin, Trinitee 5:7, Walter Hawkins and etc. B-Rite and Gospo Centric put this wonderful video together and it is worth ordering and you can get your praise on! It really is good for when you feel like watching a music video and chillin at the house!!"
0,They squandered their chance to make a great Hymnal better!,"This is a terrible Hymnal. The type is thin and difficult to read, and they start one hymn on the same page where another finishes rather than starting each hymn on it's own page. They've made the words *Gender-Neutral* (i.e. ""Good Christian Friends Rejoice"") and needlessly changed the wording on several hymns to make them more Politically Correct.The group that compiled this sorry excuse for a Christian Hymnal had a wonderful opportunity to make the superb 1940 Episcopal Hymnal even better than it already was. Indeed, they did add a couple of good new hymns, but they also deleted far too many excellent hymns from the 1940 Hymnal.All in all, it was a dismal collaborative effort by non-musical, politically-driven cretins. It is still in use by most Episcopal congregations today, perhaps partially explaining the disarray the Church finds itself in today."
1,"redefines ""guilty pleasure""","Can't add much to what has already been said. So full of brilliant one liners that it will change your speech patterns for life. I don't know about paying this much for it. rent a copy somewhere and keep it. If the video store complains, just cap them."

1,"Grace, Gusto...Guys??? Yep..Guys (at least me)","I'm a guy, and will never been mistaken as graceful, but that won't stop me from trying to be. I found this workout a little bit humbling in that I had to drop my arms a few times, i was stunned at how much they were being worked by what looked like an easy to do tape, led by a great instructor. This DVD works, although I did fall over a few times during moving tree pose...there's that non-graceful part. It is indeed something to work towards, and far more challenging than it looks. I read somewhere that mind body fitness is the new way to go, and Ellen Barrett has been considered one of, if not the best, instructors in this field, she'll get no argument from me...sore arms and all. Guys, try this with an open mind, you might be in for a shock...I was, happily so..this workout works everything, mostly I felt it in my mood, my productivity level at work, and my overall out look on life!! Awesome way to spend 45 minutes!JerryCape May, NJ"
1,"Well worth the read, but frustrating.","As literary fiction, The Story of B is just deadly; but it is well worth the read as a philosphical dialectic. The vision (not the program!) revealed is important and exciting. The greatest frustration is: what to do with the message once received? Quinn is quite clear that anything less than a total response is an exercise in futility, but he offers no other direction. Other than the idea that spreading the vision is fundamental to true salvation, that is...."
0,Really wanted to like it,"I really wanted to like this album, but...1)Some of the music is ripped off wholesale from Metallica and Megadeth.2)Some of the music is ripper off from their old songs3)The songs sounded like they were hacked together as quickly as possible, which probably caused the two problems listed above. After reading the other reviews, I'm guessing this is because the album was written in only 3 weeks. I'm actually surprised. I would have guessed it was written in 3 days.4)There only seems to be one style on the album: play heavy. There is little to no variety and most the songs sound surprisingly similar.5)All of their other albums were far better, even the bad ones.6)After listening to it, I felt like I'd bought a used car with no engine."
0,drop dead fred,"When I received this movie is was just sliding all around inside the case. it was not secured inside, This is a Christmas gift;I sent you an email asking for another movie to be sent out but i never received your reply. So as of right now I would not order any more movies from your site."
0,Not useful,"Unfortunately, this is poorly designed. It is too high to rest you wrist on comfortably and the 'stimulating' rolling rubber parts are too hard and abrasive."
0,dont risk,"first i'd like to say that i hate 1 star reviews and people who nag about crap that isnt related to the functionality of the item...I bought this item because of all the good reviews it received and didnt believe the 1 star reviews that said it leaks, but sure enough it started leaking on me a few days ago. for almost $20 you think they might sell a bottle that wont have an issue that defeats its purpose... you cant return it for a full refund after the first month"
0,The decline of western civilization is upon us.,"Of course, the word ""civilization"" is probably too complex a word for these 11 year olds to understand. Skim through these titles... what, did a toddler write these? Yes, you have a crush on this 'cute guy'. Big deal. And their voices... pre-pubescent girls singing is always highly irritating. ""I kissed a boy""... ooo! Fasinating! Was it ""the boy next door""? You dirty dirty little girl. Of course, in their defense, primary grade children don't care about intelligent song writing, which this is completly lacking."
1,A good astronomy book for beginners,The book contain short information on every aspect of astronomy.It is well written with good methodology.The draft are not so clear and in astronomy they have to be three dimssion coloured drafts.
0,Poor attempt at a mystery,"I was disappointed at the end of this movie...disappointed I wasted 91 minutes of my life! I did give the films two stars: one for Benjamin Bratt and one for the cinematography that effectively brought out the dark atmosphere/overtone of the film. Aside from that, there in nothing else worth much in the film. The storyline is very predictable and the acting wasn't too hot.Rent this if you love Benjamin Bratt or are in the mood for ""Mulholland Drive"" type movie..."
1,Good Fun! Great Memories!,"I fell in love with the original ""Mad Scientists' Club"" when I was a boy. To be able to read this little known ""prequel"" is great! The story is fun and surprisingly plausible for the most part. The writing is a little choppy at times (which may reveal some editing the author didn't have a part in) but nothing that detracts from enjoying the story. This tale brings me back to when I was a child and life was a lot more innocent and fun! Enjoy this book as a family!"
1,loungecore is funque-a-licious!,"i am in total love with this cd. when i first bought it, it rarely left the cd player, so good was it. all the songs harken back to a time when bad was good and good was definitely bad - you grok? these songs are not only make up the soundtrack to movies from the late 60's and early 70's, they make up the soundtrack to daily life even now, in the new year / decade / century / millenium. find yourself a burnt umber butterfly seat, a madras on the rocks, and enjoy!"
0,NO EXTENDED versions!?!,"I as well am very disappointed that this and the 4th do not have extended editions of the movie. that is the ONLY reason that I bought the 1st and 2nd ultimate editions. I bought the 3rd without reading the cust reviews so my bad there, I doubt it very much that I will be buying the 4th. I don't think I will even be watching the 3rd since it is the same as my 2-disc set. :( very poor planning of Warner Bros. when getting these together."
0,the pics are better than the words,"I love the way this book looks...every page made me hungry. But the recipes are bit difficult to follow and they all seem to be missing some essential ingredient. In fact, 3 out of the 3 recipes that I made--following the recipe faithfully--were terrible. Give this book a miss."
1,A true gaming classic of ANY genre,"Once you get past the clunky game control issues (NO mouse control!), you will find that Silent Hill is a true work of the gaming arts. It has -- by far -- the scariest atmosphere available in any game; and with a truly adult and moving story line. Until I played it for the first 20 minutes, I was about to simply throw the game away as merely another annoying puzzle-type game (which it is not) -- until I found out just how good Silent Hill truly is. Find out for yourself -- and the price is a steal!"
1,Riveting and Exciting,Mr. Cummings has created a composition that is modern and melodic. Thought provoking lyrics combine with tight performance to engage the listener in an experience that is satisfying on all levels. I recommend it highly.
0,sock size up,Sock was as pictured and described. No complaint about that but it only gave me a leg cramp and welt from the tightness of the sock encasing my leg. For those reasons I was disappointed but this could just be me.
1,Hilarious!,"When I first saw this movie, it was at midnight on a random cable channel because I couldn't sleep. Never have I been so grateful for my insomnia! This movie was funny and rang true from begining to end. As a native New Yorker I couldn't stop laughing at every typecast Renee Taylor hit right on the nose, and the witchcraft backdrop reminded me of my grandmother. And who doesn't love the story of Romeo and Juliet? The only thing that annoyed me is I missed the ending, but I'm going to buy myself a copy!"
0,"Hearth & Garden Barbeque Grill Cover, 58 Inch","The Hearth & Garden Barbecue Grill Cover, 58 Inch, ordered 18 months ago is a total failure. This material the grill cover is made of has turned brittle and is falling apart. The product is unsatisfactory.Steve"
1,Slightly Biased,"I admit my review of this CD might be a little bit generous because I am a hardcore Jen fan.I enjoy all her music, because it sounds really sweet to me and sometimes I just need a break from the hardcore rap stuff. This CD was pretty relaxing and enjoyable. Although I must admit the Dear Ben song was pretty cheesy and not very good at all (and quite obsolete considering she is married to Marc), I liked the rest of the songs. Her major hits like Jenny From the Block, I'm Glad and Baby I Love You are all included on this CD. Not the most vocally impressive CD, but nevertheless very sweet. You are THE BEST Jennifer!!"
1,"The best of the ""fractal"" trance artists","Some very interesting music, much of it ""programmed"" or laid onto what sounds to be ""real"" instruments, rather than just the usual fake synth boop-de-beep noise. Some cuts, like ""A Bend in Time"" will totally mesmerize you with the complexity and blending of different beats and instruments into an experiential whole. Others take more time to understand, but all are quite unusual. Kudos to Fang!"
1,I'm happy to have a Pollock on my floor!,"My cat doesn't care about art but he sure loves this Fish. He was a stray that we took in and he's a ruff-neck that kicks this toy up. It holds up very well to the beating and the aroma lasts a long time also. He entertains himself for an hour with this and he's one that gets bored easily. IMO, it is definitely worth the money. The bananas are good also but not quite as long, the cigars work but because of the color, we're constantly stepping on them and freaking ourselves out."
1,"Easy to install, nicely built card","Installed this card in minutes including all the software upgrades available on the Adaptec website. Instantly hooked up all the existing USB peripherals and all worked just fine.Hooked up a USB 2.0 peripheral and experienced the high speed transfer rates.Bottom line? Nice card from Adaptec, well worth a slight premium over cheaper models."
0,Make sure you have an extended warranty from the dealer...,"I have been recommending this camera up until three weeks ago, precisely the week the warranty expired, when my camera malfunctioned. Sony wants a flat rate $150 to repair. Goodguys.com did not offer an extended warranty on the item, which should have been a tip-off for me. If you are considering purchasing this product (aside from the malfuntions worked wonderfully for me), ensure that you have some sort of extended warranty."
1,Jesus Talking Doll,"This is a quality item, well made with removable clothes. Easy to understand with jointed arms, fingers, legs and neck. My son loved it."
0,mirage,"Mr. Hicks plays on the inexperience and the desperate. He focuses only on the successes and does not mention the possible pitfalls in real estate. I found the book somewhat informative, but was quite annoyed with his pitch to subscribe to his publication."
1,A Life Changer,This book has changed my life and there is not 1 person who I know that read it that has not said the same. A MUST READ!!

1,Classic powers.,"Its great to get all three movies at once. Plus i'd forgotten about spies like us... Oldey but goody. I recommend this two disc, four movie collection if your into goofy comedies."
0,Not the guide you want...,"Potential buyers should know that this ""guide"" is essentially little more than a list. About each school or day care, it contains address, tuition, and 3-5 more lines of information.I went looking for such a guide because I was dissatisfied with the Independent School Guide for Washington, DC and Surrounding Area (I have 10th edition), which has about a half page per institution, plus sections on how to choose, consultants, other information. While neither has any sort of ranking or comparative information (what I was after), the Independent School Guide is much more informative and detailed than the Washington School and Daycare Guide."
1,Classic TV at it's finest,I was born in '69 so I didn't get in on this show until just a few years ago when it was introduced to me on TV Land. I absolutely fell in love with this show from the very first episode! I have Season One and Two and the second one is every bit as good as the first. I am losing my patience though waiting for season three. I think the fans have waited long enough so what's the holdup. I get sick of seeing shows that haven't even been on longer than a season already being put out on DVD and they can't even compare to the Beav. I find that the shows that were before my time are far more entertaining and are not offensive like tv nowadays. So my message to Universal Studios is to get the lead out and get going on future seasons of Leave It to Beaver!
0,A little bit of metal wouldn't hurt?,"Fine tool for ""small delicate projects"" mainly because the wing nuts used to tighten the guide bar (for straight and circular routing) are made of plastic with a metal screw. It is impossible to tighten them enough to keep the tool working straight. On a solid wood project the tool jumped around because of the way it loosely sits in the plastic base. Because of the vibration the screws that are meant to retain the depth of cut unscrew them selves, changing your settings unless you really lock them in place. Yes; for small delicate projects, but be ready for a lot of troubleshooting and make sure you practice on some scrap so you totally know what you are getting yourself into :)"
0,"Poorly Made Zipper, Beans Everywhere!!!!!!!!!!!","I received this product on September 30th, today is October 8th and I have spent most of the morning vacuuming the styrofoam shaped beans that are inside of this bean bag. I thought (and hoped) it had become unzipped but upon further inspection I noticed that the zipper had spilt. The zipper is poorly made and if possible I would like a full refund or a replacement."
0,Not real happy,"I've had this feeder several years. While I haven't noticed the squirrels getting into it like the reviewer above, I have had a problem with the feeder being balanced to the rear. This effectively pushes the seed away from the opening after the birds eat everything they can reach in the opening, making it necessary for me to go and shake the seed toward the front way too often. I have several other feeders of this type which are much more satisfactory. On the plus side, the birds like eating from it."
0,SAVE YOUR MONEY,There is nothing I like about this product.I would not recommend it to anyone - friend or foe.Sorry
0,Nice Idea...,"While this product is a very good idea, it was not properly or effectively executed. First of all, I have a 12lb Miniature Pinscher, and the size medium is kind of tight on him. And, he is by no means overweight. Occasionally, he likes to mark, so we figured this would be a good purchase. We were wrong! The item is not soft to the touch, and it has tight elastic, meaning it bunches too much and tends to squeeze his belly. There seems to be extra fabric, and it almost looks like a diaper or ballerina tutu on him. He looks absurd. Our dog does not particularly mind the product, but it slips and slides, making it ineffective. I noticed some wraps on Amazon that were fleece and appeared to be better quality. I will be purchasing them next."
0,"DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!! (Wonderful film, horrible DVD)","I am stunned at all the 5-star reviews here--they are all reviewing the movie Rikyu (which is definitely a 5-star movie) and not the DVD that you will be buying. The DVD is the worst I have ever seen. It will frustrate you if you try to watch it, and will frustrate you even more if you know how good this movie actually is.This DVD would be a rip-off at $1. It is grainy, contrasty, and blurry. Nobody will enjoy watching it.And if you buy this, you are rewarding people who are treating this masterpiece this shabbily."
0,WHAT HAPPENED ?,"As a relative newcomer to D.T. (having only heard SFAM and IMAGES AND WORDS), my expectations were high prior to purchasing this one. I have to say what A DISAPPOINTMENT !!! Where are the catchy hooks and good songs that filled ""Images"" .It sounds like they were just putting this out to satisfy a contract. These guys are great musicians (especially Portnoy and Petrucci),but this disc lacks good songs and good production. It just sounds like a typical 90's band trying to be heavy, but with no substance.In fact they never really got it back together until SFAM. Buy ""Images"" and ""SFAM"" , avoid everything else (except maybe ""Six Degrees""). If you really want to hear these guys (most of them)play with substance and style get either of the ""Liquid Tension Experiment"" discs. Those are hands-down superior to this one."
1,Great toy!,"I bought this for my son since because he is a HUGE sesame street fan and I've been buying him all of the characters. I am happy with this Bert however the Bert I received was different from the Bert that was pictured. His mouth is open instead of closed, the collar of his shirt is different and his shoes are blue instead or brown. Even though these are different I am still very happy with the doll and plus it looks better with a open mouth then a closed mouth. And in the end as long as my son is happy I am happy, and he LOVES this Bert."
1,A good review and reference book,Large coffee-table size. A good survey and history of modern astronomy and space science leading to our present understanding of our solar system and the greater universe Includes information on and from the space program and the value of remote sensing.Good r. As befits a National Geographic book there are lots of pictures and tables. This would be an excellent family reference book.
0,Like slogging through mud...,"I'm a pretty optimistic reader. I keep reading long after common sense would dictate that I cut my losses and move on. I have this hope that somehow, magically, the story will pick up, the characters will become interesting and my time will be justified. Not so in this case. I actually gave up after a few hundred pages of disconnected stage-setting. I found no characters in whom I was at all invested and no inducement to continue reading. All the hype on this ""masterpiece"" left me feeling either cheated or far less intelligent that I had supposed. Reading ""Suite Francais"" was like slogging through mud. Uphill."
1,"Sturdy, well-made jug.","The glass in this jug is quite thick and the whole thing definitely has some heft to it. It's very pretty and easy to carry, pour out of, hold, transport, etc. I never feel like it's going to slip out of my hand or even break if I accidentally ding it against the side of a table or something. It feels like it would take a pretty big fall to really do damage to this thing.It's very easy to clean, the glass is attractive, and the shape is perfect for its usage. Even though some of the parts are plastic, I'd still recommend this jug to anyone. The jug itself is lovely, even if the plastic parts aren't."
0,Oh Dear,"I gave this novel the old college try, but it just wasn't working for me. Why, I'm not sure. The writing was too thick instead of being narrative. I did give this two stars for being set in Russia--it always seems like everything is set in England. I made note of the reviewer from Russia and the reviewer who also made note of the Russian reviewer. Myself I haven't studied much about Russia, but I did think the names were rather odd. Really, if you're going to the trouble of writing a huge novel, what does it take to spend a day or two in the library researching yourself?"
0,"Junk, laser ink rubs off easily","I've used these labels in Clear for years, and ink from my B&W laser printer stuck to them like glue. But these paper labels can't seem to hang on to it. By the time I press the label down to the envelope, there are smudge marks everywhere."
1,its cool but,Its one of the best systems ive ever seen but there getting out dated if you are looking for compact youve found it but its hard to find any new games for them
1,Deaver continues to stun,"After reading the first Lincoln Rhyme novel and the current last, Empty Chair, I can honestly say that Coffin Dancer is Deaver's best in the series. It moves at such a fast pace and is so fascinating, especially the knowledge of forensic and physical evidence. After reading this book, I would question other detectives in other books who were not using such a great form of criminal detection! If you love intellectual, suspensful mystery novels, this book is a must. Another plus is that the ending of this book is so twisted from what you might have been originally thinking which is different than Bone Collector. This is the Deaver novel that should be made into a movie. You'll be fearing the coffin dancer and his criminal intelligence for weeks afterward!"
1,Oster 4716 egg cooker,Works well. It would be helpful if it had a loud signal when the unit was done. The hardboiled eggs can easily overcook when left in the unit. They take approximately 20 minutes and it is not practical to stay near the cooker. It is a good concept.
1,AN EASY TARGET,I got this book because my friend heard Jessica speak on her campus last week. She has been struggling with eating disorders since we were in high school. I read the book in one night (couldn't put it down) This book is for everyone and anyone who knows someone who is hurting themselves with this disease. I finally feel empowered to help my friend by helping myself be a better friend first. NO ONE SPEAKS TO COLLEGE WOMEN LIKE THIS!!Spread the word!
1,upgrade your adapter drivers first!,"The actual installation of the product was easy - included instructions are very clear - but I was only able to get a wired connection through the router once everything was set up. The Linksys product support boards address a number of issues between modems/adapters/operating systems and the moderators are very helpful and knowledgeable. I was armed with information from the boards and prepared to reset the factory defaults and start from scratch, but once I updated my adapter drivers I was connected without a hitch. I highly recommend having updated drivers before you begin the router installation.I'm still using wireless-g adapters and am able to get 36Mbps throughput in my garage, which is downstairs and has concrete walls. Very happy with this product overall."
1,Excellent book!,We would have so much better results in our classrooms today if the principles and character found in these stories were still applied as a whole in our society.
0,"Overrated, but interesting.","This book has been described as one of the best books of 2006 and I disagree. Though it's an interesting premise, I got bored with it. The characters are underdeveloped, there is not enough introspection, and though it does a good job of detailing the life at this kind of survival of the fittest stage, I got tired of the ""The man sat. The boy watched the man sit."" etc."

0,READ THE 1 STAR REVIEWS BEFORE YOU BUY!,"It was just about 6 months old with a low to moderate amount of use when it began to leak water all over the floor. It buckled up our newly refinished wood floors while sitting there before we realized what happened. Then plastic parts began to break off of it. I brought it to a friend of ours who is a repairman for vacuums and shampooers. He looked at what was broken and said it wasn't worth repairing. It did do a good job of cleaning the carpet. BUT it is ridiculously difficult to set it up for the hand/spot attachment. I think they took it to the dump or I would attempt to return it. Amazon is good about that. Leaking is a serious problem for a machine and all the plastic breaking on critical parts is cheap, un-fixable materials."
1,HUNGRY!!!,"You know... i dont know what to say about this book. This book really change my life. Yeah, i have to admit it that Tommy change my attitude toward God, he is the one who makes me hungry for God, and he challenge all the reader to be hungry too. And when we are hungry, all i can say is: GET READY, GET READY, GET READY, GOD IS GOING TO SHOW UP!!!"
1,Another Place and Time,"""Nantucket Sleighride"" has got to be one of the best albums of all time.

Check out CDs by these incredible rockers!"

0,stupid waste of time,"What a piece of crap. And that goes for both volumes. Had it not been for the wonderful music clip on vol2, the whole thing would've just plain pissed me off. Stop wasting the world's time with mindless crap, Tarantino. Go get a real job."
0,Got migraines?,"You CAN hear this thing! Well, maybe that's because I'm under 25, but yes - you can hear it.Did it work on my dogs? For a day. Then they started ignoring it.Day 1 I was hit with a migraine - I get migraines every once in a while, take RX medication for it, etc. At first I thought it was a coincidence, took my medicine, was fine. Then the 2nd day...another migraine. Then the 3rd. And the 4th.Don't even waste your money on this piece of crap. I have 2 ""hard to train"" dogs, but come on - this thing is a joke."
0,Nearly Immediate Issues,"I bought this from Lowes less than two months ago and it is now completely useless. Within about a week, it had already started to develop cracks in the outer plastic around the indicator from the stress on the plastic from the interior pressure. I would have taken it back, but the package and receipt had already gone out in the recycle.And I am the one who installed it. I can say with certainty that it no trauma ever befell it, or anything that might have damaged it in the slightest.I had to take the thing off because every time we'd go to get a glass of water we'd get sprayed in the face like a Three Stooges gag. Never buying Pur anything ever again. If I could give it less than one star, I would.I guess don't buy this unless you are Larry, Moe, Curly, or Shemp."
1,I can't believe it's not everywhere.,"Really, you must look at this book for your classes. High School and College. I have a freshman composition class that just went wild discussing this book. In twenty years of teaching, I've never seen my students so engaged in anything."
0,BE CAREFUL,"This collection has two DVDs with 4 movies. However only one is worth watching...Shaolin vs Manchu. I would have given this movie 3 stars but the other crap that came with it renders the package a 2 star deal. I suggest you buy Shaolin vs Manchu for $4.99 unless of course you don't mind paying $5 extra for three ""kung-fu"" movies that are utter crap."
1,"Very, very cool","This video is totally awesome. It has the best of GN'R all squished onto this nice little video. It has 13 of the videos, from ""Welcome to the Jungle"" to ""Patience"" to ""Since I Don't have You"" and just about everything in between. A very cool item for every Guns N' Roses fan out there. Plus, you get to see the evolution of GN'R from '87 when it started to '93 when it came to a halt. Like I said, very, very cool."
1,"Great game, greater potential","First of all, all of these ""reviews"" should be wiped and limited to people who bought the game through amazon, because to review the game you need to own it and play it. 2000 people complaining about the DRM of a game they didn't even purchase is outright ridiculous.The game itself is a lot of fun, both for the editors and the gameplay. Technologically, Spore is an amazing feat of programming, and it was made in such a way that content patches and expansions can be made relatively easily. The game isn't 100% perfect right now, but because Maxis made it so that they can put in the content that got put aside during production, it deserves a full score. Once a few expansions and part packs are released even the people whining about the game not looking like it did at GDC 2005 will be satisfied."
0,Don't Go There,"This book was suggested for our bookclub because of the book critics review. However, not one of the twenty members of our club could even finish this book. A waste of time. The characters were uninteresting, did not capture anyones attention and the chilren were unbelievable. We are located in St. Louis and some of us knew the authors family. Where he got his characters remain a mystery to us. Boring and depressing."
1,"Written with Heart, Courage and Soul","Barbara Rose shares from her own painful experiences how she overcame them, and teaches us all how to transform any tragedy in our lives into a triumph.Her wisdom is profoundly astute, her writing superb, as it is channeled, the spiritual depth will help anyone to understand why certain events in our lives happen, and what we can do to turn them around for lasting positive change.She courageously speaks out for the masses, daring to expose the injustices that, as the book states, have fallen on deaf ears for far too long.I highly recommend this book to anyone who feels they have had more than their share of unfair dealings, especially if you want to turn it all around. I also recommend this book to anyone who is in a position to bring positive change for all. If I could rate this book, I would give it more than 10 stars.An absolute must read!"
0,Broken,What a waste of money I have owned my kindle a little over a year. It has black lines through it. I call customer service and asked if this happens to kindles she said yes. So it a throw away. I had the option to pay 180.00 more to replace it. But I think 15 months is a short time for the kindle to work after all we paid over 300.00.
0,Dialogue so bad you can see the pain in the actors...,"It looked like the actors in the movie were putting all of their trust in the director becuase they had no trust in the dialogue, which was terrible. The story line is jolting, the characters poorly developed, and the humor weak. Will ferrell does a decent job and so do the other actors but they have so little to work with it's a lost cause.I thought their was a really funny scene in the movie with a great performance from the actor who played the outside author the firm hires to write for them. Good job! Wait for it to come out on video."
1,digging up bones,"having just read jane kerr colhoff's ""bones in the badlands"" i have to say ""BRAVO!"" it is hard to believe this is a first effort...and i sincerely hope just the first of many. i want to know what happens to hattie and her friends...i am sure the badlands have many more interesting tales to tell, and jane tells them in a very entertaining manner. her knowledge of the area is deep, and facts like the taking of indian lands for the bombing range astounded me! the characters never strike a false note, and the scenery sounds almost otherworldly in its beauty. bring on the next one!!!!!!"
0,Broken jars,"I have to echo the complaints of several reviewers about the fragility of the glass cups. After chilling the yogurt and removing the lids from several of the jars, I broke off a large shard of glass. Are the lids simply too tight? Why aren't the jars Pyrex? This is a terrible problem. The yogurt maker itself works all right when the desired yogurt recipe is used. But what good is the delicious yogurt if the glass shatters when you want to use the yogurt?"
1,Rancid comes back and rocks the world.,"Rancid's new album Life Won't Wait is full of great new songs. They have one of the best punk sounds today and this album is the perfect example.

0,God Thing - Is There One?,"I feel now that there is no god. Nothing is omnipresent or all-knowing. We have been duped so to call your book the Mind of God is an oxymoron. Whatever I had undergone from religoin is foul and nothing sees or hears me in the last 13 years so I doubt if anyone will see or hear a god, let alone know it. If you wish to know what has occurred to me for the last decade, let me know. It will blow your mind."
0,An intreaguing design with obvious flaws.,"Upon purchasing my new Bodum double walled drip coffee maker, I was thoroughly impressed with its ability to make coffee, keep it warm, and interest guests. After a couple weeks of careful use, I went about my daily routine. After warming up the reservoir, I poured my coffee into the warmed reservoir (via instructions as I had every time). As I was sitting at my computer, about 10 minutes after the coffee had been prepared, I was startled by a loud ""pop"" and spent the next 10 minutes picking up glass, not drinking coffee. Being that I got the item for around $20, I am not too upset, though I would be thoroughly upset had I paid retail. I would not purchase this item again. Total p.o.s. in my opinion."

1,Really cute,i thought this was a really cute movie. It started out slow but came on fast. I love the part were David Arquette gulped down that cole slaw in the cafetria. Kind weird and cool at the same time.

1,Awesome Stuff!,"I really love the scent of the Citrus Cleanser. It is almost as delicious as the Lemon Poppy Seed Facial Cleanser, also by Burts Bees. This product works really well and keeps your face clear and smooth. Anything from this product line is really excellent and is all natural, which is great for those with sensitive skin. I recommend this or the Lemon Poppy Seed Cleanser. I also like the Garden Tomato facial soap and toner. That is the best for those of you with oily skin."

0,RCA Cassette Recorder,"I purchased three of these recorders because they were very cheap and I have experience them. The first one I opened for use would not keep playing the cassette. It kept tripping like it was at end of tape. The Pause switch on a previous recorder got stuck in the ""on"" position - so no more tape playing or recording. These recorders are becoming obsolete and difficult to purchase, so I buy them when I can. There is no portable recording alternative that has sinmilar sound quality."
1,'No it's not....',"Product features say there is no sodium...well, unless salt is now NOT considered sodium that could be true. BUT, salt is in the sodium family, so if you're looking for this seasoning to be completely sodium free, forget about it!! And it says too a serving size is 1/4 teaspoon, wow, that's like nothing! Bottom line: it's not a bad product, adds a little butter flavor, but it's NOT sodium-free."
0,Cannot Review,Cannot review this product because it shipped broken and I cannot get any customer service from hand held items! So I have a broken unit that is no good to anyone!
0,apallingly appalling,"This film could really be summed up in one word ""Appalling"". Van Diesel plays the archetypical 'action hero.' Yeah you've got it, the one whose status is big muscles and has 'I can't act' written all over his face! The trailer for the film looked absolutely awesome, which is the only 30 seconds worth watching for the entire film.I would love to explain in depth the details of the plot, but quite frankly I was too busy laughing at how pathetically shallow the plot was to even remember it.If you are a Samual L Jackson fan don't torture yourself by sitting through the film, not even the master himself can do it any justice whatsoever.Nevertheless as taste is unaccountable I can only recommend you rent this film from your local video rental store or whomever!"
1,Monkey fun,"This toy is simply funny to my kids. It makes monkey noises and while it gets a little old to me, it makes me smile to see my kids laughing when playing with it. This brand is durable and well made."
0,O dear,"I can't believe the price of this DVD.Amazon mostly has the best price but in this case it is actually cheaper to buy it directerly from Sullivan entertainment's website. It is over $10.00 less in price.I have seen a clip of this movie and it is so wrong,EVERYTHING has been turned around making all other Anne of Green Gables movies into lies and ruining what the original writter wrote. I love Anne of Green Gables and Sullivan Entertainment, but this just is wrong. So I will probably NEVER look at this movie."
1,Fast moving vampire tale,"Nikki James is a private investigator with psychic powers. She is trying to track down the daughter of a powerful man. That daughter is in the power of a vampire. Michael Kelly is tracing that vampire Jasper, who is the killer of his brother. Michael is also a vampire and he is drawn to Nikki. Nikki is not the most trusting person in the world and can you really trust a vampire?This was a very fast moving story, no down time at all. The characters are vivid and the story line twists and turns more than enough to keep it interesting."

0,Avoid this crappy CD at all costs !!!!,"This album is a disappointment, since at one time I thought Missy was one of the best female rappers. I was wrong. Is Missy even a rapper? She sings like crap, and her best bet is to stick to rapping. The beats are pretty good, but it's not worth the money. Avoid at all costs!"
1,An educatioal toy,I bought the toy for my granddaughter for Christmas for this year. She's into designing and I thought this might help her to get started. But I won't know if she likes it until after Christmas.
0,corner of case smashed,"DVD is fine, but the case was in another box inside a bigger box and still the corner of the case was smashed into many small pieces."
0,A lot of writing,"A lot of writing and very little knowledge or input from the Author on the subject.. If you like writing, this is the book for you~!"
0,"Disappointing - 1 Solid Chapter, 2 pretty good ones, and 9 Chapters of Filler","First, let me say that I'm a pretty big fan of Les Edgarton'sHooked: Write Fiction That Grabs Readers at Page One & Never Lets Them Goand I was ardently hoping that this book would be just as solid and useful as the first book of his that I had read. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. Finding Your Voice had 5 Chapters of stalling and padding, a few solid chapters on voice, and then another bunch of filler. Take a look at the Table of Contents and you'll see what I mean. This book wasn't worth the asking price, let alone the time to read it.Now there aren't many books dedicated solely to ""voice,"" but there are a few that have a few chapters on it with material that is more than the equal of this book's. So here's what I'd recommend you buy instead:Movies in the Mind, How to Build a Short StoryandThe New Strategy of Style"
0,Verbose beyond belief,"Rambling is not literature. Like some chatty old Mexican who yaps endlessly about nothing, this author can't get to the point. I gave up reading this book fairly quickly, but based on the reviews here it seems like the author has something of value to say. This made me reluctant to give the book one star. But then I reconsidered. After all, to have something worth saying, and then submerging it in a sea of verbosity which makes it inaccessible to anyone who values their time, is actually worse than having nothing to say at all. So one star it gets."
1,A Pageturner,"Before I get to the book, I should review the reviews. Heady stuff. Half are from the same Internet troll using different names. And all the reviews combined only go to serve the point of this book, which chronicles a fascinating and bizarre men's subculture full of social genius and destructive ego. It verges on the brink of being a mainstream movement yet constantly sabotages itself with in-fighting.Oh, about the book: this is an amazing story. Period. It tells you the how-to along the way, but it reads like a novel. It's up there with The Dirt on my list."
1,Very Addicting!,I really enjoyed the book! I couldn't stop reading it all day! I like the resolution although some things remained unanswered and there are no more books to read after to find out what happened. Was the baby a boy or girl? Name? What happened with Rebecca and Buddy? Or with Josh? I didn't like how we were left hanging on those things. But the rest of the story was good!
1,Bobby's final collaboration with Marvin and Frankie .,"This 1976 release was Bobby's final album with both Marvin Santiago and Frankie Hernandez on lead vocals. Granted, this album was not as mind-blowing or as superb as its predecessors (1974's ""Rey Del Bajo"" and 1975's ""In Motion"") but is still chock-full of the heavy-duty, no-holds-barred ""Salsa Dura"" found on Bobby's Fania releases."
0,A ridiculous user's manual!!!!!,"Okay, I am no techie, I admit it, but I do not remember the last time I have witnessed a worse user's manual than the one offered by this LaPazz company, the manufacturers of DNA500 and DLA401 digital note takers. The product itself is okay at best. It is somewhat cumbersome and more complicated to put together compared to similar products but gets the job done in the end. But that user's manual is ridiculously funny. It is written in SUCH broken English that it makes the whole experience both annoying and frustrating, though at times, also funny. I find it hard to fathom that a company that invests so many resources in developing a product would then skimp on technical writing just to save a few yens.My recommendation - UNLESS you are a very technically minded person, STAY AWAY from this product UNTIL this company finally hires an English speaking technical writer!!"
1,"Review of ""It's Halloween""",I read this book when I was a child and it's scared me so much that I had to sleep wiht the lights on for weeks. It's definitely a classic!
1,A nice modern comedy,"I was sort of expecting something really silly and I was agreably surprised by the quality of this movie. A funny and intelligent comedy with the usual shortcomings but for the fun I had I am all to eager to overlook that :-) There is one thing that is really bother me: Honestly, would you like to be manipulated the way Tom Hanks does it with Meg Ryan ? I don't think so, really... He is clearly profiting from his position to maneuver Meg Ryan wherever he wants to. At least the moviemakers were wise enough not to make Tom Hanks offering Meg Ryan a job, that would have been quite cheesy... The DVD was really nice with some nice additional features like some views over the different locations where the movie was shot. I will try to see some of the places on my trip to New York :-)"
1,Water hammer surpressor,I have used mechanical times on my outside water faucets for years and when they shut off there is a large rattle and pressure builds up in the water pipes that has worried me. Because the basement was all finished there was no easy way to add a water dampening system. This inexpensive water suppressor that connects to the outside faucet works perfectly. Just remember to bring it in before the freezing weather starts. The suppressor attaches easily and the picture is incorrect but it works as expected.
0,boring,"Being in the mood for an easy read,I picked this up from my friend's bookshelf. It was more like a Danielle Steel novel, and the only reason I kept reading was to find out what happended at the end. There was nothing deep or meaningful,it wasn't even an enjoyable ""easy"" read."
0,Falling apart,"Like so many others have already said, the upper water container is defective. First the valve for the small soap container failed, so I had to add the soap directly in the water container. Now the water container valve has failed and whatever water goes in quickly comes out all over the floor. I guess it's time to search the internet for parts since the thing is unusable the way it is. C'mon Hoover, I expect better quality from a brand name like yours."

1,Great book for 12 to 13 year old boys.,My 13 year old hates reading but he really loves the Artemis fowl series. It is also an AR book.
0,The movie components have been ruined,"iPhoto, Garage Band and iWeb are great. IPhoto in particular is really much better than its predecessor, especially in terms of speed.iDVD and iMovie are disastrous pieces of software. iMovie no longer supports chapters. iDVD for me has been extremely unreliable and meant dozens of hours spent on forums finding out things like don't use music in the intros in certain 7.0 themes or your computer will lock up on encoding the DVD menus.Apple had a halo for me. Now I just think they're another cynical software shop."

0,"Geez, what a piece of junk","Satire is really really really rilly rilly hard to get right. People whose name is not Vonnegut, Heller, etc. should not bother to try, thankyouverymuch.Look, I understand what he was trying to go for, but it doesn't cut the mustard. Try Lem instead. Or try Canticle for Leibowitz... Sykaos is compared to that book sometimes and it is not a decent comparison-- Canticle is actually good, and Sykaos is very limp."
1,Barney movie is ok,Well I like the show better then the movie. Though if you are really a fan of Barney then you should watch his original such as this one.....Good Day Good Night W/ Pals
1,Nice Quick Read,This was a nice fast paced read. The setting contributes to the suspense along with an enjoyable plot. I have to hand it to the author for coming up with a very original ending concept. The adventure comes in waves and slowly builds to the entertaining climax. Lots of twists and turns in the story which lead to a suspenseful read. Fairly thorough description of the tropical environment sets the mood perfectly for the spooky action sequences. The plot does not take itself too seriously which allows the story to progress smoothly without a lot of unnecessary fluff. The opening chapters are fast and the rest of the book is even faster which leads to ta thrill ride of an experience.(Those of you who have read it will know what I'm talking about). It really is a thrilling journey for the characters as well as the reader.
1,A really great game for StarWars fans,"Many people give this game a bad review. But that should be all right. Everyone has different tastes. To me Star Wars Galaxies The Total experience is very fun. So what if there is a bad Combat Upgrade. Just keep on playing it. Here are some many pros and cons.Pros: Great retail price, The game includes the 2 expansions, You can meet new people, You can work for the Empire or the Rebellion, Meet characters from the Star Wars saga, And you have a choice to be diffrent Species ( My personel favorite is Wookiee) All Star Wars should like it.Cons: Must pay 15$ every month, Stupid combat upgrade.This is a great game. If you want an Star Wars experience that may never end, this is surely the game for you"
0,DO NOT BUY,"This book has an appealing title, but that is where all ends. For any person willing to learn and venture into buying notes, this is a waste of money and time. Cute little stories and end results will teach you nothing about buying notes and profiting from this business. This book misleads you into thinking you will learn something from reading personals experiences. Slow pace, and wandering story telling... Move on to better authors...."

0,A Movie That Proves...,...all the special effects and computer graphics in the world will never replace a good script and good acting. My hopes for Episode III are quickly diminishing.
0,Simple review,"I was intrigued by the title of the book so went to the 'quick view' to read a portion of said book. Here's my take: This is (at best) poor, undisciplined writing. To be fair, I only read the first 4 or 5 pages however, that in itself was a task. The writer strayed around the subject so often that I couldn't help but wonder if this was a book he wrote that paid by the word. The topic is very interesting and I'm sure that had the author been given legitimate editorial guidance the book had the potential to be a wonderful journey. As it is, I wouldn't buy this at any price - too difficult to follow much less to read."
1,An excellent book on the topic,"This book offers a detailed look at the causes and cures for the acne sufferers. The program he recommended is easy enough to follow on a daily basis. He doesn't recommend any of his products but we have to search for ourselves.I think the author doesn't want any conflict of economical interests to offer his product line but spread the true science of curing the acne itself. It took me a long time to search and locate all the products he recommended in this book, but I have gained more knowledge in the process. I have found the acnerx kit from a company that offers all products this author recommends.I like the author' acne cure program and I highly recommend all acne suffers to buy the book and follow his program. It's a good book. You won't regret it."
1,MechCommander 2,"An older game, but still one that is great. Fun command structure, decent plot line for an older game, and lots of replay value. If you have an older computer, this is definitely worth the time and money to buy. Still break it out often and try to beat some of the tough levels using mechs under 50 tons...thats a challenge!One note, you may need to used the compatability section in properties to get it to play properly in XP/windows Vista. Don't have W7 so I dont know if it will work there..."
0,It would be perfect if it came in different sizes,"This would be a nearly-perfect wrist brace if it fit correctly. Unfortunately, it is a little bit too small for my arms. It fits reasonably well around my hand but just barely closes around my (somewhat muscular, but not extremely large) forearm. Because of this, the whole thing just sits a little bit wrong.The item says that it is ""designed to fit women"", but I would alter that to say that it's designed to fit small women. It seems to be treated as a one-size-fits all item, which it definitely is not.Other than that, it's well-made and comfortable."
1,They don't make them like this anymore.,"Why wasn't this the best-selling album of 1993? I've listened to this CD countless times over the years, and I'm still astounded that it in withered in obscurity while similar-sounding but inferior products (Hootie & the Blowfish, anyone?) topped the charts.The songs are first-rate, and the arrangements are fresh and interesting, balancing sophisticated percussion and orchestration with earthier elements, like mandolin and dobro. I especially love the textural contrasts between Steve Moos's raggedy lead vocals and David Starns's gorgeous, overdubbed harmonies. If Bob Dylan and Brian Wilson had met as teens, they might have made an album together like this one."
1,Great book - a good introduction to Greek mythology,"I purchased this book for my 9 year old son as a companion book to several astronomy and constellation guides he requested for his birthday. He completely devoured it in three days - the illustrations are bold and the stories are dramatic/gruesome enough to capture his interest (without being too horrible or nightmare-inducing). We are finding that knowing a bit about the legends behind the constellations makes stargazing that much more enjoyable. I would recommend this book for boys and girls 8-10 years old, although I admit I enjoyed reading it, too!"
1,"Fantastic, yet strangely empty","The research is wonderful, the prose style is just fine, the detail is remarkable - I finished the book knowing more than I ever felt I needed to know about Jimi (and being grateful for the knowledge) yet no closer to any understanding as to what made the man tick. Any serious Hendrix fan must own this book, but it is, in an odd way - emotionally incomplete."
1,Celtic symbols and their significance,"When I first saw this book, my first reaction was that such a small book certainly couldn't contain any useful information whatsoever. The book is a mere 5"" by 5"" by 76 pages (if I counted correctly).However, after opening it up, I found that it is absolutely masterful in what it does. Most pages contain a picture of a symbol, and the accompanying text explains the significance that the Celtic peoples assigned to a specific symbol. Among the symbols covered are the triple head, the ram, the stag, heads and head hunting, and much more. As an introduction to Celtic symbols, this book probably has no peer."
1,great gift for a die-hard korn fan,"only five tracks, but worth the money if you REALLY love these guys (like me). got it back in fall of 2000...1 = sucks5 = average10 = kicks ass01 . ADIDAS (radio edit) - 6.5 - only difference is that they replace ""f/ing"" with ""hump/ing"", and the drums (especially the snare) sound more clear than the album version.02 . good god (dub pistols mix) - 9 - fun song, for some reason ""good god"" always has the best remixes.03 . got the life (josh abraham mix) - 3 - not that good...04 . twist + chi (live @ family values 99) - 8 - good song, sounds much better as one song together rather than two seperate songs.05 . jingle balls - 10 - if you're a death metal fan like me, then you'll enjoy this song. it's their version of ""jingle bells""...pretty unbelievable for a non-death metal band, but hey, jonanathan is a fan of morbid angel. if only he'd do a side project with songs like this one...it's overall a cool CD, but like i said, it's only worth the money if you're a big fan."
0,Not working,Not what I expected in a brand new product. It wont play even when I put in new batteries and I have to jiggle them to even hear a little radio. I bought it to play my audio books but haven't kept up with it because this thing really sucks.
1,The volcano eruptions at Nevado del Ruiz and Galeras.,"There are two stories in this book. The first is about the eruption of the Nevado del Ruiz volcano that resulted in the deaths of 23,000 people. The second is the death of six scientists and three Columbians in the Galeras eruption. The scientists killed were led by Stan Williams, who also substained very serious injuries. The three Columbians were local hikers in the area.If the focus was on numbers, Bruce should have concentrated her studies on the Nevado del Ruiz eruption that killed so many Columbians because of the mud slides. This was not done, but the focus was on diminishing the egotistical Stan Williams who led six of his companions to death. Both stories are worth a book of their own."
1,A very moving book,I first encountered this little gem as a bookseller and handsold it countless people. I gave it as Mother's Day gifts to my mother and mother-in-law. I don't have children of my own but it absolutely makes me bawl every time I read it. I had to get out a tissue just reading these reviews! It truly enforces the idea that a child learns to love others unconditionally when he is raised in a home where he himself receives unconditional love. As I get older I realize that someday I will be able to give back some of that love by caring for my parents. It's absolutely a perfect gift for anyone with children or aging parents or both.
1,I have been waiting for the product!,"I used to have the ugly yellow, green and red ABC mat that I have hated since I was forced to buy it because there was no better alternative. As soon as I saw this beautiful floor by Skip Hop my heart stopped and I was in love.I love the colors and the design it is so neat. I bought one immediately and said goodbye to those old ABC's. Now my playroom looks so cool and fun. It is all the rage in our mommy circle and my 18 month old could not be happier playing on it.Love this product!"

0,The dvd is defective.,"This dvd is defective. The second half of the movie has a ton of frozen moments which was very distracting. Didn't enjoy watching the movie at all. PLEASE REPLACE, and let me know what to do with this one. If you send me a paid return envelope and I will be happy to send it back. Please advise what to do."
1,Sunforce 50022 5 Watt Solar Battery Trickle Charger,In the past after a couple of weeks in the hot Florida sun the battery on my boat would be dead. Now that I have connected the Solar charger battery has a full charge when I get ready to go. No having to plan ahead and connect a battery charger over night and disconnect the next morning before leaving.Works Great Not a bad price either.
0,Very disappointed,"I use sunglasses on a daily basis , I have been using a different brand for years and they were discontinued so I ordered the apex glasses with high expectations but after the third day of wearing them the frames broke on the right side , and I was able to repair them , then the very next day the left side of the frames broke leaving them unrepairable....I was very disappointed...save your money !!!!"
1,Earth as most never see it,"This is amazing, captivating and awesome coverage of the most out-of-the way parts of our earth. Don't miss it- you will see things that few of us even knew existed. The coverage of caves is unbelieveable. The divers in our group of viewers were saying ""oh no, OH NO, ohhh""! We haven't watched the last cd yet- but know it will be just as great!"
0,"Incredible, I thought they'd be doing something worthwhile.","i am an everclear fan, and a large one i might add. i have loved all the records up to this point and been terribly pleased with the latest two. i thought they would just keep getting better. i can't believe how wrong i was. this is easily the worst everclear record and a gargantuan disappointment for fans like myself filled with lifeless songs, uninspired lyrics, brutal stupidity, musical immaturity, the list goes on. i cannot stress enough how much people who are fans of intelligent music will dislike this record. even if you liked the old ones, this one is new and full of garbage. terrible, don't pay a penny."
0,simply doesn't work properly,"I have never used a printer that is as worthless as this one. It simply doesn't work! No matter what type of paper I put in it, it pulls multiple pages through -- sometimes 3 or 4 at a time. Also, the first black ink cartridge ran out after very few pages were printed. (Unfortunately, it usually takes multiple tries to print a page so you wind up wasting both paper and ink.) HP products are usually outstanding. So I guess I recommend don't go cheap -- buy a high-end inkjet or laser printer, because you'll just end up throwing this one in the trash."
0,Wait for the movie,"Clear out the cobwebs and dust off a place on your shelf next to the Celestine Prophecy and The Bridges of Madison County. This book will soon be taking up space there. Ever so often a publishing phenomena such as the above mentioned comes along and captures the attention of the public then drifts into obscurity. The Da Vinci Code is such a book.It is poorly written with an agenda that is as transparent as the plot. As a screen play it may succeed depending, of course, on the quality of the production. Good casting could breath life into the one dimensional characters. Although I'm not sure what more Hollywood can do with yet another albino bad guy. A good screen writer might be able to do something with the hoakie story.Keep your eyes open it will soon be coming to a theater near you."
0,Worthless,"One line of Rilke's poetry, is of more worth than this entire book. And the publishers comment is untrue, Rilke's biographies are familar and Rilke has been extremely well documented. Even with serious flaws, Rilke is the ultimate poet looking at life, and sharing that poetic vision in a wonderous manner. You can trash Wagner (rightfully so) for his personality and some of his actions. But the music stands anyway, completely unaffected by the details of the source; so does Rilke's poetry. Completely worthless."
0,"They protest too much, methinks?","This reads like one long note of denial, and the other readers' reference to O.J. is right on the mark. At this point, it looks like no one will know the truth about this case, and it will never be clear whether they had anything to do with her death or coverup. This book doesn't shed any light on the subject. It just makes the Ramseys look like they are once again exploiting their daughter."
1,Air King 6-Inch 2-Speed Circulating Fan #9146,"This is a great little fan. I was looking for something for my bathroom. This fits on the back of the toilet perfectly. It's great for getting rid of the humidity and moisture on the mirrors and windows after showers. It's also perfect for those of us who have an occasional hot flash! Just one thing: circulating is not the same as oscillating. Some might misinterpret the title (as I did). As far as I know, all fans circulate air. If you want an oscillating fan, this isn't what you're looking for. But if you want a little fan with lots of power that fits into a small space, this is it!"
1,Entertaining season,"It was a good, solid season for Torchwood, but not great. The character development between Jack and Gwen felt forced and held back. The plot was interesting, but not spectacular. I enjoyed watching this season, but there wasn't anything in the plot or development that really drove me to finish watching and the pace and style felt too much like America prime time. I do look forward to future seasons."
1,Joey Mcintyre Proves himself on HIS SOPHOMORE ALBUM!,"Having been a male fan of Joey Mcintyre since NKOTB, I was very excited when he went solo in 1999 with STAY THE SAME. While that album was predictable and formatted, this new cd MEET JOE MAC truly shows that he has spread his own wings. He co-wrote his last album as well but this cd has a solid base of songs, melodies, lyrics, production, etc....the whole package is great! His voice seems stronger and more mature and his delivery is very convincing! I reccommend this cd to anyone who wants to hear a great POP record.....I am sure glad I bought it! MEET JOE MAC is the perfect title for an album that really introduces us and brings us into the world of JOEY MCINTYRE!! Way to go Joe!"
1,Perfection IS,"This Excellent Book contains the Highest Truths available today to mankind. Even the Sacred Books of India (Vedas & Mahabharata), are not as simple to understand and Pure due to translation & commentary. This Volume 3 is a Wonder of Wonders. One day it will be known by every individual on the planet. It contains some of the earliest Discourses by Beloved Saint Germain available. And, the Truths are Eternal so They will become a part of your Life with each Word you read. This Book is often read after reading first Volume 1 ""Unveiled Mysteries"" and Volume 2 ""The Magic Presence"" by Godfre Ray King. Then, one might want to read Volume 4 ""Ascended Master Instruction"" because These are the very earliest Discourses. Then, This Volume 3. All are published by the Saint Germain Press and as of 2007, there are a total of 20 Books which make up the Series of ""I AM"" Instruction."

1,Helix XM battery replacement.,"Works well but the reason I bought the battery is because the battery that my Helix came with was only lasting 2 days before needing charge (using it 1.5 hours per day). This battery lasts just as long, and if fully charged and not used for three days it is almost completely discharged (This also happened with the stock battery so nothing new here). I have not tried charging the battery and taking it out of the Helix to see how long the battery last fully charged and stored. In any case it works just as the stock battery so I can't complaint too much, specially for the great price."
1,Beautiful Book & Movie,"I disagree with the other reviewer, because I thought this book was very worthwhile and mine was in fine shape. The pictures are breathtaking and it gives you a nice insight into how they made the movie. It's meant to be a coffee table book and one that you look at from time to time. It certainly will put you in the Christmas spirit."
0,Want something that works?,"Why waste your money and time reading this book? In my culture, males are considered better than females, even though I somewhat believe in equality. After 2 daughters, I've spent 7 years looking for a way to have a boy! And I finally found a book that actually worked. But this book had been banned since the early 80's! I lucked out and bought it for a hefty price from a family friend (who didn't want to give it up at any cost). But it was worth it. It's old, ripped up, but useful so I've typed it all. EMail me at frisky1999@mailcity.com to get a photocopy of the original, or a even typed copy of it now!"
0,buy this book and you'll probably go broke,"If you don't go broke paying the obnoxious price of this book, you probably will go broke using Ted Warren's strategies(if they can be called that). As a professional trader I found this book mildly entertaing. For that I would have given it a rating of 3. But the fact that this book is $75.00(!) makes it a complete rip-off. Buccaneer Books should be ashamed for putting such an outrageous price tag on this book especially when there are much better books around at much lower prices. Ted Warren does not advocate taking losses early (a very dangerous policy) or at all for that matter. Two books that offer much more precise buying and selling strategies(and have made me money) are Nicolas Darvas' ""How I Made $2,000,000 in the Stock Market"" and William J. O'Neill's ""How to Make Money in Stocks"". These are both outstanding books on investing.END"
0,Lame metal,"This band sounds to corny,this seems to be for someone who is to afraid of real metal.A lot of people talk on how much groups like linkin park Limp Bizkit and papa roach suck,now add DT to that list.Maybe this group is not for me or you.Just stick to Slayer Lamb of God, Tool, Deftones, System of a Down, Dimmu Borgir, Meshuggah, Hatebreed, Rammstein, Alice in Chains, Shadows fall, Megadeth, Nile,80's Metallica, Black Sabbath,Nile, Mudvayne and Slipknot for good and hard metal."

1,Gioachino Rossini: Petite Messe Solennelle,"Gioachino Rossini: Petite Messe Solennelle is a recording conducted by Simon Halsey and produced and recorded by Conifer Records Limited. The booklet is sparse and has no photograhs or illustrations. It does contain linernotes in English, German and French written by Julian Elloway. This recording states also to be the first recording of the original version as Rossini himself had intended it to sound. 4/5."
1,Critique of Narrow-minded Dunderheads,"This film is well worth seeing. Not only is it an intriguing story and entertaining in that sense, but it is also an excellent social critique of the narrow-minded, judgmental people in a small town in the Northeast in the 1950s. It makes one wish that the Rock Hudson and Jane Wyman characters could have fled the town and that God could have then sent an avenging angel into the community, causing garment-rending and gnashing of teeth before smiting all of the inhabitants and detroying the town in a fearsome firestorm. Believe me, the townspeople in that movie deserve it!"
1,"Cuisinart TOB-155 Toaster Oven,","It takes a few times to figure out what settings work best. It toasts much more evenly than our other toaster oven. Lets you know when it is up to temperature. The one thing we have noticed is that the top of the cuisinart gets pretty warm, so I would not leave anything on it. Otherwise I would recommend this model."
1,vintage trip hop,"i like how the people who wrote negative reviews, did so in the year 2005. this album was released in '94. back in those days this album was excellent, with tracy singing in the right key and all! more than one can say for portishead. yeah, of course newer chill albums are going to sound better and fresher. if you spend all day listening to bt, then yeah, kraftwerk is going to sound a bit boring. does that mean that kraftwerk's albums sucked? NO! hell NO!"
0,What was she thinking,"I have been listening to this awful cd for 3 days, just to give it a chance.Sadly, It is by far the worst CD In my collection. Moreover, everything she has worked for in the past decade has gone down. She's a singer not a rapper, stop talking on your records and stop plugging designers and your own line [...]. The only 2 somewhat ok songs are the 2 singles, currently being played on the radio. Friends that have the CD and myself are very dissapointed (and we are all girls!!!); over arranged and over produced."
0,Awful..,"Trite. Boring. Teenybopper. Urban Legend is terrible, the sort of movie 12- and 13-year-old girls would line up to see. If you want a true horror flick, see any of the Omen series. Unless you go for teenybopper, you'll be disappointed by this one."
1,They are worth it,"We live in an apartment with a heating and cooling system that is so loud that you can't hear the tv. We were miserable. TV ears have made is possible to enjoy tv again. They are not always comfortable for long periods of time, but they work well."
0,Never got it,I tried emailing them twice and never got a response but it's now 9 days past estimated ship time and still nothing. Also. The worst part is they say they shipped it almost month ago!!!! I will never do business again with them
0,Not even wrong,"People who claim that stocks are overvalued are typically assaulted for presuming to know better than the thousands of intelligent investors who make up the market. How ironic then that these two superbulls maintain not only that they know better than todays investors, but that all past investors have been fools as well for not grasping the simple truths laid out in this book. Respected economists have shredded this book for its garbled logic; I on the other hand would merely like to offer anyone who buys into their thesis all of my future earnings, for a mere 100 times my present annual salary. What a bargain!"
0,Amazing for a kid---but have to rate as adult,"I think Jay's fame is not doing himself a service. He needs to mature outside of the spotlight. I think it hurts him that so much attention has been lavished on these youthful exercises. If he sticks with the study of music, eventually he's going to get interested in things like making a large-scale form work, handling transitions, editing material, etc... and he may wish these works were never published. I know that some find this music inspiring, especially considering it comes from a kid. Personally, I have to rate it by comparison with any other new classical music."
1,"Global perspective, global understanding","If you read Amory Starr's book, you know that the protests in Seattle weren't the first against corporate globalization. ""Naming the Enemy"" explains how this movement has grown from local campaigns against local problems to a planet-wide movement against a companies that turn people and the environment into commodities. Impeccably researched but written without using academic jargon, readable without being condescending, ""Naming the Enemy"" is one of the most important political science books in recent memory."
1,Havent Laughed this Hard in a While,"I saw this movie Saturday night. First of all, the movie had packed all the seats so we had to sit like in the 5th row. It was worth it. Steve was incredibly funny and just the stars were brilliant. Very crude language but fun and funny. The scene were he is gonna do it and the woman asks him if he has protection and he says he ""doesnt like guns"" is hysterical! I loved this movie and this movie has made the Anchorman director look good even though Anchorman wasn't a very good movie."
0,Speaking dictionary's use by hearing impaired,"I purchased this product for my hearing impaired, adult student who is reading at a first grade level. Because the student has no one at home to help him practice, he might be able to type in a word that is troublesome and be told what it is. However, the speaker is in the back of this device and when the volume is turned up, the speech is garbled and full of static. Speaker on the front would be a great improvement."
0,Too hard to put puzzles in,"My son puts his puzzles away very nicely at school, so i wanted to buy a puzzle rack for home. This is too hard for him to put the puzzles back in. It holds the puzzles fine, i just have to be the one to put them back."
1,great shoe holder,the only problem i notice (after 1 month's use) is that it won't hold size 12+ shoes. but we still have most pockets filled with kids' and wife's shoes/sandals and such. seems durable. very easy to hang on door. overall: great value if you want to save floor space.
0,Any old tom dick and harry's 0.02$ about XML,There wasn't one solid case-study or example application which demonstrated how to actually manipulate an XML Structure. Many of the screenshots are fakes. There are far too many forward references. This book was written using Cut & Paste. Almost exclusively Microsoft based -- do Micrsoft own this publishing company?
1,Too nice to wear!,"Exactly as described: soft, genuine fur, comfortable, leather uppers, rubber soles, correct size, original packaging, etc. As soon as I put these on my feet, it was like floating on air. Incredible luxurious feel! I highly recommend these slippers."
0,Useless noise and bad covers,"There may be some people who like this noise, but it is actually painful to listen to. Combine untalented vocals with busy mixed music, and you'll get this s***. The album is appropriately titled, as it is JIHAD on my ears.The whole point of covering a song is to make it better, but this is aweful. The covers of The Cure's ""Lovesong"" and The Smiths' ""How soon is now"" are, well for lack of a better word, hideous."
1,Works for anxiety,I have tried numerous products to help reduce my anxiety. I would get that sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach a lot when talking to people or when under stress. This is the only product that has helped me feel calm and given me a sense of well-being. I will be buying this in bulk! So glad to have found an herbal remedy that calms as well as xanax.
0,Expensive doesn't mean quality,"I have had other wireless head phones in the past and on a scale of one to 10, I would rate these a 5. These are too bulky and uncomfortable. Also they slide off your head when you happen to look down. It would be a better product if the ear cups were hollowed out. The band across the top of your head is very uncomfortable. You can solve that by wearing a baseball cap but who wants to do that. I will say that the sound quality is pretty good. I ended up buying a less expensive set of headphones for 37$. They are very comfortable and have very good sound quality.You can't beat the price and quality of Audio Unlimited."
0,JUST SAY NO!!!!!,"I cant NOT recommend this enough. This is without a doubt the worst film in the history of horror movies, well movies all together. The movie has a plot that falls apart in the first 30 seconds, and from there on its torture.I would recommend that anyone whos curious about this movie, let me put it this way - I would rather bang my head against a wall for a few days then to sit through another minute of this movie!"
1,wow not me,Great for anyone who likes adventure. Try this and find out what reaching your dreams is all about. The people who climbed would read this book and still attempt their climb.
0,Real Time Really One-To-One Book,"Regis McKenna is one of my favorite authors. This book however seems to be just a subset of ""Enterprise One-To-One"" with almost nothing new. And while ""Real Time"" is full of websites to related material, I could find no mention of ""One-To-One"" -- the most related work to this one.I expect no mention of ""One-To-One"" was intentional. I read all the books I can on this topic and this work in not worthy of Mr. McKenna or the Harvard Business School Press.This book makes me think of a review I read while in Grad school about a new philosophy book. The reviewer said: ""This book has much that is original and much that is good. However, what is new is not good and what is original in not new.""Read the ""One-To-One"" Books first"
0,Worked for less than 2 years,"After about 18 months, the unit quit working. Symptom? The dreaded 'no water' warning even though water was in the tank and showing on the side gauge.Will not be buying another Krups."
0,preachy and ahistorical,"Having loved the book as a girl and enjoyed the earlier film versions, I had high expectations for this remake. Sadly, those expectations were dashed. I didn't have as much of a problem with the movie departing from the text, because I believe that movies always interpet the books which inspired them anyway. My objection pertains to the degree or extent of interpretation. What I disliked most about this remake was its unrelenting preachiness and the ahistorical way it projected 1990's values into the past. I thought the book was feminist and modern in its own context, and so its variant of strong womanhood should have been honored on its own terms rather than devalued by reinterpreting it in our terms, while still locating the story in the past. In so doing, this movie implied that the best, the only valid, and the most enlightened feminism is the one we know today. That's just plain old conceit."
0,The Secret,This video is a con-artist dream. It preys on peoples's hopes and needs. It even uses a child to send this twisted message. This Secret has potential to cause much damage to people's lives. Hopefully the people involved with this will get their just do. Do not buy this video and give your money to these con-artists.
1,The Gutless Wonder,"If you read this book, you will believe that John Kerry was some sort of hero. The truth of the matter is that John Kerry never wanted to go in the service. He applied for a deferrment which was denied. Then and only then did he enlist in the Navy. He served only three months on his ""Tour Of Duty"" while the normal Tour of Duty is 12 months.Kerry then recieved three Purple Hearts which no commander ever approved. Kerry filled out the applications himself. Like baseball, three strikes and your out. After his three fake Purple Hearts, Kerry was sent home and started his anti war nonsense.In an exhibition, Kerry was shown throwing away medals and claimed he threw away his medals because he opposed the war. The fact is Kerry's medals are hanging in his office. Whenever Kerry is asked about this, he goes ballistic.John Kerry was no hero. He was a gutless wonder. [...]"
1,Great Pictures and Lots of information,This book had great action pictures of Cujo. I really liked the tips Cujo gave for younger players to help them to improve their game. I also thought Curtis Joesph's schedule at the end of the book was neat too. Anyone who likes Cujo or the Toronto Maple Leafs should get this book.
0,YOUR MONEY IS BETTER SPENT ON LOTTERY TICKETS,"If you would like to waste your time deciphering through typos, convincing yourself that you DID have the correct answer (regardless to what they have selected) and blowing precious study time with a book that should be tossed in a pile, banned and burned like in the early years, then by all means, fold your $20 up and smoke it. (Can you tell how annoyed I am?) AVOID THIS BOOK!!!!!"
0,Le Creuset but not REALLY Le Creuset,"Upon receiving this found that 1 it was a different size than stated, 2 it was made in Thailand which was odd and originally led me to believe it was a knockoff and 3 there was a rather large gap between base and lid, not cool for this kind of product. You want a proper, tight fitting lid. Returned this, went elsewhere and got the actual 10x15model for the same price. Very disappointed in the brand for putting out something this cheap."
1,Cute Title!,This story was so cute and yet hits home. I kept my class in suspense until the very end. Crazy good.
0,Disappointed!,We really love the CD but were very disappointed that the CD brochure appears to have been wet and is all stuck together ;-( Seller should have mentioned that in it's description. I had not been an ABBA fan until recently and was sad that I could not read the info!!
0,Poor by modern standards.,"I agree with ""Music Fan"".I'm sure Mr Morgan is a decent player but this recording does him no favours. The tone is un-focused and at times comes accross as un-melodic. What's with the breaks in the line in The Swan?? Changing octave mid-phrase is ridiculous. Many of the pieces simply don't stand up to scrutiny.Through history there aren't many tuba players I'd want to hear play a recital; Fletcher, Bobo and Jacobs come to mind.Consider what the most recent recording generation of tubists are putting out and it's another Solar System. Do yourself a favour and check out Mssrs Szentpali, Baadsvic, Sheridan and-so-on to see where the tuba's at these days."
0,easy and fun for 3-4yr olds,fun easy game if you can keep it from freezing. I've reinstalled it and done everything I know to do to correct the issue. It's a shame my 4yr old really likes it.
1,There's a few good remixes here,"Kathy's Song wasn't one of my favorite songs on Welcome To Earth, but a couple of the remixes on this single are actually an improvement over the original. The VNV Nation remix is a slow and haunting version, while a couple of others are faster club remixes of the original. Overall, it's a rather solid single."
1,Harlem as it once was and becoming again!,"There was a 1900 picture of my old neighborhood a street I walked across everyday. I was shocked I learned so much about my old neighborhood , I sent my mother and aunt a couple. They both grew up in Harlem also."
1,Skil 7-1/4-Inch Circular Saw with Laser,A great saw for great price . . . has plenty of power and seems to be built very sturdy. The only issue is the laser is too weak to be seen on the wood that you're cutting.
1,Good Up To 12 lb,"This is an excellent diaper until my baby reaches 12 lb. After that, it leaks at night because it gets saturated. I wish Pampers makes a size 2 instead of a size 1-2. Size 3 looks so hugh so my baby is now using Swaddler size 2 instead."
0,Poor design at a price,"I should have been warned by the other reviews---but noooo. I bought this quasi-useless gimcrack. The first clue about bad design is the top; the ""handle"" is a slippery ridge impossible to grip. The amount of ground coffee for any given setting---make that ""coffee dust,"" for this thing is the antithesis of coarse grind---varies considerably. I bought this grinder and passed along my cheap blade grinder to my brother. But now I think I want to swap back!On the coarsest setting, the coffee dust is so fine you may wish to use two paper filters. No way it would be suitable for a French press or percolator."
0,Didn't Help,"My husband had high hopes when he saw an ad for this product, but like most everything else he's tried, it didn't alleviate his symptoms at all. He said it didn't taste very good either."
1,IT WAS GREAT -A MUST SEE FILM -FUNNY,This was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen -- GREAT -- I would recommend to any adult ( Adult themes ) You'll love it --Oder it today !!
1,Audrey at her BEST,"For anyone that isn't familiar with Audrey Hepburn's movies, this is the best one to start with... in my opinion this is her best work. Roman Holiday is the movie that started it all for Hepburn, and you'll see why. This is one of those movies that you can just escape in... it brings you into a fun, safe, playful world. Hepburn and Peck are a perfect romantic match in this classic movie. I whole heartedly recommend this film to anyone!"
0,VERY DISSATISFIED WITH THIS ITEM,"This table & chairs set was purchased because of the high ratings given by previous buyers. This was a Christmas gift for my twin grand children and it is not suitable for them to use for years as advertised. I am totally dissatisfied with the quality of the material used to make the table & chairs - very ""soft"" wood that marks easily with a finger nail & the table arrived with a crack in it!! Complained to the seller, sent pictures of the damage & received a new table top ONLY that was of the same poor-quality so-called wood. To get a new replacement that would hopefully be better I would have to pay shipping to return the defective set! Not very good customer service and really crappy product. Would NOT EVER recommend this product or seller to anyone!!! TOTAL WASTE OF $100!!!!!"
1,Best of the best in NC,"I remember watching them jar this stuff in the back of a small cafe in Morehead City, NC many, many years ago. At one point there were many other sauces with such wonderful names as Blue Tick Sauce and Carolina Swamp Sauce among others. I hadn't had it in several years until my sister gave me a jar of the thick Bone Suckin' Sauce a couple of months ago...heaven!!! Will have to try and find more when we go to NC in a couple of weeks and bring it back to PA."
0,Its not that great.,"I have owned this cassette player for 3 months now. For the price , it is decent if you also believe the short durability of all cassette players. MY rants: 1. Biggest complaint is that mega bass is more like puny bass. Liked my old Panasonic better. 2. The power button on the front easily turns on by accidental contact. Unless you pull out the batteries after every use, expect to waste alot of $ on batteries. 3. Although it hasn't broken for me YET, the battery door is cheap and looks very breakable; esp in light of pulling out batteries when not in use. 4. For some reason, my cassette player keeps shuttling forward to reverse playback when it is cold. When it warms up, it resumes its normal function. Must be averse to cold.Rave: 1.Price. Besides I had to use my Xmas certificate from last year before it expired."
1,Highly Underrated Movie,"So I guess I'm wierd, but I really liked this movie. The cinematic action sequences (even though performed by scantily clad women) were well choreagraphed, and digital effects were flawless (in a graphic-novel sort of rendering). The underlying message in the plot went well with the movie. Blu Ray features are worth the price. I got this last year at a blow-out christmas price, so I couldn't pass it up."
1,The Anne Kullberg Method Opened New Doors,"After reading the Kullberg book on colored pencil portraiture, I found myself enjoying my work more. I have sold portraits for years and years and have never had as much fun as I am now. The Kullberg method is so simple. Her work is beautiful. By using her methods my sales have increased 75%. I am so glad I discovered the Kullberg method. All of the years of formal art training did not teach me what I learned from this one book. Thanks Anne!"
0,Does not run on Mac OS X,"I bought this for my son because my older son has the I Spy and loves it. The I Spy runs perfect on Mac OS X. So I called Scholastic and they verified that it wouldn't run on anything later than OS 9. The error I get is ""You can't open the application I spy installer because the classic environment is no longer supported""So if you have a new Mac with leopard installed this won't work!"
1,Love it!,"Great quality video.Great sound.Small, light weight, & compact.No regrets in buying this item."
0,A one hour idea stretched to almost three hours,"I found this movie to be almost unwatchable. If your idea of a good time is watching Henry Gibson trying to sing while the camera takes long pans over dull crowd scenes, then this movie is for you. The three minutes of excitement near the end barely has anything to do with anything that preceeded it. Altman can pull off such greats as ""Mash"" and ""Godsford Park"" and then stink up the joint with this. What's up with that?"
0,Not as warm as other base layers,"I bought these because I have another pair of Hot Chilly's winter leggings that are more like stretch fleece, and that's what I thought these were. But they're not -- they're kind of like Spandex only thinner, and not warm at all. I live in Yosemite where it gets very cold at night and I went out in these like I did my others, but unlike the other leggings these left me very cold and sorry I spent $50 for them. Be sure you know what you're buying. Thank goodness I have a couple of pairs of silk base layers to wear. I'll stick to silk from now on!"
0,"ALEX PROYAS, OPUS 6","Was the director ofDark City (Director's Cut)really responsible for that ? Even in the worst American sci-fi B movies of the 50's, you can find better screenplays than this one. How do producers spend millions for such a mess ? A DVD zone garbage can. Instant crap."
0,Don't waste your money,"This item arrived in a damaged box. There were multiple missing parts once opened. The most obvious missing parts were the seats. There were no seats in the box. The instruction manual was for an excercise machine. I am an avid Amazon shopper and have bought many items through Amazon. This table, the condition it came in, has to be the worst thing I've ever purchased. Obviously I returned it, the return process was not so bad, but I am very disappointed that Amazon would send out such a defective product."
0,What a let down,The music was good. That is all I can find good to say about this game. The ending was very disappointing to me. What a let down. The game play itself was boring and dragged on .
0,Cathy's review,"I was very disappointed with this book. I hate reading a book and having questions about what happened to the characters at the end. The author had way too many things going on in this book. It is almost as if he wanted to included every idea he has ever had in his life in one book. Additionally, the verse was way too poetic. The subject matter was not beautiful, so it was unneccessary to use the imagery that he did. In my opinion, there were just too many things going on in this book and its a shame that they went unresolved. This book would have been just as good if it was half the length."
0,RED SCARE!!!,"This movie conceals Wells's atheistic socialistic and utopic views with religious fervor of prayer. The book is not meant to show that God is merciful and will bring miracles. The book was meant to show that society is corrupt and the only way for a utopia to be built is if the current civilization be destroyed in its entirety. The book is the journey of one man not a Adam/Eve couple. This man thought he was one of the few who survived and created his own utopia out of one of the ruined suburbs outside of London. WARNING to the ignorant viewer, this movie is not a true depiction of the book it is nothing but a mask! Beware of the times, beware of the RED SCARE!"
1,Worth the money,"This towel fit the mat perfectly. It did bunch a little during a Bikram Yoga class, but it is MUCH better than the beach towel I had been using. It washes well and hang dries in about 5 hours (I did not put it in the dryer). It does not prevent slipping as well as the towels with raised designs, but then it does not cost as much."
0,Watch porn instead,Save yourself some money and watch some pornographic videos instead. What you'll find:-Some of these positions aren't possible unless you are circus people-Some of these positions aren't possible unless you are Rambo with a 90 pound girlfriend-Tons of the positions look like EXACT copies of one anotherAll in all I would say a waste of money.
0,What is this???,"Wow, what is this world coming to!! This guy needs a shink. So what if a girl screwed him, it happens all the time. He should get over it and not tell me about it because, to tell the truth, I really do not care. And calling girls hoes, sorry, it doesn't cut it. He should look at himself first because, like it or not, men are bigger hoes then women and that is a fact. It's real life, get over it. I don't hate, I look at real facts and tell it like it is. And wheater you like it or not, rap sounds the same all around, it's not a joke. All they rap about is how women screwed them or how women should be treated. If that is not an insult, I don't know what is. They should rap about something that is important in life not about the same sh*t over and over again. It's boring and not realistic. Maybe a woman rapper should rap in the same way about guys."
1,"Wrong Thing, but Excepted it Anyway.","Even though I love ""Ozzie and Harriet"" I was dissappointed because the seller sent me the wrong one, but since I like it so much I'll keep it, and It came promptly."
0,Just OK,"Got the CD for one song and that is really the only one I enjoy. The rest are OK, but just OK."
0,Did a ghost writer write this?,I've read everyone of Martha Grimes Richard Jury mysteries and enjoyed them. The rich dialog and description. This one has none of that. In fact the dialog between Melrose and Jury in the first chapter sounded like a beginning writer's attempt at pithy dialog. I'm about half way through and keep wondering if this book was ghost written. It is truly terrible. These great characters deserve better.
1,GOOD CD TO BE HIS FIRST,WELL I LOVE KORN AND I LOVE ALL DIFFERENT KIND OF MUSIC. AND HONESTLY FIELDY'S LYRICS HAS SOME MEANING TO IT. I SAY HES BETTER RAPPIN THAN MOST RAPPERS KNOW A DAYS. INSTEAD OF COMPLAINING ABOUT FIELDY WHY DONT YALL COMPLAIN ABOUT HEAD WHO LEFT KORN:)
1,Good movie,This is a fun movie to watch. It takes me back to my high school years. I like the music that is played in the movie.
1,"Dreamy, beautiful!","Air are a French electro-pop duo and this album is an excellent showcase of their immense talents. Their style is dreamy and relaxing.'Cherry blossom girl' is a tender beautiful number with light airy vocals. 'Universal traveller' is another lilting, gentle number, faintly reminiscent of Michael Franks. 'Biological' is a slow, creepy number with half spoken lyrics.The highlight for me are two instrumental numbers; 'Alone in Kyoto', and the brilliant, catchy, 'Alpha beta gaga' with it's whistles, beeps, and lush electronics.If you like this cd, try 'Melody AM by Röyksopp."
0,"Slow, Ponderous Plus Change to Daughter Unsuccessful","This is a Wallander mystery but the WRONG Wallander. It is an attempt to shift the main character from the aging Kurt, star of all the other books, to his daughter Linda. Linda is not an interesting character. She is now thiry and starting out at Kurt's station herself. She is worried because a friend of hers, Anna, has seemingly disappeared. While trying to find Anna, she and her father wander into a hut which has the severed hands and head of another woman. This should ratchet up the pace and action of the book but it does not.There is a tremendous amount of interior dialogue in this novel. When it is Kurt having this soliloquies, it is ok. When it is Linda, it is boring. The dialogue in this book is the weakest aspect of the book with the leaden pace coming a close second. I can't recommend this book. The author is taking a step in the wrong direction with Linda as the lead character."
0,What a jip!,"I recently bought this book for my baby because he had played with a friend's book and loved the spider page. Well, when we opened up the new book, low and behold, there is no spider page! It seems that this book doesn't have two of the character's that the older version has! Amazon needs to update their website and Priddy Books needs to go back to the original! Please be aware that your book may not match the book online!"
1,The best,"... Skinhead Street Gangs is the most complete book on the subject. In his new book, Gangbangers, Christensen writes more on all factions of skinheads. Both books are excellent and I recommend them to cops, parents and others who work or live around gangs."
0,Horrible,This has got to be one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. Don't bother watching it or wasting your time. It seems anything that Cage has been in within the last few years has been pretty horrible with a couple exceptions.
1,Is Olivia Being True To Herself?,"Olivia has always had strong ethics and values but when Morgan decides that they are best friends,she is not always true to herself.Rachel Vail has created another masterpeice in addition to the well read ""If You Only Knew"",""Please,Please,Please"" and ""Not That I Care"".This book will keep you in suspense as you anxiously await to hear how she works things out with Morgan,CJ,Zoe,Lou and many other people."
0,Should be less than one star,"Really, there is nothing to this cd. nothing creative about it or original. your crazy if you think this is a come back"
0,Save your money,"Download ""Father and Daughter"" and you'll have the only worthwhile track on the album. The rest of it is pure garbage."
1,"Hangin Ten With ""The Monk""","Natalie Teeger knows her vacation is already over but she tries to enjoy it and encourages Adrian Monk to enjoy it as well. But can you imagine Adrian Monk in Hawaii in his suit while everyone around him is nakedish? Can you imagine him at all in Hawaii? I couldn't until I read this book.""Mr. Monk Goes to Hawaii"" is Lee Goldberg's second of his ""Monk"" series. Personally I'll probably never go to Hawaii but thanks to Lee's book I've been taken there with Adrian Monk! This trip you can't miss! It's an humerous journey of mystery and adventure that you'll experience through Natalie Teeger's eyes and one you won't forget. One can feel the warm tropical magic of Hawaii blowing across the characters and through the whole story right off the pages to the reader.Lee Goldberg did a great job and I would quickly recommend this book to anyone."
0,Heavy-handed Style vs. Content - who ya got?,"This book was a major disappointment. The author seems to be trying so hard to write with a snarky, mega-cool style that he forgets what he's writing about and just jags off to the rhythm of his words. This gets very tedious after a while. If you really want to read about survival, get any book by Jon Krakauer."
1,DO NO BUY IT ON EBAY FOR $84.14 and get ripped off.,If you want to get ripped off buy it there. I have not bought it yet but I probably will and this is where I will. People buy it here and then resell it on Ebay.
0,J.W.I. PhantoM's Pokemon Ruby & Sapphire Version Strategy Guide Review,"Honestly, since they are given the information of the game, this guide should have been a lot better. The best quality about the strategy guide is the berry guide, the stats of the Pokemon, and that it suggests that you should start off with a Torchic.It does not show hidden item locations, not to mention it clusters what you can do from the beginning with what you can do after you obtain cut and such like that. It doesn't give you levels of Pokemon in the wilderness, you don't really get told about how much money you'll get from battles or what Pokemon which trainer uses.Overall, I personally think you should get an emulator and play through the game with every last detail, and make your own strategy guide, it'd be more resourceful and with the print screen button you might actually get somewhere with getting every last hidden treasure that's waiting to be found.J.W.I. PhantoM"
1,"Clip Art,More,and Even More Clip Art for the Liturgical year","I have used the liturgical clip art books from Liturgical Press for more than ten years. They are fabulous, clear, and cover a broad range of seasonal liturgical needs. The art items are presented in a variety of combinations and sizes, so if you don't have a copier that reduces, it helps. These volumes and also those by Placid Stuckenschneider are among th best any where commercially available.Ken Suetterlin, central Iowa U.M. Pastor"
0,Simply Horrible,"The author spends paragraphs, pages, and chapters on ideas that could be expressed clearly in one or two sentences. The author's prose reminds me of a speaker who is in love with the sound of his own voice and goes on and on and on and on....There are plenty of better books on writing out there; avoid this one."
0,I was expecting something of value,"I was extremely disappointed being a 1 month old mariner. I expected to visually learn much from this dvd, but it was so basic I cannot believe anyone would consider this value for money. Most of the video was hold to dock with wind coming from different directions.. my advice is buy a book and read all about this in about 10 mins and save money and 50 mins of your life."
1,THE BEST BOOK EVER!,"This book was so amazing. David is a normal kid trying to fit in with the popular kids, and when he helps an operation to take Mrs. Bayfield's cane, he flips her off and gets cursed... Or does he? After that David loses his old friends but gains a bunch of new ones that remind everyone of the three stooges. To top that, things like his pants falling down while asking someone out, or his zipper being down when he walks into class happen to him. I couldn't put this book down. My mom usually reads the same books I read if I say they are good, and she loved it too. I had read Holes not that long ago, and thought it was great, but this book is one million times better. I really suggest that people read this."
1,For everyone who wants to learn the truth about Voodoo.,"I loved the fact that Teish put this book in the context of returning home and telling her personal story of coming to Voodoo. As a black woman who is drawn to many Pagan paths but especially looking for something that reflects my ancestry, this book really reverberated with me. Teish includes everything from the beginnings of Voodoo in W. African and its development in America, to altars for specific Gods, humorous anecdotes, spells for many purposes, etc. etc. etc. A much-overlooked but much-needed addition to any Pagan library."
1,Great food mat for my kitty.,I needed a durable mat to place my cats food dish and have been delighted with this one. It cleans up easily and was very reasonably priced.
0,Okay,"An okay film. Tries too hard to be funny at times. Some gross out gags don't help much. When I first saw it, I thought the film was really funny, but that was probably due to taking an Ambien."
0,Jennifer Garner Looks Hot,"And.... that's the best thing about this movie. Jennifer Garner, who I love to watch kicking butt in Alias, looks really sexy and fierce as the mega-butt-kicking Elektra. Other than that, the story is too full of flashbacks (which are not informative if you have not seen the ultra-lame DareDevil) and has plot holes you can drive a truck through."
0,Nostaliga only-poor transfer,The mp3 download offered here is from an LP record in bad condition. The first two tracks even skip!Didn't anyone listen to this before uploading.Aside from that it's ok.
1,Look great,"It is amazing how many people drive nice cars, but have marred them with horrible looking license plate mounting jobs. It is so easy to do it well. Buy a set of these thin, black frames. (Note - check your license plate brackets first to make sure you can use frames with them. Especially the front plate.) Then use *four* *black* screws to screw them in. Align the screw slots for that final obsessive-compulsive touch.I like these Cruiser frames because they are extremely thin, made of metal, and have a nice black finish that will last a long time. They fit where other frames won't. I knocked one star off the review because, as others have noted, they could have been a mm or two taller. As it is though, when you tighten them down, things will flatten slightly and the plate edges should just tuck inside. If not, make sure the excess sticks out the bottom so no one will notice."
0,"Could have been useful, BUT ...","Pros: Light-weight, high-quality and magnifies 2X.However, if you have bad eyesight, 2X won't be enuf. It would've been more useful had it been 3X and longer.Another reason for me to get a KINDLE ... I could at least, change the FONT SIZE and that would solve my problem.:>("
1,Ignorance or Intelligence,"Intelligence is not the result of pumping facts into ones brain. Rather, intelligence is the ability to reason and recognize opinions as well as argue another opinion. The art of learning requires that one learn the basic facts of knowledge and then learn to apply knowledge in the art of reason. This is intelligence.Dorothy Sayers classic treatise on learning is one to inspire homeschoolers and Classical Education proponents alike. Another tremendous work that parallels this work is ""The Mind of the Maker."" Sayers expands the ideas of intelligence to accompany the mind of our Maker."
1,Road to Prosperity,"I read the book and also listened to the cd's in my car. Talk about breakthroughs. The book flows very well and by the time you get not even half-way through you'll have your lightbulb moment. Take advantage of the great gift that Eker gives the ""Millionaire Mind Intensive"" Seminar. Without a doubt I would have paid full price for the seminar."
0,bad book,"First of all, I love Jimmy Buffett. I've been to a bunch of concerts, and I am a big Parrot Head. But Jimmy Is a lousy writer. I mean, his writing skills are simply terrible. I felt like I was reading a book written by a 12 year old. Not only that, but the story line is terrible. I know other Parrot heads will tear me apart over this review, but honestly the man can't write. Sorry Jimmy and friends."
1,"Great CD, lots of songs and all of them good.","The CD is great- the Shangri-Las show their talent to the fullest with the variety of songs they perform. Beside their big hits they sing a lot of different style songs that you might not think they could sing and sound good at, but they do a great job on all the songs on the CD and there's not a lot of groups that can do that. Well worth the money and a good CD for anyone's collection."
0,It could have been great,"Of all the ways not to learn a language, this is probably the most irritating. The verbs are read in a ceaseless monotone, out of context. In a nutshell, this is how no one speaks Spanish. It's like trying to learn a language by having someone who is very bored read you a dictionary. What a disappointment, because the concept is good and with only a modicum of imagination the results should have been great. Instead of bajo, bajas, baja, what if the verbs had been put in context? I'm going down the stairs? Did you go down to the river? etc. What if the basic sounds had been demonstrated? When you hear ...ere'or era, you know it's the future tense, when you hear ...ia, you know it's the past. Save your money!"
0,Poor quality,"The first one I ordered was damage in shipment, so I reordered and received one in good condition. Afer 30 days the interior light stopped working. I have found the sensor cook is not consistant. I do not recommend this product"
1,After Midnight,"I enjoyed reading this series. I am usually not into vampire stories outside of Sookie Stackhouse, but I wanted to try a historical romance version. I was not let down with After Midnight. I truly enjoyed getting lost in Teresa Medeiros's world."
0,Terrible!!,"This is the worst book on Stanford that I have ever seen. The pictures are small and faded . . . I have photos taken in 1975 with a cheap camera that look better than what you'll find here. (Ah, but the cover pic looks awfully nice, you might think. Yes, it does. Fine bit of hucksterism from Princeton Architectural Press.)"
1,Endearing,"This story has everything! Comedy, compromise, characters that everyone can relate to, and an all over ""leave you with a really good feeling"" after you've read it."
1,The best musical in the world!,"Andrew Lloyd Weber and Tim Rice are amazing! I have listened to this ten million times in five different recordings and I love them all! This particular recording's strong points are that it has Ted Neely, my favorite for Jesus, and Carl Anderson, my favorite for Judas. It also has ""Could We Start Again, Please?"" and ""Then We Are Decided"" which are only on the soundtrack recording. Joshua Mostel isn't the best singer as King Herod and the sound gets kind of funny during the 40 lashes though. If I were you, I would buy this soundtrack recording and the original broadway cast recording (I have both). That way you get the good parts from both. I hope you love it as much as I do!"
1,FInally,"Amazing series. You will cry during this series, it is so sad. The soundtrack fits in so well and you wil fall in love with the characters. This series was basically unavailable for a long time, and if you could find it, it would cost you an arm and a leg, but now its 30 bucks. Buy it now!"
1,WHY WOULD YOU PAY FOR THIS,"This is available FOR FREE on the White wolf website. Go to the site click on Scion, then find the demo!(EDIT) White Wolf has moved many of its PDFs to Drivethrurpg.com"
0,The Doctor's Mimic,"Right off the bat how do you name your album after someone who is not apart of it. But then again he couldn't name it anything else cause Dr. Dre is all he talks about and he pretty much just uses Dre's flow. I had to go back and listen the The Documentry to remember what what Game really sounds like. This man's rhyme book pretty much consist of Dr. Dre, West Coast, G Unit and 64 Impalas. He does so much name droppin it sounds like his reading out of a phonebook. this album is mediocre, it comes no where near the The Documentry. Big dissappoinment, not worth half the hype."
1,Great way to get started practicing the Law...,"This was a workbook type version that helps you put one foot in front of the other with getting started with the Law of Attraction. It's easy to read, but teaches in a way that is a bit different from the Secret... mixes it up a bit."
0,This is not a happy ending !,I can't believe that I am taking time to write an online review about this cd ! Absolutely boring from the beginning till the end.This is not Genesis and that's all ! It is a bad way to end the story ..
0,Not the Ataris that I grew to love,"Seeing all these flawless reviews sparked my need to write a review. While the Ataris are a band that I respect a lot, this cd is what I hoped it wouldn't be. Now in my opinion, they didn't ""sell out"" when they went to the major label. They have been slowly going to a slower more emo-ish sound, and that's fine. But for any die-hard fans of ""Blue Skies"" this is nothing like that cd. This is by far their slowest album and the tunes aren't as catchy as in past efforts. The Ataris have stayed true and haven't tried to appeal to the MTV audience even though they do have a video, but why not if you have the means to do so? Focusing strictly on the music, this is not my favorite kind of music, but it is decent. I wished they went back to their old style of punk though. This is one band that I wish hadn't grown up."
0,Whats in it for me Christianity,"What he teaches is a ""what can God do for me?"" Christianity, when in fact the opposite should be our attitude: What can I do for You Lord? God didn't put us on this earth to see what kind of a wonderful life we could make for ourselves, but simply to serve Him. I gave it 2 stars because the chapter on giving is wonderful."
0,AWFUL!!!!,"This product was not easy to use. The car seat was very difficult to snap into the stroller. It didn't even latch properly in the stroller position. Worst of all, the car seat was terrible to install. The narrow base wobbled back and forth, and eventually the straps on the base broke off! This product was frustrating to use. The Chicco travel system is much safer and easier to use. I do not recommend buying the Eddie Bauer model!"
1,Sunny Randall - Girl Detective,"Sunny Randall goes for the underdog again. Not a bad thing but she doesn't get paid enough for this crap. Anyway Sunny is hired to learn the real past of a very troubled young woman. Her parents are not forth coming in the most simple information. After she hires Sunny she's attacked and told to let it drop. Sunny is also confronted about letting the matter drop, with a much different outcome. Now Sunny is going to uncover what's going on, no matter what. A few twists and turns but you figure out who the bad guys are pretty quick. They should make a movie about Sunny Randall the way they did about Jessie Stone."
1,Two Books in One,As a preaching minister I have found myself going to Robert Blair's book numerous times for help and suggestions in ministering in two of the most emotional times in a person's life -- marriage and death. I would highly recommend this book to any one who is involved in these area's on peoples lives. You will keep it close for quick reference.
1,Can I go too?,"The adventures, people and locations Nana experiences on her trips makes me want to go too! The illustrations are beautifully done and imaginatively laid out. This is not your average children's book! My kids were facinated by the different places Nana travels to and I loved the maps showing their locations. This book is a great addition any child's library. Grandparents need a copy too!"
1,One of FT's best,"This is one of FT's best albums, second only to ""Don't Crush That Dwarf, Hand me the Pliers."" Very much worth listening to repeatedly (all their albums stand up to multiple playings; there is a lot going on in all of them)."
0,unnecessary satan stuff....,"I have to agree with several of the latest reviews of this book. I read the ""Forever King"" in a book club earlier this year and enjoyed the creative take on the Author legend, so decided to borrow the sequel for some fun summer reading! I had to finish just for my piece of mind after the disturbing and unnecessary satanic ritual scenes. Too much emphasis on evil, and not enough on the special qualities of Author(?)if any... I have also read many different takes on the Authorian legends like a previous reviewer and my personal favorite is ""Mists of Avalon"", by Marion Zimmer Bradley. Try that one."
1,"The Next Step - Not for Beginners, but Good!","Teneriffe patterns, knot start, fitting a lid, fancy stitches, caning, two-part handles, and projects using these techniques. Illustrated with drawings and photos of finished projects. Also, construction of wire shapes and outlines for teaching. Not basic coiling information, for experienced coilers."
0,Complete JUNK,"Cable did not support EDID so it would not support 1920x1080 resolution that I need. Item did not match pictures or description. NO ferrites, 14pins not 15, and does not support ""high resolution monitors and high quality signal transmission"" as claimed in the description."
1,The Bean Trees,This book was written some years ago but speaks to the modern day world. Most young people look to the day when they will go off on their own to see what life holds for them. Most would probably not take on the responsibilities the young woman in this book shoulders nor have the compassion for others.
0,You only get some of the stuff shown on the picture,Received the cooler - it works fine.Couple things to watch out for - no manual in the box.That is odd - toothbrush comes with one..AC adapter - shown on the web site - not in the box.There is word 'optional' on the box near the picture.No phone number or any other indication on how to order it.Not the best shopping experience.
0,Ugly,"This hat is really really ugly and does not look like how it does in the picture. The front of it is way too tall, it looks like its meant for someone with a really tall deformed head..."
0,Skip this one,"The recordings Can made following the departure of founding member Holger Czukay (such as this one) were consistently weak and uninteresting compared to the phenomenal output the group made in the 1960's and '70's. The albums _Ege Bamyasi_, _Tago Mago_ and _Monster Movie_ are strong and inspired and won't disappoint. _Out of Reach_ will."
0,"Poor battery life, no on/off switch,weak magnets",I got this for Christmas and it's only January and the batteries already need to be replaced.There is no on/off switch so the timer is always on reducing battery life or maybe the batteries were marginal when I bought it.Replacement batteries cost more than the timer.Magnets don't hold timer very well.
0,Exceedingly mediocre....,"This is not by any means a collection of the BEST. There are a few classics, but not nearly enough. This is largely a tribute to the later years.A best-of collection simply must be more comprehensive, from the entire history of SNL, especially when the show had meaningful political satire and biting social commentary.In this collection, there are WAY too many parodies that are just juvenile, or at best adolescent. The best parodies were fine for almost all ages because they were quality. Aside from many being in bad taste, most of these just aren't funny."
0,The bedroom Business,l dont write that many review but if you are like me just buy so many books a week then l will tell you l didnt like this book it had me read the first two chapters then the middle then the end it just didnt keep me entertain. The story just wasnt that real....
1,Do you believe in god? You will.,"This book made me - a firm athiest- a believer in the existence of God. It presents people from all walks of life, in all circumstances, talking to ""the Listener"", and coming away renewed with hope, no matter how hopeless their circumstances. It was one of the most moving books I have ever read"
0,use free ebay instead of buying this book,"If I had not gone on ebays free and comprehensive and easy to understand audio and written sites, I would have thought this was good, even though rather terse. Ebay is a better way to go for free and is MUCH more detailed and MUCH more comprehensive."
0,Fire in the hole!,In my experience with this product it is just a hot poke in the nose. Did not clear my sinuses at all. Just burned like the dickens for a minute or so.
1,Spider-wow!,"Tobey McGuire plays Peter Parker...a teenager bitten by a genetically altered spider and becomes Spiderman. Great SFX, AWESOME soundtrack, good plot...could've done without the unrequited love scenes. William DeFoe plays the Green Goblin who discovers Peter's secret and tries to destroy him & the ones he loves."
1,Amazing Amazing Amazing,"Redeeming Love is by far the best book I have ever read. I couldn't put it down from the moment I started reading. It changed the way i think about myself and other people. it is so beautiful to think that God looks on us the Michael Hosea looked upon Angel, with forgiveness, compassion, love, and patience. I would totally recomend this book to everyone who would take the time to read it."
1,"Not ""Non-Stick""","I bought this pan to replace an non-stick pan I use for sauteing, not the best idea. I didn't realize this pan doesn't have the non-stick coating that I was use to with my other Calphalon frying pan, and had significant sticking the first few times cooking in this pan. You have to use more oil than with a non-stick pan. The size is okay, the actual flat surface(bottom) of the pan is smaller(8.5"") than I would have liked. The sides do slope up and out quite a bit, therefore it is deeper than a regular frying pan. This pan would work better for braising or low-temp. cooking in my opinion. Even though without the non-stick coating to worry about at higher temperatures, the amount of oil needed for browning is a lot for me."
1,Them HOTT BOYS!!!!!!,"Anyone out there who don't like them are Crazy! Their cd is da bomb and so are they.I love the song ""God must spent a little more time on you"" It is enchanting and cool! I also like ""tearing up my heart"" that is my favorit. All the people of the world, know this, they rule!!!"
0,This is Not what you think!!,"Be careful when ordering this release. If you have the original release, then that is really all you need. I was under the impression that the 8 bonus tracks were part of this concert?? If they are, the crowd noise has been edited away so it takes away the flavor of the ""concert"" sound and causes one to question their legitimacy. Those 8 bonus tracks also lack the energy of the show at hand? The last track on disc 2 is an obnoxious and goofy, different version of Johnny Q which I have heard somewhere else before and so is not part of the show. I will have to investigate on which of my 8's albums that track comes from. If your curious, do not pay full price for this one. Thank goodness I got mine used!"
0,O.K song but.......,"As a teenage girl lindsays age i can honestly say this song would of been more suited to someone about 15 or 16 in that rebellious teen phase.The beat is really catchy though...but one of the things i dont like about the lyrics is she is complaining about being in the spotlight.Please girl if you think your life is hard try living a day with no food,water all those things you are talking about in ""rumours"" (having a good time,having fun,steppin' into the club)and if you dont like the sort of lifestyle fame brings then quit bicthing and acting like a hoe in yor film clip."
1,Voodoo Charms and Talismans,"This book was informative, although sometimes a bit elementary. It did however give easy to follow instructions and lore."
1,No Issues,"I'm using this in a very old HP 3030 all-in-one with no issues. Cheaper than the brand-name, and working well."
1,Very Worthwhile,My husband and I both really enjoyed the dvd. We are definitely going to implement what we have learned and are really looking forward to it. I would say watching this is very worthwhile and I recommend it to anyone. I didn't give 5 stars only because I felt they didn't stress the action one should take enough in order to reach goals. I am going to get the book which I believe does touch more on that.
0,Chinese QA strikes again,"I hate to downgrade Merrell as they make great shoes, this being my 4th pair. Tried these on locally and then ordered through Amazon, the 11.5 D(M), I noticed right away the right shoe was more narrow then the left. When I took the insoles out, the right insole had more of an upward curve where the shoe is more narrow. So now my left foot is comfortable and my right one is hanging off the side...Checked and they're both the same size. Oh well, other than that the shoes are nice. Now I am stuck paying twice the shipping and wondering whether or not to reorder or get something else.I wouldn't care too much about quality assurance either if I was being payed 50 cents an hour."
0,This book is a waste of time and money,"Bland, slow-moving plot, and the author spends more time on the main character's alcoholism than on the weak murder mystery. Ugh... Save your money."
0,Horses Never Lie by Mark Rashid,"This book should be titled "" Horses never Lie, only old Cowboys""There is useful information but the author is long winded and his stories are leaning toward the fanastic."
0,Not received the item as promised by Sep30th 2011,"I have not recieved ""Zen Meditation Balls (Miniature Editions)"" as promised by 30th Sep 2011. There is no tracking information. What are my available options ?"
1,Multi star multitap,Great accessorie. Very good for those four player shooters. Works great with madden 2001 and timesplitters. I highly recomend this item for any serious gamer.
1,Good investment,"I am very pleased with this instrument. Not being a flutist, I was not looking forward to renting something, that may not be in that great of condition, for my 10 year old daughter to begin music lessons. It was tuned a little sharp as received, but easily fixed by not inserting the head joint all the way. Even so, I'm sure nobody listening to her elementary school band, except maybe her music teacher, would notice."
1,Great value for $,"I have gone thru 2 of the original Cybersonic toothbrushes in the last 5 or 6 years. This product does a tremendous job at cleaning my teeth. It is also excellent at flossing, although I am not consistant at using the flossing function, when I do both flossing and brushing with the Cybersonic, my teeth feel like I just came from the dentist for a cleaning! The only downside to this product is that the battery slowly degrades and eventually does not hold much of a charge. I am hoping that the Cybersonic2 is better in this respect."
1,Amusing Lightweight Thriller,Austin accountant Jack Grant goes to Los Angeles for a vacation and does a rich client a favor by looking in on her niece and the niece's new boyfriend. And the more he investigates the boyfriend the more trouble he encounters. Ultimately he walks into a trap and has to figure a way out.The novel is funny and well-paced. A steady diet of witty dialogue and a Beverly Hills setting make the book a good choice for an afternoon at the beach.
1,Love it!,"I upgraded to this from a cheap metal 1940's-style can opener, so this this is instantly amazing! I love the locking feature, the soft grip handle, and the easy to turn nob. This has made opening cans so easy. Love it!"
1,Works Great !,"I have used it for only about 1 week with a Razr Phone, connects easy works well ,, the only thing I did not think of is Phone battery life while using bluetooth ,, they seem to go fast , but no problem so far ,I do wish the range was better , but you learn how far you can go from your phone ,the voice pick up is very good as I tend to talk low and my friends still here me fine even in my old loud VW,, so if your looking for a good head set for you razr and you on a budget like me ,, this one is great ,"
0,Reads like a high school English project,"""The Greatest Generation"" reminds me of biographies printed for class reunions or interviews published in a small town newspaper. In ""The Greatest Generation"" Tom Brokaw profiles dozens of people who served their country during World War II.Most of the profiles follow the template of: X did this during the war, X had this memory of the war, X married Y and they had these children, the war changed X in this manner, this is how X's family think the war influenced X, this is why X's friend or co-worker thinks X is a great person, and this is what X thinks of the generations to follow.Using this formula made it easy for Brokaw to do three to ten page bios on the people he met. The profiles all seem generic after awhile. The book packs very little emotional impact perhaps because it is written in an overly sentimental manner. There are very few interesting stories or anecdotes for a book that goes over 400 pages.I expected something better from Tom Brokaw."
1,Allows for clean install.,This really does a nice job of allowing for a clean install. Hooking my Sportster 5 direct to the head unit versus the built in FM wireless provided for much better sound. You get more than you need in the kit to cover many options and installs and for that reason it might be a little overpriced but well worth it for a cleaner look.
1,Great for Quick Fix,I use this product because I have 2 cats. It is great for quick fixes when I just don't have the time (or energy) to get out the carpet cleaner.
1,A Leader and A Writer,"This is a very good read - a good story by a good writer(a Marine officer with a B.A. in classics). Based on his story and writing I'd follow this man, this officer into battle. This book should be considered a companion read of GENERATION KILL by Evan Wright. Mr. Wright was an embedded reporter with Captain Fick's Marines. Read both books, not just one or the other. BOTH."
0,"Price gouging, BIGTIME. A real shame","Five-star product gets one star for the worst price gouging I've ever encountered-I bought this product here in July 2009 for $49 shipped. Went to this page in November 2009 to refer a friend and see that now the price is >>>>$170.00<<< shipped.If anyone is willing to put up with this price gouging (the Midas got a positive review on Cooltools and this fact apparently went to some peoples' heads), be warned that the recipe book is rife with errors: I had to email the factory to learn that the 'gelato' recipes are all fatally flawed*.A shame overall: the Midas makes wonderful ice cream once the recipe is corrected, but not for that kind of money.* The correction: one cup of cream gets heated. The 2nd cup is whipped and added later after the base cools for half an hour. They also specify heavy cream: IMHO light cream actually produces a better, non-greasy product."
0,This Rack Doesn't Stack Up to The Wind,"When I viewed this rack on the web I thought maybe the 16g steel would be thick enough to hold 1/2 cord of wood upright during a PA winter. When the package arrived, I took one look at the un-open box and shipped it right back.Folks, let's get real here. If you're going to store a 1/2 cord of wood outside, during the winding winter months, heavy spring rains this product is not for you. If you are going to store a 1/2 cord of wood in the garage or near a wall, fence on a level floor that can block the wind from tipping this rack over, then buy this rack.The issue is balance, or should I say lack of balance.Needless to say, you get what you pay for. I decided to go with the 1/2 cord Woodhaven rack. For $200, I got piece of mind that I would not wake up one morning and find my stack logs tipped over.Life is too short."
1,Fun! Like an old gossip magazine.,"I'd owned this book when I was young and always remembered it. It was exactly as I remembered it. Fun to look at, lots of pictures and pretty factual."
1,"great, my kid loves it",my kid loves it so far bought 5 or 6 of these products from papo. the ones with the moving jaw are nice. this one does not have i think but not sure.
1,Look at what the U.S. is missing out on!,"I don't know much about this mysterios singer Elisha La'verne, but all I can say is ""LOOK AT WHAT THE U.S.IS MISSING OUT ON!"" Why can'tsome of these import artists(such as Hill St. Soul,Beverlei Brown,Dennis Taylor,Rhona, and Elisha La'verne) do atleast 1 album in the U.S.! It's like most of the import R&B artists are even better than the R&B U.S. singers!"
1,Mom loved her wagon,"Mom loved her wagon, able to use it for yard work at 83. could have used a better paint job."
0,Terrible Band and worst cover,"Other bands have performed covers of Joy Division and most were pretty bad. The cover that fallout boy made of Love Will Tear us Apart is just plain crappy. The singing just sucks (for any songs by fallout boy), not even close to being as good as the original. The cover is a disgrace to Ian. If you want a good version hear the original."
1,Does the Job...,"A nice looking cottonball/cotton swab holder. The knob on top is small making it a little hard to get a good grasp in order to lift the lid off, but it's a minor issue."
0,no reason,I don't know why Dre recruited this kid and produce his cd.He's getting crazy.I want the Dre that sing with Snoop and produce good artists and make classic hits like Nuthin But a G thang and The Next Episode.This boy ain't no gangsta.He said that this was the story of his life and what a bad life.He can't think.Stay on the ghetto boy cuz' Im in here and I sing better than you.The only ones that are making good rap are Kanye West and a few more and Snoop is making the gangsta rap because the others are just commercial music like this cd where you see guys that watch MTV and are home n*ggas giving this cd 5 stars just because they saw the video at mtv.Game you can't think.All that you done has been done before.
0,Didn't like it!!,"I didn't like this show. I gave it a chance by watching season one but for me something still was missing from the story line that didn't quite satisfy me. I like the concept of Fairy Tale characters living in two worlds but the writing was lacking and didn't pull me in. On top of that the evil Queen was way over the top with her role, making the supporting cast invisible. I wasn't interested in season two, one was enough."
0,Not that great,I bought these because Cooks Illustrated gave them a very positive review. I bought several pairs figuring I could give them as stocking stuffers to my adult children who all are fairly serious cooks. I tried them and they were mediocre at best. They weren't sharp and it was difficult to cut even boneless chicken breasts with them. It was like the scissors were gumming the meat. I returned all but the pair I used. I have others from Chicago Cutlery (which also come apart for cleaning) which seem to be much stronger and sharper.
1,So hard to find a flavorful decaf. . .,"but here it is. With Prime shipping and Subscribe and Save, we simply cannot get a better price. We make our tea with a coffee maker and then make iced tea from that. The decaf chai provides a kick of flavor with our regular decaf bags."
1,Quick to ship,Not as good as Reichs. Storyline is like the show so I was a little confused as I didn't realize all the changes from original character.
0,Dead at 7 Weeks,"Do I like the product? Yes...if it would work. After seven weeks, the entire thing came to a grinding halt...poof! This would be only somewhat more amusing if the last Ipaq I owned, a 3630, had not had the screen go out when it was less than a month old. Compaq was nice enough not only to charge me $125.00 to repair it, but to erase the memory(not sure what that had to do with repairing the screen) and take nearly a month to return it to me. It took almost twenty phone calls and letter to the CEO of Compaq to get it returned. One other note. It does not come with a protective case which you MUST have. Add $25.00-$40.00 to the cost for this. It also does not come with a cradle. Add more for that. As a would-be purchaser, I would be leery of cheap manufacturing and terrible customer service."

1,A Courageous Memoir About Battling Depression,"William Styron is a great writer. Most readers and movie-goers are familiar with his book 'Sophie's Choice'. Most readers, however, are not familiar with the fact that William Styron had been battling with depression for most of his life.This book is only 80 pages long but it is very deep. It deals with Mr. Styron's battle with depression. It discusses his self-medicating with alcohol. He also uses prescription medication to combat his depression related insomnia (ambien). The sleeping pills made his depression even worse. He faces a despair so profound that he is unable to motivate himself to attend an event where he is to be presented with a prestigious literary award.For anyone who has suffered depression, who has a loved one or friend with depression, or for anyone interested in what depression is, this book will is highly recommended."
1,More Sulu,"I waited and waited for Season three to come out. Why? Because it has the episode where Sulu is fighting with his shirt off. This was groundbreaking. It was the first time the American public was able to realize how sexy the Japanese culture really is. Nowadays, you have teenagers with numerous Japanese writings on their shirts and many people getting tattoos with Japanese characters. For instance, my friend went to a tattoo parlor a few years ago and got into the trend. He saw a cool looking set of Japanese characters and told the tattoo artist to put it on his bicep. My friend had no idea what it meant until a waiter at a sushi restaurant translated the characters for him. Turns out he had the words, ""Turtle Wax"" in Japanese on his bicep. Anyway Sulu is a Japanese icon. His contribution and acting skills to the science-fiction community has made me make peace with the Japanese for bombing Pearl Harbor. I believe we are now official square."
1,an eye opener,"An eye opener for who is looking for clarity in some behavioural, emotional or repetitive problems. Only by realizing that there are more aspects in our lives that we can beter understand and feel, we step into another level of self realization. Thank you for this opportunity."
0,Pooh,I really didn't care for this book. The premise of the end of the world was enticing but the 'threesome' factor was over the top for me. I truly hate to be negative about any writer of lesbian fiction but this author has too much talent to waste it on detailing all the permutations of a triangle of lesbian sex.To be fair the summary stated the threesome factor but I bought it anyway hoping the 'end of the world' portion would prevail.Save your money and read Kim Baldwin's Hunter's Pursuit instead (or any Karin Kallmaker novel.)**Remember - if you want your favorite authors to keep writing for us they have to be able to earn a living doing it. Always buy a NEW book. I know it sucks but if you're not going to keep it in your collection recycle it.**

1,The Boy loves this Ball!,"Sparkles is a 8 year old Oneofakind LabPit who wears a Black tuxedo everywhere he goes. He got this ball for his 'mom's' birthday and he's thrilled to nose it and control it around the yard. While the other's are playing fetch, he barks at it and yelps and rushes it around sometimes like a soccer ball on each side other times he stands on it with both front feet. We tried him with other large balls, this is a great ball and the first he can't puncture."
0,THE WORST PAPER EVER!!!!!,DO NOT BUY THIS PAPER! My daughter put water and paint to it and after 3 brush strokes it tore! Cheap and thin paper I cannot believe they say that it can be used with paint!
0,Don't do it!,"Go to a local jewelery shop. Ring sizing is not possible on line, and this company takes zero responsibility for the fact that you will most likely get it wrong. It brought a significant amount of misery to what was a very special day for me."
1,Works well.,"This coffee maker makes a very good cup of coffee. I have a Cuisinart coffee maker that I really love, and the Aerobie makes coffee that tastes about as good as the Cuisinart. The Aerobie is easy to use and the directions supplied with it are well-written. I recommend that you experiment with the variables involved until you find what works best for you. That is, experiment with the amount of coffee used, temperature of the water, the amount of stirring, etc.I don't think the Aerobie will be my main coffee maker, but I can definitely see me taking it on trips, where I would not take a big coffee maker. It would be convenient to take camping, too, I think. There's no power requirements with the Aerobie; all you need is a way to heat some water."
1,Execution tourism.,"The originality of this book is to illustrate (in both senses) anti Jewish pogroms and the death camps from the viewpoint of the Germans involved. Some, like the truck driver from technical battalion six, simply witnessed atrocities in the Ukraine. Others such as Willi Mentz (the Gunman of Sobibor), were actively involved in the slaughter in the camps. So far as I am aware, there are some original photos here showing nazi personnel at leisure whilst off duty in the camps. Perhaps it was deliberate, but there is no conclusion to the book. The idea could be to let the letters, diaries and reports speak for themselves."
0,Good Acting skills..but boring movie,"Just saw it after a friend recommended it and hearing about how good this film is, the story is VERY lame. Bunch of high life kids doing and selling drugs..immature. Wasted my 2 hours watching this stupid film. Btw, I'm giving this movie away free to the next person whoever wants it, because I want this out of my hands. Maybe the next person will appreciate it more. I was about to give this movie a 1 star but gave two because of the acting. Overall, will not watch it again unlike some of the viewers here. This is such a depressing film."
0,A book for managers,"This is a book written for company managers to make them feel good about themselves when they are making unthought-out changes that drastically affect employees. Now they can say ""Here, read this book. It will help."" The book says that if you have low intellegence, no loyalty, don't think, and have no ethics, you will be happy and aimlessly move from job to job. If you have any of these qualities, you will be miserable. The only way I can see this book being so successful, is that managers buy them by the hundreds. It is not worth the paper it was written on."
0,Don't waste your time,"The Cutting Edge was one of my favorite movies of all time and to watch this was extremely painful. The skating scenes were not as good as the first one. I cringed at most of Christy Calson Romano's acting - really, really bad....Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time."

1,general scott is a living legend,"This book is an incredible adventure about a man who has had more adventures than 100 men combined. this story takes you to china and into combat.It is riveting and easy to follow. The audio version of the book is highly recommended and is read by Gen scott himself. it is packed with emotion! What one must realize is that gen scott has written 12 other books, the latest being ""The day i owned the sky"" in 1986. He is alive and well, 90 years young and living in Warner Robins, Ga., right outside of his hometown of Macon. He continues his work by helping raise money for the Museum of Aviation located at Robins AFB. He even carried the olympic torch when it came there, running the entire length..at 88 years old!! There is definitely more to the general than just this one book, and i implore everyone to jump in with both feet!!"
1,Patrick's Dinosaurs on the Internet,One night Patrick and his brother Hank were looking at pictures of Dinosaurs on the Internet. When they went to bed Patrick layed awaked looking at the screen. Right then a Dinosaur appeared and started talkin to him threw the computer! Later the dinosaurs came and picked him up. They traveled threw space and had little parties. If u like dinosaurs and are a kid u will love this story. This is a dream come true for Patrick and he has a blast with it. Patrick evan teaches them things in this story. This is one of my favorites stories of all time I think you will really like it.
0,Completely Unreliable,"I got one of these as a wedding present, but I had a reliable Oster blender so I shelved it. My Oster gave out after 3-4 years, and I fired this one up. It was very powerful, but it made a burning smell whenever I used it. Then a ring appeared around the base which was oil being thrown out from the blade assembly just under the jar bottom. After less than one month of use, liquid started to leak through the blade assembly onto the base. I recommend avoiding this."

1,cute,"I like it. The colors are definitely brighter once it's in the water. I find them even a bit too fluorescent, making it look fake (which it is, I know). Still a good buy and my fish are happy.EDIT: The reef in the picture has a much lighter base colors. The one I got has darker blues as a base color and then dark green, red and pink corals on top. So the look is completely different from the picture."
1,Relax people the book is not that bad.,"Awesome read.This is a very well-researched piece of literature!---period...I think people need to be informed to as much information from all different angles, on every subject regarding life, the universe and god, and anything else for what its worth. That way they can forge their own opinions on these touchy subjects, based upon the homework they have done. Even if the information they are recieving is a dubbed ""conspiracy theory"" by others or a cold stone fact for that matter.I liked this book and I recommend it to anybody interested in ancient history."
1,DONT LISTEN TO THE DUMBHEADS,"S. Darko is a really good film. Being a big fan of Donnie Darko, I was weary when I heard of a sequel being made. But you must remember it is just that A SEQUEL NOT A REMAKE!!! There is easily too many people put off by the film without even watching it or giving it a fair chance. This movie had the same imagery and story line that reeled me in with DD. It made me feel that same sadness and closeness to the characters once again. This movie is easily put on my shelf next to DD without any reserve. watch this movie with an open mind and remember its A SEQUEL NOT A REMAKE!!!!!"

0,German price for Chinese product,"I paid a premium price for this product which is described as being ""Designed and engineered in Germany"". Yes, it's a nice product as you would expect from Rosle, but it was only when I received the box that I found out that it was made in China and not Germany. I suppose this doesn't really make any difference, but I can't help feeling that I paid a huge premium for having someone in China stamp ""Rosle"" on this.And how much special effort is required to ""engineer"" a jigger, anyway? Eventually even the Chinese will be able to figure out how to do that without German assistance."
0,"Charming symponies, good performance though the Chandos...",Two great symphonies that should be a part of the repertoire of every orchestra.The Naxos performance is good but it is no match for the Jarvi performance on Chandos with the RSNO. That disc is worth the extra outlay given that the quality of the performance and the sound are so much superior. Thankfully Chandos has released the two symphonies on one disc in the last year.
0,DEAD END!,Another disappointing Maguire novel. Maguire has top-notch ideas but he really needs someone else to write the books for him! So many insignificant pages are in this book that if you took all of them out you'd have a pamphlet left! Maguire takes the reader down so many dead end roads that you are left frustrated and bewildered. The bottom line: The Maguire books look good on the shelf thanks to superb cover art but reading them can be downright torture sometimes!

1,"Sweet, dude.","I got turned on to this music at a hockey game, I've been describing it as the ""go king king go"" song (cause that's what it sounded like when I first heard it in ""Excaliber"") and could never find it. Then heard it on a commercial when I was near a classical music type person and was able to buy it (run a search for ""go king king go"" in Amazons search engine!).I'm sure everyone has heard this music, but not this quality. Other versions I've heard (like in movies, commercials, and hockey games) are almost indecipherable. The music overwhelms the singer people in the other ones, this version seems to me to be what the composer had in mind. Of course, the composer is probably dead so I don't know for SURE what he had in mind.Seriously, this has the best balance of the 2 or 3 versions I've heard. I wasn't until after hearing this disk that I found out that they don't EVER say ""go king king go""."
0,Question?,"There were some spectacular essays, but all-in-all, I was irritated into simply not caring about most of them. The essays went from interesting to redundant to predictable. And that's a frightening thing, I think; to predict the life experiences of real people.I just have one thing to ask, and this should sum up exactly how I feel:Mrs. Steiner, how can you expect to resolve anything if you don't use more variation?"
0,What's all the hype about??,"Well, after seeing all of the glowing 4 & 5 star reviews I assumed this would be a worthwhile read. How wrong I was!! The book takes a couple of simple concepts and beats them to death in a series of mind numbing stories written in old English style writing. I struggled to force my way through this less than 100 page book.The entire book basically boils down to pay your bills, save some, make it grow and live on the rest! All of this is conveyed in story form without any real substance or relative guidance. If you're looking for financial advice or guidance, I would recommend looking elsewhere and saving yourself the time of wading through this ""classic""."

0,"Unfortunately, they do leak . . .","I was so glad to find disposable diapers that were both chlorine and gel-free but was sadly disappointed. I didn't find the diapers too bulky or anything, and I loved them for the first couple of days, but then I got pooped all over . . . and then it happened again . . . and again . . . and I'm not talking about a little stuff coming out of the side -- I mean poop literally dripping out of the diaper and all over the floor/my lap/his clothes. Maybe for an older baby with more solid poop they would be fine, but these diapers just couldn't contain my baby's breastmilk poop. It's due to a poor design (the inner elastic is too loose and doesn't ""catch"" anything), and if they could fix it, these would be my diapers of choice -- but until then, I can't recommend these at all.Kudos to the company for trying to make a better disposable, though; it's a good idea and I hope they can find a way to make a better product soon."

0,Absolute garbage!,"This garbage is not worth owning. The writer is borderline insane. His ideas are that boxing is the only way to fight, and his broken English is next to impossible to follow. The author or his representitives are online over on Yahoo and plague the clubs with SPAM and obnoxious posts even after being asked to stop repeatedly. The material that we have viewed is poorly made and the instruction is of very poor quality. You would be better off going to a third grade playground and learning to fight from the class bully. Do yourself a favor and do not waste your money on these books. He has further made reference that America deserved the attack on the 9/11. I would not give this man ANY American money."

0,Don't know! I Sent the Product Back! False Advertizing,"It's a good product from Garmin. But Amazon False advertized this product on their site for a third party company. These data cards are not an SD, they are just labeled data cards per garmins marketing. SD was added to the ad to make the consumer think it's a SD card which is not. SO BE CARFUL WHEN ORDERING! The SD cards are in a mirco format with an standard SD adaptor to fit many Garmins GPS units on the market.So all in all I returned the item and ordered thru another company."
0,Un-teaching me Math,"I come from a Physics background, so I have extensive knowledge of Differential Equations, Calculus, etc. This has to be one of the WORST books I've ever read. First of all, it's filled with almost 15 pages of ""Errata"" - including the author messing up a Taylor Series Expansion. That's ridiculous - no publisher should have allowed this book to go on the market so full of mistakes with the author so unwilling to correct them.Secondly, the book teaches you absolutely no Math at all. Half of the lectures in each chapter are obscure, random models the author picked, and suddenly is capable of making assumptions about each model that seem completely arbitrary. There is no reasoning behind half of the steps the author takes.I'm sorry, but I swear I'm becoming bad at math trying to use this textbook. Using this book is a waste of time and money. I can't wait to put it in the fireplace."
0,What a bummer,I wish Grandma had read these reviews before buying this for my daughter. Its has been a nightmare! Sometimes works sometimes doesnt. Now we have downloaded songs on it but it wont play. Comes up saying not authorized. DUH. It worked on the same songs before so I'm not sure what is wrong with it. Dont buy it!
0,Price is Misleading,"When I saw the original price according to Amazon ($300) and the selling price(39.99), I thought I am getting a great deal and a great product. In fact the set does not worth even a $50. The quality is poor, it looks nice but the material is of low quality, thin cloth, less filling, poor stiching. The color in the picture is also misleading, its kind of pinkish in the picture but actually its brown.So if you are buying, don't expect the quality of a $300 comforter, it just worth $30-40"

0,27A45 Stopped working after only one year!,"I purchased the Toshiba 27A45 about one year ago. I was happy with the picture and the sound, especially for the money. Plus, I thought that Toshiba was a reliable brand. After all, I had owned another Toshiba without problems for over 10 years!I came home yesterday to find the TV would not turn on. I pushed the power button, and nothing! I then did a web search on this model to see if, by chance, there was a fuse or something that I could replace. I discovered that I was not the only person to have problems with this model. From what I gather, the TV has a manufactering defect which causes connections to come loose. Now, after just one year, I'm forced to by another TV. Guess which brand it *WON'T* be!"

1,Julie Andrews is the star!,"This film, in my opinion is exactly the kind of film Julie Andrews needed. She breaks free from her forever view of being ""the perfect nanny"" and becomes the maddening and infuriaiting theater star, Gertrude Lawrence.This film has some of the most spectacular numbers and wonderful scenery and costumes(that being my favorite aspect!) Julie Andrews is wonderful as the actress searching for a love to equal that of an audience. Daniel Massey plays Lawrences Lifelong friend 'Noel Coward' and he is also brilliant, his clever lines and witty attitude amuse you thoroughly. This film is my favorite film of Julie Andrews and has greatly influenced me in the genre of Musical Theater, this is one Hollywood musical you do not want to miss!!"

1,Girls liked it,"Purchased this the summer before middle school started, after I realized she was having concerns but she didn't seem to want to talk about it. Her and her friends read this book over and over. I don't think there was anything particularly important in it, very vague... but it helped build her confidence, so I have to recommend it. This also led me to purchase American Girl's ""Care and Keeping of You"". Neither book has been mentioned out loud but I have noticed they get a lot of wear."

David was the guy who plaid in the famous old serie Kung Fu for those who don't remember. I guess we can't make more ridiculous than David Carradine in a dress and wearing a wig. The other main actor is Paul Smith, the big sadistic warden from Midnight Express. I can't believe how the acting is so bad, howz the story is so crap and creme de la creme, the soundtrack ! Oh my god, it's SOOOO BADDDD. The weak story tells about weirdos who raise the promitive way, Sonny boy.If you see this flick, avoid it. Not funny, not creepy, no quality !"
1,a glimpse of a hidden world,"While this book is not meant to be an anthropological analysis of Muslim women, it does give insight into the Muslim world at large. It is broad in scope and should cite information more, but it can be an excellent choice to begin the journey to understanding. It should not be considered the final destination. I suggest this book to all."
0,Are you kidding me?,"I can't believe how many people gave this awful movie good reviews. The premise is absurd: namely, that anybody would even THINK about giving up three or six years of their lives to live in a hideous torture cell just so some friend that they barely knew in the first place won't hang - preposterous in itself - for smoking some hash.My advice to Joaquin Phoenix would have been: Sorry, pal, but get a better lawyer.A ridiculous storyline that wasted some fine acting talent."

Just alone Mr. Vaughan's views on politics and then add in some hints about where his powers came from and the crazed maniac killer butchering people in the subways, man, this book is good! Add on Harris' artwork, which is just getting even better, and his amazing attention to detail, and great capturing of people's expressions and reactions, man, this book is good! Vaughan's writing is tight and fun and revolting and inspiring and, man, this book is good!Basically, man, this book is good!"
0,the 3rd or 4th worst writer of his generation,"The most appealing thing about this book is the candy on the cover. These stories are, in a word, dull. No memorable characters. No gripping--or even mildly interesting--plots.One editorial review in praise of this book is telling. It calls the collection ""finely crafted"" which I suppose is roughly equivalent to praising a movie for its cinematography: it's fine if you're in to that sort of thing, but don't expect too much in the way of entertainment.In my opinion, it's Rick Moody's ""style"" that is largely to blame for the crappiness of this book. A guy in a chicken suit crashing a wedding ought to be interesting. But in Rick Moody's meandering, digressive prose, even this quirky scenario manages to become quite tiresome.If you enjoy overblown language and slim plots, you may enjoy this book. I give it two stars because it's mediocre and forgettable rather than offensively bad."
1,"Solid device, pricey maps","While I have been very impressed with this unit's features, I think it can't be stated enough for prospective buyers, this unit comes with an essentially worthless basemap that does NOT offer street routing.

0,Buy Guerrilla Marketing instead,"In the author's own words ""you'll want to read Guerrilla Marketing after you have finished this"". I agree with him, with one exception: I wish I had read Guerrilla Marketing before this one !Guerrilla Marketing is a legandry book by J. Conrad Levinson, but this one, Guerrilla Marketing Attack is just a book to earn some money on the fame and name of Guerrilla Marketing.It's really amazing, each topic, touches upon a subject and then says ""see Guerrilla Marketing for more details"". There is nothing ""new"" in this books as the title suggest, just summaries of the ideas and points covered in Guerrilla MarketingJ. C.

0,NFL Gameday 2001 vs. Madden 2001,"NFL Gameday 2001- Bad graphics (Playstation 1 graphics on the Playstation2 system) o.k. gameplayMadden 2001 The best graphics yet for anything (even computer) Has to be the best gameplay of any football game yet.I saw a review of NFL Gameday 2001 in a Playstation magazine....and it showed a picture of a quarterback throwing the football... The football, as it left the quarterbacks hands traveled right....his hand was throwing to the left. WHATS WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE?! I don't like putting games down, but buy Madden 2001 first, then rent Gameday 2001 after....compare, then write a review for both. :-)"
0,Hole in bag!,"Bag came with a hole! The entire box was filled with salt and don't accept returns, I was hoping to make this product my salt of choice for everyday use but never again will I buy this!!!"
1,interesting historical fiction novel,"Marie Duell is a marvelous writer of historical fiction. She portrays each and every character so vividly that you begin to love every one as your own. From the very start of the novel, I was hooked. I simply could not put it down. I only got this book in the first place so I wouldn't be bored on my plane trip. What I thought would be a semi-interesting book to occupy my interests momentarily, ended up being an obsession. Even when I reached my destination, and my boyfriend, I had to read this book to the very end. To the very end of the book I was guessing at the twists and turns the plot would take. Not once did I guess right (and I read a lot of these books). I was thoroughly impressed by Ms. Duell."
1,Spoon Rest,A very nice product. My spaghetti spoon loves it's new decorative holder! Would have been nice if it was ceramic though.
1,One of the most comprehensive I've read on the subject,"I found this book to be quite fascinating and readable (unlike so many authors of scholarly works Ms. Hutchinson can actually write!) If the book only included numerous details on archaeological ship sites with photos and diagrams of the sites and finds (and it does) that would be enough. But the author also includes concise and useful overviews on the sailing, building, design, fitting, rigging, navigating and whatnot of period ships. All in all a quite valuable reference."
0,No good for hard metals,If supposely it is carbide should work on hard metals. It broke while tapping the metal. Had to pay extra for a professional to do the job because of the poor quality of this product
0,He can't find the truth!,"Want to really see into Al's mind, then read this book instead <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060761288/qid=1133966836/sr=8-5/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i5_xgl14/102-5009468-1848106?n=507846&s;=books&v;=glance"">100 People Who Are Screwing Up America (And Al Franken Is #37)</a>. Mr. Franken does not appear to be a stable man. Humor aside, he goes off the deep end one too many times.I always thought he was funny with his characters on SNL, but now that he's doing ""reality"" radio, I'm not too sure? His interview with Bernard Goldberg is frightening. I wouldn't let this Franken borrow my watch, let alone go to for advice.I do have to give him credit, he honestly answers Mr. Goldberg's questions and if he truly believes the things he says, then WOW, it's even worse than I thought.The Truth? Maybe in his world, but not in the one anyone I know lives in."
1,LCKSFREADER,I loved this book. I found the stories to be humorous without being glib. I travel a lot for work and this was the perfect book to pick up and be transported away from the realities of my work schedule. Morris' friendly approach leaves the reader with a feeling of endless possibility -made me want to go somewhere and do something. Each chapter introduced me to a new place and a new DIVA -I found this structure ideally suited to my reading habits and time constraints. A compelling and inspiring distraction from my day to day grind.
0,1 of 2 won't take a charge,These batteries were a gamble and since only one of two holds a charge I'd have to say you're better off purchasing the recent stock batteries whick look to only come in black.
1,Well made movie,"This is a well made movie, entertaining and good remake of a classic film. It has some new ideas not in the original story but holds true to the story. I would recommmend it if you are a western movie fan, a fan of the stars (Crowe and Bale) or just want to watch something different."
0,"great potential, poor execution","this dvd could have been great. the concert footage is rough but clear enough, and the backstage interview is pretty funny. what kills it, though, are the constant interruptions by some jackass sitting in his backyard telling us why andy kaufman is funny. if you are into andy kaufman enough to buy what you think is gonna be an entire concert of his from his prime, you don't need someone to explain the humor. if you do buy this, get it used and get ready to do some fast forwarding."
0,Vinegar Hill is fitting title,"--as this is the sourest, most depressing bunch of people I've read about in a while.I assume we were supposed to feel for Ellen as she struggled against oppression, but I found her and the rest of this crew totally unredeemable and tiresome.Beyond the morbid turn of the story, there are too many side stories and subplots that leave you wondering, ""Why?"" or just, ""Huh?""I bought this book about a week before it hit Oprah's list. If I'd known she was picking it, I probably wouldn't have bought it as I have found most of her picks to be celebrations of whining women or minorities. The only one of her picks I've really enjoyed was Ernest Gaines', _A Lesson Before Dying_."
1,Beyond stunning,"In the midst of a major depressive episode, this concert yanked me from the depths with its vitality and absolute exuberance and had me in tears of joy in appreciation of it sublime brilliance. Sure it's 7 years later...this performance will almost certainly do the same in 70 more."
0,completely useless - garbage,"at first this seems like the perfect antirvirus program... cheap, uses up very minimal resources, simple to use.. lifetime subscription for free.. what could be wrong?EVERYTHING. see, the problem isn't that this program can't find viruses.. the problem is IT FINDS THEM AND DOESN'T DO ANYTHING WITH THEM. that's right, it leaves the viruses right there!! how is that useful in any way? i looked in options to make sure it cleaned or deleted viruses, but still the log report would announce to me ""(this many) viruses could not be deleted or cleaned."" well, thanks for nothing. i'm going to return this and get a real antivirus program."
0,One of the WORST...,"I found the concept of Death as an occupation utterly fascinating and was looking forward to reading this series. Boy was I dissapointed!The dialoge is the WORST I have ever read - conversations with the female 'love interest' were trying at best, and with the Devil were beyond ridiculous. I kept thinking that the words were not matching the characters personalities - shallow as they are.Multiple times I found myself putting the book down in disgust for lack of depth when dealing with major religious overtones. The only reason I finished it was b/c I was on a cruise and had nothing else to read.Needless to say I won't be reading the rest of the series."
0,A Criminal...,"His claim is that he has been competing all his life so he deserves to compete once again. What he fails to acknowledge is that he never competed in his life since doping is not a competition, it is a crime. After making his money illegally by doping, he harassed, sued, threaten everyone and anyone who made any statement not to his liking and now he is looking for forgiveness. He should be sent to a prison and allowed to preach his senseless vision behind bars. He should be treated as a criminal and pay for his lies, manipulation and disregard to all rules of a sport and humanity... A white color criminal, the lowest form of human being, a true disgrace. I truly feel sorry for his siblings since they will have to endure difficulties for a sick parent like him when they had nothing to do with his actions. Wish his siblings health and happiness."
1,Great Purchase,This activity jumper is excellent!! It has 4 stations so your child doesn't lose interest in it. It's like a new toy everything he gets in!!Our child has increased his balance and leg strenght tremendously with this product. I highly recommend this!
1,two for the road,"I like the film, but the DVD had a glitch..the first 4 scenes wouldnt play...had to skip them...wasnt too bad as I have seen the film 4 times before ,so I didnt miss ,much...still was a shame.movie is great though!"
0,ZERO STARS,"I bought this with high hopes of a quick teeth whitener. I did have low expectations because it does seem a little to good to be true, and when something seems to good to be true it normally is. I used this product about 6 times I used one full tube of the whitener, and my results were absolutely nothing but a gross gel in my mouth. The light also doesnt go out after 10 min, I also left it in more then 10 min the first time I have no idea since the light didnt turn off maybe like 35 minutes and all the rest of the times at least 15 minutes. Rusults, nothing...good luck if you buy this product and I hope it works for you because it didnt work for me. :(-Two thumbs down."
0,Did not like it,"Acting was flat, story line was garbled. I'm a Bruce Willis fan, which is why I rated it as high as I did."
0,less ideal,"Relatively speaking, this shoe is not comfortable. They did not have that cushion I was looking for. Secondly, I feel the leather inside with my socks on. Thirdly, when I walk they come lose at the back. I am 11 M and these felt 11.5 M."
1,Sturdy and has held up well,I've been using this 5 days a week and it's held up well. Works as advertised and it's not flimsy like other cheaper clips. Easy to get the phone in and out in time to answer calls. No complaints here.
0,Absolute Waste of Celluloid Film Stock,"Chalk this dispicable piece of claptrap as another dud starring the incredibly untalented and clueless Shari Belafonte. ANYTHING she appears in is made worse as soon as she moves into frame. If her last name weren't of a semi-famous sort, she would not even pass the audition. As it is, the actors have to emote and mug shamelessly just to make up for her disconnected and not-even close to amateurish acting pose. I profoundly regret even the few minutes I spent watching this piece of trash. Hint to Hollywood: ban the Belafontess."
0,Not worth the $$$,"Not easy to put together as most of the screw holes, especially for the drawer, are misaligned. The hex wrench that comes with it strips out more screws then it secures properly, and nothing on the cart seems to fit securely. It's very wobbly when any force is out on it. The quality just really isn't what I expected for this price. I would certainly return this product if not for the hassle of taking it apart again and shipping it back. Really a big disappointment.Eventually I did end up returning it for a refund."
0,Measurements inherently flawed,"I had a series of electronic body composition measurements taken at a gym over a period of months. The practitioner used electrodes all over my body, with skin preparation as would be used for an EKG, and still the variation in readings was far greater than could be possible, thus invalid. As others have said, get calipers and learn how to use them.Also, people, forget about BMI. This was a measurement developed to study POPULATIONS, and never intended for the evaluation of individuals. Use common sense. How can a value that considers only weight and height be a valid reflection of an individual's health and fitness? Muscle is denser than fat, so an individual with minimal muscle will show a lower BMI than a heavily-muscled one of the same stature. Are we to believe that the lower BMI in this example indicates the healthier of the two? Nonsense!"
1,A great introduction to Islam,"This book is beautifully written and illustrated. I was moved by the first person accounts of Islamic practices like prayer, fasting, etc.We all HAVE to learn more about Islam, and this book is one of the best ways to begin"
0,Do some research on youtube first,"Search on youtube for Fram filters. The video take aparts are not friendly towards Fram at all. My mechanic swears by these, but judging from the videos they are made very cheaply nowadays. Spend a little more and get a good Wix or Napa filter instead, your car will run better for it!"
1,Great Knife,"I'm not a chef, but I do cook a lot. I was using one of those Martha Stewart style knife blocks I got as a wedding gift. Without knowing any better, I thought it was great. I purchased this knife because I wanted a nicer chef's knife. Wow, this thing is awesome. I don't use anything else anymore. I think I will be buying a few more of this brand to have a small set. For the price, this knife is great."
0,On Becoming a Person,Well I found it boring...I finally used it to hold up a fan. If you are a Carl Rogers fan then read it if not it is dry and dull
1,THE FIRST PHILIPINO DIVA!!!!,GREAT FUN ALBUM. A LITTLE BIT OF ECSTASY IS SOOO HOT. AND THE REMAKE OF YAZ'S ONLY YOU WOULD BRING THE HOUSE DOWN. GREAT FIRST ALBUM!
0,Horrible does not adequately describe.,"I picked this movie up w/o even reading about it first because I love Gere and Sarandon. I have never been so disappointed. What the movie amounted too was this: Poor rich man makes bad decisions in money and love and pays off everyone to get himself out of it. This story line has been done so many times that its sad Gere and Sarandon wasted their time with it. The only Character I was interested in was Jimmy Grant played by Nate Parker, but only because there was nothing else to be interested in. I can't even relate how poorly this movie was done. Details are bad, acting was bad, story was bad, ending...well that went beyond bad. Please save yourself from wasting your time on this movie. Please, I beg you!"
0,snugabunny swings better,"I compared this swing to the fisher price snugabunny swing and I prefer the snugabunny. This papasan cradle swing is slightly smaller and the motor must be weaker because it barely swings my 11 lb baby at all. Both swings have about the same amount of motor noise, it doesn't bother the baby and when I'm watching tv I don't notice the noise. I definitely appreciate that both swings come with an ac adapter, much cheaper than replacing batteries."
1,I like this book!,"This book has a lot of information that I can use to manage my network and my employees who use the network. I appreciate the honest, straight-forward advice...she tells me the truth and offers some ways to help me do my job. And don't you wonder about those two reviews from Apr. 22? Maybe they're written by a competitor..."
1,Great Gift,I bought this for my husband for Christmas since it was such a good price. He has used it a few times and says it is great. Not super powerful but perfect for around the house jobs.
1,Rugged and elegant at the same time!,"OMG what a gorgeous bag!!! Well made and really really stylish. Even the zipper pulls are elegant looking. Handy pockets (not too many). I got the Olive and the color is absolutely wonderful, with contrasting interior lining - bright orange - a hot combination. This is the start of a long future of loving this bag, I'm so happy! :0)"
0,One question....WHY???,"So here we are with a Creed Greatest Hits cd. Wow. This band made 3 albums of the most unoriginal music, and get a ""Greatest Hits"" album. Well, here are the facts.1. Creed isn't as good as you think they are.2. Scott Stapp cannot sing.3. Creed is no more, stop your crying.All in all, a waste of money for a load of songs that we're all worse off for having been exposed to."
0,Snore,One of Le Carre's more convoluted plot lines. A real struggle to keep people straight and time lines. I think this is the last Le Carre book I'll listen to.
1,IL Divo - Live at the Greek,FANTASTIC. This DVD as well as the Encore DVD is always in my DVD player.
0,Krap,This album is awful every song sounds exacltly the same. I think i even fell asleep listening to it. I loved the first single but after i bought the album it ruined it for me. Don't waste your money on this Linkin Park rip off. I tried to take it to fye to exchange it for a new cd but guess what? they wouldn't take it beacuse they already had too many copies. Hmmm.... Would you like fries with that?
0,Not all it's cracked up to be,"I bought it to take traveling. Tried it out at home (thank goodness). It may work for long, straight hair that just needs drying, but for shorter hair that needs styling with a brush, this doesn't work at all. It blows the hair in all directions..off of the styling brush, off of curlers. Even the concentrator nozzle doesn't help..my hair wound up literally standing on end! I'm returning it and trying something else."
1,First Towel,"This is my first travel / microfiber / adventure / whatever towel..While it is NOT a regular towel, it does get the job done.I got the medium sized one. It is a little smaller than a normal bath towel, but it is easily sufficient to dry yourself with.I would rather use a real towel, but this one serves it's purpose. It's compact and it gets me dry."
1,Prolithic and gifted,"Dj tiesto is one of the longest running and most creative trance Dj's to date. this release is another example of his complete mastery of more than a few trance styles and an exploration into musical expression that is often formless for Tiesto. in the track ""flight 643"" or as it apears on the cd ""643"", he grabs the ears of every producer trying to be the new thing and says, hey, this IS the new thing. it also makes for an awsome underground ... up club frenzy experience. this album is sure to make musical history for trance music and the like."
1,There ain't a shotgun in the place,"This is a goofy film. Most of the descriptions I read call it a parody of Spaghetti Westerns. That has me thinking Italian ""Blazing Saddles."" A better point of reference would be the more recent ""Shanghai Noon."" If you enjoyed that film's blend of action and comedy, you'll probably get a kick out of ""My Name is Nobody."" Terence Hill is charming and hilarious as wily sharpshooter Nobody, who's scheming to get his biggest hero, gunslinger Jack Beauregard (Henry Fonda)to take on the hundred fifty plus members of the Wild Bunch. Fonda just wants to get on a ship and retire overseas.Ennio Morricone provides another one of his inimitable scores: a quirky mixture of Moog, strings, and Wagner, which keeps a lively pace right up to the final frame."
0,totally unscary and innocuous,"This new nord odin worshipping metal is cheesy, although maybe not specifically this band . Egypt taught the loudmouth Greeks everything, read some Herotodus and find out. India is the most beautiful spiritual culture. this music has the illusion of being creative. listen to nomeansno or victims family or some jazz or fusion. this is not dark try diamanda galais. Bad brains are way better. try flesh parade or something that has humour. Watchtower are the kings of metal. American bands are way cooler except for sabbat, napalm,at the gates,king diamond, celtic frost,rudimentary peni,carcass and maybe a few or more others. The Fifth Dimension and Wesley Willis give off way better energy. Imanentize the Eschaton of 2012 and beware the Numshub of Enki and the Shem of the jealous demiurge Ialdaboath."
1,Best Song Of 99,Being a male my ego usually takes over when I listen to a love song and I hate it. Kiss Me however has me quite captivated with it. It is a beautiful song and the woman singing it does an excellent job. I don't think it could be done any better by anyone else. It is undoubtably the best song of 1999.
1,Great quality,"The quality of this product is great, easy to clean and fits my sink perfectly.However, I think it is a little bit expensive."
1,DeWalt 6' random orbital sander,"I have used this sander for over 12 years on a daily basis and even though it may not be the most comfortable tool in my shop, I am used to it and it does a great job. Connected to a Fein vac, it is practically dustless. Contrary to the claim that 6"" hook and loop sanding disks are hard to find, I have had no problem buying them at my local wood supply store in grits ranging from 60 to 320. The tool does vibrate and is somewhat noisy, but it works fast and evenly, and since ear protection is a shop requirement (and so is dust protection), noise is no problem. I'm glad DeWalt is still making this model, because I don't know what I would do without it..."
0,Inked,"The book had a blotch of purple ink on the bottom of nearly every page; I sent it back and asked for a book that wasn't damaged, but obviously that never happened."
0,240 CD ... NOT ...,"Yes, there are 240 slots. They are paired. The front slot is suppose to be for the cover .. and the back slot holds the CD/DVD .. very deceptive ... 2 stars off on that. another star for over pricing the item for only 120 slots item. 2 Stars for well constructed .... I will keep it .. not worth the hassle to return."
0,right as rain,"i have read 160 pages and still am not compelled to continue this book to the end. the plot is boring and predictable . it does not pull you forward, wondering what happens next. the writing is very good, no question about that; but it proceeds too slowly and has not grabbed my interest. i will read lahaine, colben, crais, and connelly before coming back to pelecanos."
1,Intriguing,"This short tale was very well done, and I thoroughly enjoyed Klaus Janson's art style. One minor issue of note is that the paper the book is printed on is not exceptionally high quality, and I occasionally found it obnoxious.As far as the story goes, I believe Morrison did an excellent job. He managed to tie the villain in to an extremely important incident in Bruce Wayne's pre-Batman, pre-death of parents life; an amazing feat considering how much of Batman's past has been accounted for. Morrison very much made this story monumental to Batman's life, instead of just another villain with another agenda.My only quibble lies with the ending. I felt Batman got off too easily. I won't give anything away here, but I do not think the ending was worthy of the importance of the story itself.Overall though, an excellent read. And the ending is not bad, per se, I just think Batman didn't have to try very hard. I would highly recommend this book."
0,What a Mess!,"Perhaps there is more than one Ravioli Attachment for the Imperia Pasta Machine and if so I'd like to know about it. Using the ravioli maker attachment was impossible as all it did was squish out the filling (spinach/ricotta) and mash up the pasta dough into lumps that stuck to the wheels of the machine meaning that I had to use a toothpick to get it all out - and, wasted enough dough so that I was afraid I would not have enough for the dinner I'd planned for 4 of us. I switched to the perfect serrated round ravioli cutter to make my ravioli by hand. IF, by some miracle you are able to roll out some ravioli they are teeny tiny ravioli that you'd need about 100 of to make dinner for 4. What a stupid machine! Love the pasta maker though.."
1,Works just as it should!,"Great replacement for the original, fits great. I haven't had it that for all that long but it gives just as long battery life as the original. We will see how it does later in its life!"
1,Lots to learn about this topic!,"This is a book for nearly everyone. The topics covered can help to identify behaviors you may see everyday. Very helpful, and often right on target with patterns and ways in which to work successfully."
1,Great underwear,The best I have ever had. Very comfortable. The cotton is a wonderful feeling next to your body. Will buy again. Really beats the nylon ones.
0,Useless - does nothing except look pretty!,I installed the antenna as per instructions and it did NOTHING. Zilch.... NadaFind something else if you're serious about getting an extra bar.This device is a total waste
1,Gorgeous but....,"The glasses are gorgeous, very light and almost don't get warm to the touch so you don't burn your hands with an extremely hot espresso, but... they have a small hole on the bottom. I am not an expert in glass blowing techniques but I would suppose the small hole is the result of the technique in order to make the double wall. Well, the problem is that one of my glasses has gotten water inside and I am unable to dry it out. I have left it several days over my Rancilio Silvia which has a warming tray on the top, hoping that the heat will evaporate the water inside but no result. Next step is to place it over a higher heat source, I'll try also to microwave it unsure of the results. Be careful when washing them by hand and I would advise they are not dishwasher safe."
1,None Better,"Amazing combination of origional writing, great story and awesome acting.I have given this movie to more friends than any other.And, there are witches,.... And good guys, and really bad guys. and.....See it"
1,Very Nice Movie,"This was a very nice family movie, although we watched it as a girls night movie. Jodie Foster was unexpected in this movie, but as always she was great and made the movie better. Abigail Breslin was great in her role and made the movie. As for Gerard Butler, this is the type of movie I first noticed him in and would like to see him do more family, nice guy roles."
0,it was...,"it was ok, it came on time, but the top of the clogen was bent and stuff had spelt in the box so there was a little more then half a bottle left and the package was saturated in the clogen"
1,Great comfortable sheets - wash and wear well a year later,We've bought 3 sets of these sheets in different sizes for us and our parents. Colors aren't always true but the sheets are comfortable and reasonably long lasting.
0,Not that great.,I tried these and no matter what I do I can't get them to quick leaking. I have tried every method and they have yet to work correctly.
0,so poorly written it's agonizing to read,"This book is so poorly written it's agonizing to read. Instead of trying to grasp the intricacies of the 8051, I find myself correcting poorly worded and badly structured sentences. It seems as though it slipped through the editing process and went directly to print. If all of the nonsense drivel were eliminated, the book would be half as thick and probably make more sense. It's as amateurish as a paper describing a high school science-fair project. I don't think I could recommend this book to anyone. I definitely wouldn't recommend it for beginners. And, if a well-seasoned designer wanted to learn how to implement the 8051 into his/her next project, this book is an entire waste of time."
1,just what i was thinking,this filter is not bad. i is a strong neutral density filter that fits on a 58mm lens.there is not much to say about it. its good. good price. good look.i got this filter because i am trying to take pictures of the sunset and I want to see the outline of the red circle of the sun. this filter will not do that by it's self and I stacked all the filters I have on to my camera (including this new one) and still didn't achieve my goal. but if i get half a dozen of these things i think that would do it.
1,It was an o.k. book,"This book was good, I mean I read in about a day, it really gripped me, however it skipped around too much. Pointless things happened in the book like that battle against the Jhinkas, there was no point to that. And Janelle has soooo many friend, you can't keep track of them all. But never the less, I liked the book and I can't wait for Queen of the Darkness."
0,IN ONE WORD: BORING.,"BEING A DEVOTED FAN OF BELLINI OPERAS, I EXPECTED SOME FIREWORKS FROM THIS PIECE. WHAT I GOT WAS A WET RAG, IN SPITE OF VERY RELIABLE SOLOISTS. THE PROBLEM LIES WITH THE MUSIC ITSELF, WHICH NEVER TAKES FLIGHT, NEVER ACHIEVES THE REALM OF THE BEAUTIFUL. IN OTHER WORDS, IT DOES NOT MAKE YOU SIT UP AND LISTEN. RECOMMENDED ONLY FOR THOSE WITH PLENTY OF TOLERANCE."
1,Red Cliff International Version Part I & II,"An epic film that you have to watch. I have been constantly amazed by Chinese cinematography since Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. This film follows in that tradition. The plot is wonderful,the actors are great. I love the work of Tony Leung and Takeshi Kaneshiro. I have seen both actors in several movies acting together and separately, and have never been let down. This is one film you have to own."
0,Morey should give it up and convert to Islam,"Morey is so threatened by the success of Islam that he is willing to mislead Christian readers in order to try to discourage them from converting to or studying Islam objectively. He cannot deal with the truth of Islam so he has to disfigure and misrepresent it. I hope and pray that God guides all those who earnestly seek the truth to Him. Please read the Qur'an and judge for yourself. I used to have bad ideas about Islam myself, but when I read the Qur'an, I was not only impressed I decided to convert to Islam. Peace upon you dear readers."
0,Did they even hire an proofreader?,"I spent more on this edition due to the fact that it was an anniversary edition, which had endorsement from the Author's family & such. I thought it would be the best choice to add to my home library. Then I read it!This book has soooo many misspelled words! How many times can they call Maria ""Mania""? Instead of the word ""over"" the word ""oven"" is used! I cant even let my children read it for fear they will get confused!I don't know how it is possible that someone got paid for proofreading this book - and I can only wonder if the author's family is aware of how pathetic this version is, that they have endorsed!"
1,Too Blue Collar Blues,"How can you make standing on the assembly line in a GM plant funny? Hamper, who describes himself as, ""desended from royality,"" because his father and grandfather worked in the same plants, makes the dehumanizing process of the line a exceedingly humorous read.A friend and coworker of Michael Moore (TV Nation) Hamper, brings the frustration of a nowhere career to a funny light. Blue Collaring it, has a sense of hopelessness attached, but with a cynical edge style Hamper delievers a tour-de-force for all working class people to read."

1,A MUST HAVE for all pointe dancers!,"I am a twelve year old ballerina and LOVE this foot spray! After pointe, it cools off your toes and makes them smell so good! After I put it on, everyone in my dance class wanted to use some!Definitely recommended!!!!"
0,Thought this was a Christian study...,"A couple of the chapters in this workbook are worth while to do with your significant other--they give you a chance to talk about things that will affect your marriage eventually and help you and yours discuss these things and work them out before they can become a problem. But I don't recall any discussion about God, the Bible, or even any Bible verses being used to get there point across. Basically, this book says, ""Enjoy the time you have together now because when you get married, it's all downhill from there and it's going to take a lot of work with no benefits to keep it going."" That's truly the impression I got from reading the book and doing the workbook. In all fairness, I did quite reading the book and doing the study before I got to the end but only because I couldn't take anymore of their ""reality-check."" Truth is, you can have a wonderful marriage, that stays lively and full of love throughout your entire life. Bogus book/workbook. Stay away."
1,Couldn't put it down!,After reading each of the stories in this great collection of true police stories I was anxious to see what the next offered. The book is very difficult to put down.I thought the officers told their stories very honestly and openly. Excellent read!
0,Another piece of cheap junk,A barely perceptible amount of air and heat. It was hard to tell if the darn thing was on. Looks and feels cheaply made. I haven't used it for more than 5 minutes. I wonder if it will last 10.
0,Its All Been Said Before,"This was a disappointing book. Besides being long-winded and self-indulgent, if not downright egotistical,the book repeats that which has long been at the core of Asian American Studies scholarship. However, the book oversimplifies and overgeneralizes in ways that reputable scholarship never would. One thing is clear from the book -- Professor Wu really thinks highly of Professor Wu."
1,What Dreams May Come,"To me,this is one of the best Robin Williams movies I have ever seen.This movie WILL make you cry.This is the one movie where I was able to relate to the character,and feel their emotions as well.What Dreams May Come [VHS].This movie is about second chances,and about not giving up.Also,it is a movie to remind you not to take the things and people you have for granted,because life is short and can end at any time."
1,Entertaining and informative.,The book used effective verbal imagery to get the point across about the immune system. The passion of author can easily be seen by repeated use of exclamation points.

1,Still enjoyable after all these years,"I have always enjoyed this film.Funny, interesting idea. Good script.Even with WAY OLD MOVIE TRICK-CARS RUNNING INTO GARBAGE CANS, cars in car chases running into each other, that type of thing.Now we have 2 Oscar winners in it. Dreyfuss & Estevez had good chemistry as the 2 partners.Stowe in her short film career, all I ever remember from her in the 2 films I saw her in (remember, she went NO WHERE after this, her only hit movie) was her taking her clothes off.An older DVD, needs to be released.NO extras.Since it is older, nice to have a chapter search page.BUT, WHAT I CAN NOT FIGURE OUT. A 2 HOUR MOVIE & ONLY 10 CHAPTER STOPS?And, widescreen the way it should be seen.The unnecessary sequel I saw once & was NOT funny. Stick to this, the original."
0,Not the same quality,"I purchased these briefs based on past experiences. Based on reviews I had read, I ordered one size smaller than I normally would have. It likely helped some, but still not happy with product. I will not buy this brand again. It's to bad they chose to alter the quality of what was a very good brief."
0,Dissappointed!!!!,"Beware!!! The coupler lock pictured is not the one that Amazon sends. It is an updated model which is not as good. Also, Amazon shows two sets of keys but only ships one!!!"
1,Awesome Product,"I have been using this for about 3-4 weeks now. I use it to hold dairy. It keeps it cool the whole work day which is more than I was expecting. I have tried some other store bought brands, but Nissan just gets it right. Capacity is perfect, the cup/lid works great and secures easily. My only gripe if any would be the plug, it seals so tight that sometimes I have to use my shirt to get it started (it's hard to get a grip on the plug, they could have put more tread on it). I still give it five because the thing will not leak once it's sealed, that is worth hassling with the plug."
1,Top 10 BEST science fiction novel written,"Enders Game is one of the few novels I recommend to EVERYONE interested in reading fiction. This story is ageless, full of soul and triumph, and appeals to both male and female, young and elderly. I gave this book to my father, my teenage son and daughter.....and my nail tech (20 yr old guy)!If I had to choose 10 books to take to a deserted island, this would be one of them (I know, sounds stupidly dramatic, whatever).*THANK YOU, THANK YOU, ORSON SCOTT CARD."
0,Not Worth It,"Flimsy and doesn't stay adjusted.Once you set the sensitivity, you never know when it's going to come on. Save your money."
1,Fascinating read for Disneyland fans,I really enjoed the first chapter on how the concept translated into the final product of a ride. Amazing how these things come together. The second chapter comparing the ride throughs between the four parks I found a bit frustrating - hard to really picture it unless you're there (for me). I was more interested in the ride portion than the movie chapter myself. Worth the buy (though I bought it used).
0,What's all the hype about?,"I've rented this game from a video store and I'm glad I did instead of plopping down $50 for it. The gameplay is slow, the recievers drops a lot of passes, and at least on Xbox, the quarterback occasionally makes throws a pass prior to me initiating the pass. Also the fair catch button doesn't work for some reason. When I go in the practice mode, the quarterback always throws the ball without my input. Lot of people here give this game high marks but I just can't see what the fuss is about, it's more frustrating than anything."
0,One of the worst books I've read from one of my fave authors,"I discovered Fay Kellerman a couple of years ago and grew enamored of her Peter Decker/ Rina Lazarus series. I excitedly tore into Moon Music but was VERY disappointed. Flat characters and a confusing, ridiculously implausible plotline fatally mar this work. There is little sense of time and place and I never got to like any of these characters. It was a chore to trudge through this book and I did not feel rewarded at the end."

0,"In the dictionary under uncomfortable, I actually found this picture","I'm a tall guy, 6'8"", and so finding a chair that actually provides some lumbar support is nigh impossible. I saw this actually on an article on lifehacker, and decided to take a chance on it. I had it on my chair for a total of 15 minutes,fiddling with it the whole time trying to find a sweet spot, and then I took it off and put it in the closet, where its been for the past 3 weeks.For forcing improved posture, it's probably pretty good. For comfort? Just invest in a new chair, as this shortcut will only lead to disappointment."
0,a give away,"this film was very dissappointing. a mediocre tv movie is the result of the hard work of many people.the story is boring, a stupid revenge plot. the setup could have been interesting - new york/americas in its childhood - but the makers give it away. well, maybe the artists behind this work are simply overrated?"
0,Amazon lied,"I did a search for razors made in the U.S.A. I specifically didn't want a product made in China. When I performed my search this product was listed as made in the U.S.A. Imagine my disgust when I got the product and my husband opened it up and clearly stamped into the metal it proudly announced ""Made in China"". Will not be buying from Amazon anymore except for books."

1,Good unit and reliable so far,"I have been using the DNS-323 for about one month and so far there have not been any problems with the unit. It is quite fast for file storage and recovery, and for playing back media files. However, it is less than spectacular for other file operations, such as combining RAR files, updating records, etc."
1,"Thorough, accesible and useful guide","This book is a well written and clear guide for pet owners. The information is timely and thorough and covers a wide spectrum of topics beyond medication that every pet lover will appreciate. It's also a great help in resolving those questions of ""is this serious (requires a trip to the vet) or should I wait a day and see if he gets better?"" The author has packed a wealth of knowledge into a small package! I think this book should be sold in veterinarians' offices everywhere!"

0,Serious issues holding connector,"This product would be great, if it could hold the RJ45 connector in place. Unfortunately, it relies on gravity to keep the connector in-- if you even touch the wire, the connector falls out.If you plan on placing this connector in a totally stable environment, it might work. Otherwise, I would stay away."
1,"Absolutely amazing, one of the best books out there!","Christopher Paolini deserves everyone's complete and sincere thanks, for he has opened up a world that is captivating, adventurous, romantic, mystical, fun, and unique.His storytelling is fantastic, and his story is fantastic as well. It lacks nothing.This book tells the amazing adventure of Eragon, a boy who suddenly has the fate of the land of Alagaesia fall into his own hands. It tells of his amazing journey through this unique and wonderful land, which has been largely corrupted by an evil king.This book, and it's sequel, ""Eldest"", are some of the best books out there. Buy this book now, you will NOT be disappointed! :-D"

1,Harry Hits Dead On,"From the now signature line uttered in the coffee shop by Harry, ""Go Ahead. Make My Day"" to when Inspector Calahan yells at his dog Meathead and a jogger thinks that Harry yelled at her to the climax on the roller-coaster this is one ""Dirty Harry"" movie that hits the mark so Go Ahead. Buy this flick. with apologies and great admiration to Clint Eastwood"
1,Understanding the Purpose and Power of Woman,Every man and woman should definitely read this book.Especially if you are in a relationship or looking to get into one.
1,Bring them back!,"Sincerely hope the authors bring back the Alperts in another adventure! (Especially now that they are independently wealthy and don't necessarily have to return to gainful employment -- as exciting or boring as it might be.)This global tale of intrigue, complete with dastardly characters and near-death experiences, will have you wanting to skip ahead, but at the same time not wanting to miss a beat.You will surely want to read another adventure involving the witty, intelligent, savvy and lovable Alperts."
0,Get Real,"The fact is that without Rob Thomas, this would have been another overlooked Santana album. Since Matchbox had waited so long to release another album, people were willing to buy this to get a fresh track from Rob. ""Smooth"" gets 5-stars. Most of the rest gets 1-star. Average: 1-star."
1,The Last Samurai CD,This CD is great. I used it to set the mood for an Asian murder mystery dinner party that I hosted. The music worked perfectly and the shipping was fast.

0,What a lousy toaster! Even Cusinart Service said so!,"I had that toaster for 10 days and could never get it to toast properly. On a low setting of just 3 then on each piece of toast one side was badly burnt while the other side was acceptable. Then at a 2 setting one side would be OK but the other side wasn't even tan and barely dried! I gave up and called the 800 number and complained. The service rep told me they have had many problems with that model. I'm not an engineer, but the problem is the center coils have twice the number of heating wires than what the outsides have. Pretty obvious why it's a piece of junk. Steer clear of that toaster!!!"
0,More obnoxious than creative.,"I found this HBO special nauseating, with each monologue worse than the previous. Ensler's presentation tried to generate enpowerment of and sensitivity to women. For me, it failed, and I just could not get past the yuckiness and nonsense of it all. The snippets of real interviews conducted that were the basis for her play and even her short interspersed commentary were much more enjoyable than the actual monologues. 2 stars for those brief portions, zero kudos for the rest.I am far from a prude and am open to all genres of expression. However, what I found here was an bunch of extremely silly material for people who think themselves artistically progressive. Unfortunately, this makes the rest of us wanna roll our eyes and scratch our heads wondering why we bothered to waste our time to view and consider it."
0,lamer than FDR's legs,"this film is only enjoyable for the people from new orleans that are in it or have friends in it, and even then the amount of enjoyment derived is quite limited. not enough substance, way too drawn out, and somewhat boring... might be better if watched while under the influence (like many of the folks IN the film seem to be), but just a drag to watch sober.also, saying this film stars josh wink is a HUGE misnomer."
1,A Must-Read for Military Members,"Classics professor Hanson uses seven battles in recorded history to exemplify the characteristics of western values that make our military what it is today. Whether one uses this as merely an innovative way to string together events in military history or a celebration of western values and their victories, this is an enlightening and fascinating read. Packed with detail and analysis, this is a dense read but worth the effort. I recommend this for any member of the military who wants to better understand our history."
0,Not Good,"I just finished the book and I was disappointed. The realism of the plot, technology and the real-life type characters (that were hallmarks of his earlier books) have given way to story that is dumb. Not only are his books getting really fat --Tom: as a helpful hint, let an editor do some trimming-- but it is now populated by characters who are all super men, super dedicated and fighting to save the world on a just in time basis. While that formula may work for Robert Ludlum, it detracts from the believability that have made the earlier Clancy novels so entertaining, engrossing and keeps you eagerly waiting his next book."
0,Its not good,"This CD says :""by Celine Dion"" However, the one I received says ""these songs are recreations and are not performed by the original artist."" Look at other CD's."
0,Downgrade the average customer review rating,"According to the tv advertisement, this book promises cures for instant weight loss, cancer, pneumonia, the common cold, skin cancer, etc. Guess what? They don't exist. Not in this book, not anywhere in the world. To make a long story short, this book is a shameful disgrace. Buy it, and you WILL be sorry."
0,Poor instruction on proper form,"I'm experienced in yoga and was very suprised that the instructors would call out the name of a position and give no advice on proper technique. Not only is this a little dangerous, but it could prevent a novice from getting the full benefits of the workout. The instructor does the same with ballet and pilates positions, which I am less familiar with.So, it is an agressive workout but it might not be a good idea for someone who doesn't know proper form to use this tape."
1,Excellent Service!!,"My cousin bought this lava lamp for my daughter for Chrismas. When we received it, it was broken. I contacted the seller and they immediately sent us a new one, no questions asked. And we got it in time for Christmas! Can't beat that! I would diffinitely buy from here again."
1,Cute but not a favorite yet,"Purchased Stella for my daughter's 1 year birthday. HAD to have her since there seems to be a big hype about what a wonderful doll she is. Though my daughter does play with her, she doesn't seem to prefer her to the much cheaper dolls purchased at Target. In fact she prefers their pacis since they aren't flat and actually go into their mouths. She's 18 months now so maybe Stella will grow on her in the future. She is an adorable doll and very well made."
1,Wow,Placed this on the sides of my truck bed & lower frame of my Harley & I cannot believe how well they reflect light.
1,Amazing book,"As the authors say about entropy, it requires some intuitivity to understand this book. And I say as a person majored in physics this book is really amazing. I have never read such kind of a book before covering nearly all of life somehow. The very first times I had read the book I used to give lots of illustrations from it within my discussions with others in my department. Some thought I had gone too far with the book but the ones who read the book appreciated it as much as I did. The book requires an understanding of sciencetific thinking unfortunately."
0,Broke after only a week,This scale seemed to work great at first. Then after a week it was saying I weighed 50 pounds more or less than I actually do. After a few days of that it quit working completely (not due to low battery). I have not contacted the company yet but I hope to get a full refund.
1,Another winner from Krich...bring on the next one!,"As an avid fan of Krich and her complex characters, I was not disappointed in the latest tale of Detective Jesse Drake. Once again Jesse is faced with solving not just the murders that are part of her job - but the mysteries of her own spiritual journey and that of her family. The conflicts between good and evil, parent and child, society and the individual - this carefully crafted novel explores them all - and in the midst of a gripping mystery! After catching my breath at the surprise ending, I could feel the smile on my face as Krich carefully set down the tracks for the next challenge our heroine will face."
1,These shirts are so comfortable.,These are some of the most comfortable shirts around. I have several of them. I wear them as often as I can.
1,One great story,"Since I am from the town where the movie was filmed, I obviously had extra interest in the Storm of the Century. I was surprised, however, how good the movie and the screenplay actually were. After seeing the movie, I bought the book and could not put it down, even though I knew what was going to happen. It really grabs you, while you feel for the townspeople and decision they have to make. The ending is disturbing, which I suppose it what Stephen King is trying to accomplish. Overall, I would say this is a great tale, no matter what medium you experience it in."
0,Recon Customer Service,This light bar will not fit a 2011 GMC HD 3500 truck that has a factory light bar installed. The mounting holes will not line up. The light bar wiring is offset and will not line up with the factory wiring access hole. Although Recon lights look good they fill with condensation (I have had 3 sets). Contact with Recon has proven fruitless as they will not stand behind purchases made through Amazon.
0,Requires Many Coats Due to Lack of Pigment,"So bad I returned it. It was like clear paint with some pigment mixed in. (Yes, I shook it for 2 minutes before using). Would have taken 3 or 4 coats to do what Rustoleum spray paint does in 1 or 2 coats. Horrible.Maybe I just got a bad can. In that case, 1-star for feeble quality control. A paint company should know better."
1,First Class Harry!,"Kenneth Branagh does an absolutely BRILLIANT job of bringing Shakespeare to the screen in this film. It's largely true to the script, and leaves in the treason of British soldiers that the government forced Olivier to cut in 1944. Not having to boost a nation's morale as Olivier's version did, and spurred on by Branagh's take on things, this film depicts a much more realistic image of war. Additionally due to different circumstances the French are portrayed as quite a bit more formiddable enemies than Olivier's version. However while Branagh rarely touches Shakepeare's words, it is probable the French were lampooned in the Bard's day. It's an odd mix as Shakespeare was obviously (from the script) telling a factually slanted story, however Branagh sobers it up while still maintaing a sense of glory and the promise of a bold new leader. It's a wonderful interpretation!"
1,"Great for walking support, and more!","Our daughter used this for balance when beginning to walk, and now that she walks independently, she still pushes it around! She loves the telephone feature, and will sit quietly pushing the buttons and using the other features. The lights, sounds and music are cheerful and hold her attention. The activity portion also detaches from the walker, so your child can play with it flat on the floor."

0,Absolutely Pathetic,"You figured the guys at Verant would have at least tested this buggy piece of garbage. But, as it is, their motto is ""your in our world now."" and I suppose the rest of that statement ought to read; ""and if you don't like it, then tuff..."" Horrible customer service and a condescending, and almost disdainful regard for their ""customers"", is par for the course for these clowns. I would strongly recommend this tittle for those with strong masochistic tendencies."
1,Appreciate family,"I really enjoyed this book. I do not agree with the 2 & 3 star reviews!! This book is about appreciating your family history. It is based on a Jewish family and their struggles, but you do not have to be Jewish to love this book. I am a ""sucker"" for books with love of family and faith--- and adding a little romance never hurt anything!"

1,Montana Sky,"Loved watching the movie. Enjoyed the scenery and the story lines. Will watch the movie again. The back drop of the movie, with the wide open spaces of the ranch are great. Loved the interction of the main characters. In the end love finds all of the women of Mercy Ranch."
0,A Little Too Self-Indulgent,"I used to enjoy Clive Cussler's novels; that is, until hestarted inserting himself into the story lines. Each time Dirk at some point has to take a break in his adventure to meet with some mysterious hermit-like fellow (Cussler) who just happens to be loaded with crucial information about the local area. In this book Cussler writes himself into the story line as the ""Bayou Kid""-- an old timer who knows every nook and cranny of the Mississippi swamp Dirk must investigate and who just happens to have a sophisticated and well-appointed undercover swamp boat (complete with comic relief guard dog) for Dirk and his lady de jure to borrow for his mission. Yawn! Cussler's habit of writing himself into the plot may have been cute the first time he did it, but at this point it's become downright annoying. Let Cussler have his fantasies--and his books--for I shall not subsidize him any longer."

0,"mine's dead---just like many, many others","Mine was great while it lasted. It was hard to set up and occasionally didn't play well with cordless phones, but otherwise it was a great way to play iTunes on my stereo (that's what it was used for, exclusively). But yesterday it suddenly died without warning. Do a little searching on Google and you will see that there are literally hundreds if not thousands of cases where these things are dying after 1-2 years of operation. There is even a huge thread on the topic on Apple's own support forums."
1,Wonderful Breakaway from plot architypes,"A stand-alone novel in the FR Harper series. I loved thedescriptions of the frozen environment; some of the best I've read inany novel (this coming from someone who lives in the snow). The book breaks away from conventional ""good vs. evil"", blurring the lines, showing both sides of the battle with intriguing characters. Don't expect a cliff-hanging plotline, but do expect a fresh look and new take on the way characters and the overall book is portrayed as compared ot other FR novels. My only complaint is that there hasn't been a sequel written (yet - knock on wood)."
0,Incompatible with HP scanner software,"The camera works reasonably well for its price; however, the software it comes with for recognizing the camera when plugged into your computer via the serial port fails to work properly if your computer has scanner software installed. Polariod tech support identified this as a potential problem when I couldn't get the Izone software to recognize the camera. After uninstalling the (HP) scanner software the Izone software did recognize the camera and downloaded the digital images as advertised.Polariod tech support suggested that reinstalling the HP scanner software after the IZone software was installed would solve the problem. It did not. Anyone with scanner software installed are likely to run into this problem which is not covered in the IZone trouble shooting guide. If you don't have a scanner this might be the gift to get for the child who wants a camera otherwise skip it."
1,A much underrated album,"Made after a long hiatus in which other groups like Leftfield and Underworld made up and surpassed the ground which 808 State had made with early albums like 'Ex:el' and 'Gorgeous'.The album is very soft and pleasing sounding, apart from the harsh rhythms and rolling beat of 'Bond' with Soul Coughing's Matt Doughty's aggressive vocals, and also final track 'Banacheq' which is a breakbeat track full of squalls and noise.But on tracks like 'Bird' and 'Black Dartangnon' the saxophone of Graham Massey comes to the fore and has a huge, soothing effect and lends the album a more mature feel, which came as a refreshment in an age which was dominated by lager, lager, lager!"
1,Gun Case from Plano,"Case worked out very well, I will use Plano products again.Plano products have my needs for over 50years ,an outstanding line."
0,Sonic abomination,"Here it is.The horror.The sonic abomination.The hell spawn that was released by Anka onto AM radio in 1974 and makes us envy the deaf today.Yes, I am speaking of Paul Anka & Odia Coates duet ""(You're) Having My Baby.""Upon Anka's release of this atrocity, William Shatner need never fear again that his ""Mr. Tambourine Man"" cover will go down in history as the world's worst song.Despite his other achievements, Anka buried his credibility with this repulsive treacle. Even Frank Sinatra's ""Mama Will Bark"" has a redeeming note in it, unbearably absent from Anka's sonic turd. It manages to combine the worst features of Captain & Tennille's ""Muskrat Love"" and the base carnality of any song by Mr. Meat Loaf.Perhaps George Orwell's prophetic ""memory holes"" cannot arrive soon enough. Would that we had them now and could confine every copy of this album to the flames, and had the cheap gin to wash the memory of ever hearing it from our damaged grey sludge."
0,Doesn't hold a Candle to the Original,"What a let down. I just hope the movie is not as weak as this offereing. Just never takes off. The original Broadway recording has spark and fire. This one sizzles every now and then. The vocals (with a notable exception) and the muscians are very good, but they just don't soar. It is like they are holding back. The pacing is also a little slower. The biggest distraction in this cd are the vocals of Anthony Rapp. This guy can sing, but do we really have to hear him gulp for air before every phrase? After a few listens I just couldn't stand it. Usually they will edit that out of a recording. Can't figure out why this got through or why he doesn't have better breath control by this stage of his career.Love the music, love the show, but am really dissappointed with this cd. It will be on my shelf, and the original will come off and be played when I want to listen to the music."

1,Debussy - Music for Oboe and Harp,CD received promptly and in good condition. Enjoy harp music and enjoy Debussy. Music archives contain many CD's of harp music which is soothing and relaxing.
1,"""Awakenings"" is an incredible gift to the planet!!","Every so often, I discover a work from a modern composer that reminds me of why I listen to music in the first place. ""Awakenings"" is such an album.Composer Joseph Curiale has proven to me that he is, and will continue to be, a world class artist for the new Millennium. Each composition, with the aid of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, has been sweetly and thunderously performed with great precision and care under Curiale's baton. I will be listening to this CD for years to come. And I very much look forward to his next release.I strongly recommend ""Awakenings"""
1,An Incredible Artist who needs more air-time!,"Sing (If you want it) is an excellent album. Omar is an outstanding vocalist who has his own style that works well in today's cookie-cutter world of music. Omar's music is smooth, yet edgy. This is his best work yet. This says a lot since I have all of his albums. I will continue to be a fan of this multi-talanted artist."

1,Good pen!,This pen is very good and it has a nice and cushin felling to it and it ia worth the price get it.
1,Too Long to Remember,"Kouzes and Posner offer wonderful information but way, way too much of it. They should rewrite this book, chapter by chapter, making each chapter one book. I recently read ""To Lead is to Empower"" by Shar McBee, where she presents profound and useful information about leadership in a way that busy executives like me can use. Truth is simple."
0,This design could use some fixing....,"This coffee maker makes good coffee, however it does have a few major glitches.If you do not set the pot back exactly in the right spot it will leak, and lets face it, how many of us are half asleep when getting our first cup (and sometimes our second)? A mess is NOT a good way to start a day!The next problem I found was the spout. It will pour out all over the floor if you tip it just a smidge to fast (again, most of us are half asleep). I have poured it all over the floor even when I was awake.The last problem I found with it was that the filters are hard to find. When you find and replace them you have to unplug the coffee maker and reset everything to get the filter light to turn off."
0,not recommended,"I ordered these and they rusted out couple of uses. Called the company and they said that I wasn't drying them properly and they would send a cleaner that would take the rust away. Well, I was drying them throughly. After several calls to the company; that NO cleaner had arrived. Months later, they sent me a new set of same knives. They set unopened. The are heavy for arthritis people; and handle is made larger for a man. Not comfortable in the hand; even though they are grooved for fingers."
1,Solid guide for the non-specialist,"The NIBC series is intended to give the generalist reader a good sense of the book and of current scholarship. An educated layperson or non-Christian could read this with profit. Soards keeps the technical matters of lexicography, archaeology and grammar to endnotes. In the text itself he gives a careful, if conventional, verse-by-verse commentary. This volume surpasses Morris in the Tyndale series."
1,Otters Jug Band Xmas,I watched this movie every Christmas Holiday. I'm so glad I found it again. Love it!
0,Stone Fox,The book I am reviewing is called Stone Fox written by John Reynold Gardiner. I recommend this story because it's great. The story is about a little boy named Willy who is determined to keep his and his grandfather's farm and to give his sick grandfather a reason to live. Willy then enters a race so he can raise money to keep his farm. I think this book is a great book.
0,delivered broken,"This hook was exactly what we needed on our boat. first was delivered broken with the hook broken off. Returned and requested another one. ( very easy through Amazon.) Second one was delivered worse than the first with the hook broken, and bent up. Very disappointed. Will have to find something else."
0,Aeon Flux has a strange look & feel but too serious and hard,"The character of Aeon Flux in this science-fiction future drama has such a serious and displeased look on her face most of the time that one can hardly see anything human going on there.They should have lightened up a bit just to make the character alittle more accessible. It would have made a big difference.Simply put, the basic attitude of the movie was ill-humored and uptight for lack of any humor or real heart to speak of. This movie is mostly style and in the realm of the mental."
0,Agree with majority,"I have to agree with the majority of the the reviewers on this one. I ended up buying 2 sets of the original DVD's when they came out. This time, I will wait for the extended version. Interesting though...I came on line to check prices against Futureshop (upon release will be $49 CDN) but these reviews have alerted me to this issue and I def won't buy the april release."
1,Great CD!,"As a big fan of Creed, I recommend this CD to anyone else who likes them! They are still rocking! It is right up there with their previous two! I also recommend catching them on tour this year. I was at the tour kick-off in Atlanta... Great show!"
0,Ow,"Ow. Owowowowow. Do Not Mistake These for actual orthotics made for your unique feet. In fact, these I found to be painful and counter-productive. I bought these as a stop-gap to actual orthotics to straighten out my knees and the Walk Fits radically affected my gait, stride and shape on my foot. The podiatrist I finally got to see scolded me for making my orthotics a much more expensive proposition by first wearing a non-specific insole that did not address my feet, but rather was a commercial One Size Fits All.I'd be very very careful about putting these in your shoes."
0,Could have been a great magazine article,"I just finished this book and was curious to see how others had reviewed it because I found it so bad that it's hard to believe that it was published. Frankly, I am shocked that it received such positive reviews. It is extremely repetitive and basically just commonsense. This book would have made a great magazine article entitled ""3 Tips for Better Time Management--Prioritize, Prioritize, Prioritize"". The book consists of 35 very short chapters, so no idea is really developed. Some of the advice was laughable, like ""buy lots of wastebaskets"" and ""wear seatbelts"". I paid a dollar for this book at Dollar Tree, but I will never get the time that I spent reading it back."

1,freedom child is a hit!!!,this cd provided us hours of listening pleasure on a long road trip to nova scotia canada......both my partner and myself became avid fans of every song on the cd.......my dearest wish before i go to the great beyond is to see billy joe shaver live!........i have a friend in austin to visit so perhaps at that time.......what a performer as well as i have seen him live on the don imus show and that is where the love story for me began......my boyfriend is even a little jealous tho he also loves each song......BUY IT!!!
1,LOVE THIS PATTERN,"I saw this in [a local store] and fell in love with it. Looks good in the bag, but 100% better in the crib with the accesories. It has to be seen on display in the actual crib. The mobile is also adorable!! I reccomend it to anyone that has a baby girl. The lavender, pink and white are wonderful combinations. I love it! Love it! Love it!!!!!!!!!"
1,A classic oscar winning thriller!!!!!!,"I first seen this movie on Starz, and thought that this was a great movie. Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins gave great performances that were worth the oscars they won that year. It kept me at the edge of my seat the whole time, especially the part where Clarice is in the dark with Buffalo Bill behind her wearing a pair of night vision goggles. Anthony Hopkins' performance as Hannibal Lecter was haunting, especially the part where he talks about eating the census taker's liver. A very excellent thriller."
1,Picnic,"Yeah, you'd better pack a lunch when you settle in to read this one. While covering a great deal of information, the verbage is NOT for a starting player."
1,Masterpiece,"The Sunbird is one of the best books I've ever read. I listened to it on tape on an auto trip from Florida to Massachusetts, and travel time has never flown by so quickly. The story is split between modern times and the era of the lost city in a most intriguing way, and I commend it to anyone. Wilbur Smith's best work."
0,"an outdated chart, I regreted to order.","Among the 10+ cross stitch books I owned, this Anne Orr's charted designs is the worst printed one. The papers are yellowish, the print is black and white. Overall, this book cannot attract or arouse my interest on starting any project. I regreted to order."
1,Acura RL 2005,"Acura's have these funky wipers and I have ordered a couple that say they fit the Acura and do not. I looked at a blog for the Acura and one guy there swore by the PIAA wipers for the Acura. Remember PIAA 94048 and PIAA 94070.I have a 19"" and a 24"" and the blades are fitted by removing the arm cover and removing the two screws that hold the wiper blade holder onto the wiper arm. Recommended you use a cordless impact screw driver as these screws are on tight!!! Once removed, you simply unclip the old wiper bladesd and insert the new blades and reverse the process to reinstall.One thing I noticed with these blades is zero chatter on the window. With non-silicone wipers, there is a little chatter as they wear in and a lot of chatter when they are worn out. These wipers were absolutely smooth and my windshield in winter mode or summer mode (if you own an RL, you'll know) work flawlessly.Worth the extra few bucks and Prime delivery was fast (2 days)."
1,Learn QiGong,Qi (or Chi) Gong is a great way to exercise to control breathing and to relax and this video has helped me learn it to get those benefits with lessons that make it easy to understand.I definately feel more relaxed and giving myself some time to do these exercises is now something I am getting into the habit of doing now for the last couple of months. I am also gaining some flexibility and strength. Hugging The Tree (one of the extra routines in addition to the 8 Pieces) has helped make my upper body stronger.
0,Beneath the Mississippi,"I wish I had read the other reviews before this. I made it through half of the movie- I was watching it on headphones while everyone else played a game. I kept making so many ""omg this movie is so bad"" noises that kids were coming over to check it out and laugh at it also. I have no idea what was going on, the film was really hard to see and to hear- and it had no plot. I thought it was a documentary- I still don't know what it was! I sure hope they just remove this movie as a choice."
1,So easy to assemble & secure!,"We received this bike stand recently and assembled it last night in our garage. It was up & secured to the wall (which is optional) in about 5 minutes, including the time it took to find the power-drill! Our bikes are now nicely secured and off the ground. Great buy!!"
0,"Does not provide what it says it does, not recomended but some use",Material is an update for experienced users not for newbies. No information on how to structure the rograms to get the smooth transitions shown nor on how to get any real help. Definately needs more information on Premere. The material is well and entertaingly presented but doesn't really address enough indepth inforamation for the experienced user or enough basic information for a new user.
1,Lucky Dog Kennel,"Great product that was easy to assemble. I use it in a climate controlled garage for my boarding business, and the dogs love it. They enter easily and have plenty of room to move around. The top gives it the den feeling that dogs love."
1,Yes she can sing! A great upbeat Christmas CD!,"Hilary Duff can Sing! I Don't know where those two negative reviews came from, but obviously they didn't listen to this CD.I bought this CD for my 11 year old daughter for her birthday and we both love it! It'll put you in the Holiday mood! So if you're a Lizzie McGuire fan, Buy it! And if not! This is a great Holiday mood booster! Buy it!"
1,My daughter LOVES the double sides!!!,I bought this last year for my daughter. She's still using it to this day. The fabric is tough cause TRUST ME my 3 girls are rough and none of the seams have broke. My daughter can't get enough of the different face on each side. She always flips her pillow over when it's bedtime... priceless.
0,Constant Headache,"Constant headache. This printer is supposed to do so many things - fax, scan, copy, print photos, etc. I've completely given up on using this as anything but a basic click and print machine. If only it would even work reliably for that!"
0,Beware,"This isn't music. If you want something very different, this might be for you. There is no rhyme or reason to this album, just a bunch of different sounds thrown together."
0,"Not really for coffee, either.","I have owned this grinder for about three years and this morning I lost my temper with it and went online to Amazon and ordered a different grinder. I've had no problems with its breaking or malfunctioning but it's impossible to clean to my satisfaction. It's also difficult to add beans without my ending up chasing them all over the kitchen floor. In addition, you have to estimate the grinding time and, if you're not very careful, you end up with bitter coffee no matter how high in quality your coffee beans are. Anyone want a used grinder?"
1,Nice and user-friendly.,"Chileans must be happy to have such a nice, well-organised bird guide: many countries lack one. The illustrations are good: I particularly like the seabird plates (which also show the birds sat on the water), and have uploaded one to give you some idea. Many of the seabirds ocurring off Chile have large global ranges and thus this book can be of use further afield. The brief text is useful and geared to quick ID, and there are handy range maps."
0,Garbage,"Really very boring and campy - I can't bear to listen and wish I could return it. In fact all of the Disney Lullabuys and children's songs were downright horrible. Stick with Baby Einstein, Rock a Bye Baby and Just for Kids - Curious George is great too"
1,Best book I've ever read-Honestly,"I admire Drew's truthfulness, even though it does offend people. I got this book because I wanted to learn more about Drew and his feelings on many things like showbiz, tabloids, and other things stars deal with. However, he also suprised me by writing about ""average guy"" things like beer,gambling, big screen T.V.'s, Mardi Gras, and strip clubs. I am glad Drew didn't get too caught up in stardom and forget his average guy traits, and this book proves he didn't. If you are unsure if this book will offend you, read some of the short stories. Those would probably be the worst part of the book, vulgarity wise. I don't feel offended by them, because I know these things happen to people. I certainly don't think of Drew as a sleaze or something because he made up stories like these, I believe he just wanted to show people that stars do have problems."
0,Buyer Beware!!! Zero Stars LEAKS,"If I could give something a negative star I would definately give this a ton of negative stars (I had to give it at least one star and it does not deserve that even). IT LEAKS EVERY TIME I USE IT!!! It is such a poor design I can't beleive it made it this far. Sure it makes good tea but . . . when more than half of it ends up on the counter it is not worth making tea in. I have given it several tries. I even tried tieing the pitcher to the maker and it still leaked. It leaks right where the tea comes out and is supposed to go into the pitcher . . . but for some reason the tea just runs down the side of the maker. It does not matter how snug you get the pitcher to the maker, it still ends up a huge mess all over the counter. I am off to buy a new one today. Good thing that one was a gift."
1,But where's adam beach and graham greene,I bought the movie because I like the native american actors Means and Beach and greene. Adam Beach and Graham Greene are listed on the dvd case as being in the movie. But they never appeared. Does anyone know why?By the way the movie was pretty good and scenery fantastic.
1,Leadership is about action,"Is it possible to be a leader without having the title of ""manager"" or ""supervisor""? Of course, and people are doing it everyday. Wonder what makes a leader? How is that the assistant can seem to be more of a leader than the CEO?A lot of people go through their careers thinking that in order to be successful; they have to be the boss. There are plenty of managers who would never be considered to be a leader by their staff. There is more to being a leader than ""managing.""It's more then just talking about it. Leadership is action!!!! Each chapter of the book contains action points for you to develop into the best leader you can be."
1,Get more life out of a bar of soap,"This simple design works for keeping a bar of soap from getting mushy and works nicely as a dish sponge holder. For soaps, it works great on the vanity counter where the soap does not get as wet. In the shower, the shelf where my soap holder sits on gets pretty wet. When the wet soap dries, soap does get stuck on the prongs. But it does extend the life. These holders do have a strong plastic-y smell which has not gone away after a month of use."
1,work the way I wanted,shipped two days earlier.using it on my blonde hair two times a week so the orange tints will not showed. work great for me .
0,disappointing,"Unfortunately I ordered this before the other DVD with Popp, Randova, Pso and Altrichter (from Product Details) or Popp, Randova, Protschka and Mikules (from the cover) was released. Would that I had waited another week or two,This is a recording from 1988 and its age shows with less than stellar audio and frequent camera cuts. Josef Protschka is the best of the soloists. Gabriella Benackova seems to be having an off night. The other two soloists were undistinguished, to be as charitable as I can. The chorus and orchestra might have sounded better if the DVD had been remastered.I am sure that the new release will be much better. I would hate to think that it could be worse."
0,Don't waste your money!,"Just a poor immitation of Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. Uninspiring music, vocals and her whole image is a cheap immitation of the other successful teen divas."
1,Good product,"I have 2 Rabbit BoiGS filters in my apartments for a year now. They works pretty well and the volume of dust and dirt in my house reduces 2 or something. Since old filters work for 1 year already, I decided to replace them. New one woks as good as the previous one."
1,DARN GOOD! WORDS CAN NOT SAY ENOUGH!!,"Wow!You really did some serious damage by pulling this one off! I thoroughly enjoyed this novel! Your imagination took your characters and molded creative divas, players, and insensitive player haters, but yet you allowed the p-layer to be exposed to a life lesson! Its a thin line between love and hate! My book club has rated you the top notch new writer to enter the writing arean! Anxiously awaiting your next book!!!"
0,The taste is not what I expected,"It does not taste like chipotle. I do like spicy foods, but the hot spicy flavor was a bit one-dimentional, in other words, there was no depth to the taste. I could replicate the same flavor by just adding a bunch of crushed chili peppers into a plain can of tuna."
1,very cool edition of a very cool movie,"always loved the matrix movie and this copy is pretty cool not for just the extras but bc the case is actully a book filled with pics and storys about the movie, and for the price u cant go wrong"
1,Another good one!,"I've enjoyed reading Mary Higgins Clark mysteries for years, and this one was no exception. I would recommend it for any fan of hers. Thanks."
1,Above Average,"I've enjoyed Madden since the days of Super Nintendo....This yeasr madden was good but not great...the precision passing, does take some time to get used to, but it fits into my ""spread em"" type offense quite well....One major negative I have about this game is that, in dynasty mode, it seems as if every player's rating goes up. Whether the athlete sits the bench or not they go up. As you can expect, this causes major cap problems. Further, any guy who you do play (especially a Safety) goes up. Therefore, if you draft a Strong Safety in the 7th round, give him 3 years and he will be a 90. At one point, about 15 years into my franchise. There was only 1 QB ( the one on my team) in the 90s, whereas EVERY strong and free safety was at least a 92 rating. Despite this negative I still play the game constantly because it is quite addicting."
0,Doesn't work half the time,"This litter box is a good idea, but the bugs still need to be worked out. The litter sticks to the box most of the time, which prevents the rake from cleaning the box. In the end, most of the time I have to still clean out the litter by hand, completely defeating the purpose of even having the thing. In addition, the motor is really loud, and when it encounters an obstacle (i.e. clumped up litter sticking to the box) it makes three passes before finally shutting down and blinking the light that shows me that the box has yet again failed to perform. I even have to shut off the box at night. Otherwise I'll be woken up by the sound of the rake going back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. Better to wait for the next model, which hopefully will be more advanced than this one."
1,A great resource and entertainment.,"In this book one is taken aback by the quality of the look a likes that the author uses, then the amazing generosity of information for the aspiring performer to get into this surreal business. It is both entertaining & educational, how often do you get that?"
1,2008 Frontier antenna adapter harness,"Harness worked well, once I figured out that the second wire had no purpose. No instructions with the harness, so no way of figuring out the dummy wire."
1,Love it!,Awesome product! It was just as described and worth the investment. You really only have to buy them one time! Very easy to expand as needed.
1,One of my favorite movies,I was a little disappointed that the food scene everyone raved about was not all that good. But since this is one of my favorite movies I got over that quickly. Steven Martin and John Candy are absolutely hilarious.
0,Feast or Famine,"If you can get Norton Ghost to work on your machine, then the software can make a cloned image of your hard drive for quick restore. However, notice the word ""IF"". Instructions for using Ghost are not straight forward. Creating a sucessful clone can be a real challenge. Additionally, there is no try before you buy option, so if Ghost doesn't work with your system, you are out of luck. I've had much more success with a program called Drivebackup from Newtek, Inc (NTI). With Drivebackup, I easily made a self-booting image copy clone of my Windows XP laptop computer for emergency purposes. Plus, NTI's website has a trial download option so you can make sure their program works on your machine before purchasing."
1,Great content,"Roxette has been one of my favorite bands. All the hits are here. My only complaint is that the aspect ratio is 4:3. If it was widescreen, I would have given it a 5."
0,Astonishingly noisy for such a weak vacuum,"Or, astonishingly weak for such a noisy vacuum.I bought this to replace a Black & Decker 'Collector' whose motor had burned out. Big mistake. While the brush part spins okay and picks up lightweight debris (lint and paper), the hose extension has very little suction. Not recommended."
0,AWFUL!!! FALSE ADVERTISING!!,The book isn't the one in the picture or the one you can view. It is a MINIATURE ADDITION. It only has a few pages and minimal information. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!
1,Provides excellent knowledge about Tibetan Medicine,"ITem was shipped new and arrived in excellent condition. DVD provides a beginning knowledge about the almost lost art regarding Tibetan Medicine. As indicated in the DVD, there are very few doctors that still retain this knowledge and practice. Excellent overview but it is all in subtitles and obtaining any of the medicines/herbs seems as though it would be difficult. They take a wholistic approach and specialize the medicines for the person. You would need to go to India to get a diagnosis regarding your condition. Too bad it is not closer."
1,One of our favorites!,"Our one year old loves this movie! Carly Simon does a wonderful job singing. Although my husband and I catch ourselves humming the songs throughout the day, the songs are really good! We used to put it on just long enough for her to sit still so we can change her or do a quick chore. She's slowly losing interest as she has become a toddler, but we enjoyed this movie. Yes, there is a brief moment where the characters are in trouble, but they recover quickly. Its not that terrifying and its not a bad thing to introduce that there are dangerous situations out there! There are a lot of little lessons in the movie such as meeting new people and not to judge them by their looks and that anyone can help with a project, no matter how small the task may be. This movie will be in our collection for a long time!"
1,Heavenly Hilarity Hits Home,"The audio version of this book delighted me tremendously. I found myself laughing out loud. Not only is the story a funny satire on the state of the art in self-help but on the ancient forms of ""holy"" self help, with a little divine intervention, as well. Perhaps my Catholic past and familiarity with those who serve added a solid base for appreciating the humor, satire and fun of the work. Two colleagues thoroughly enjoyed the audio version. One felt a bit grief-struck when the tapes came to an end; the other said he laughed and laughed and found the whole story delightful."
1,Amusing and clever,"I borrowed my daughter's car, and the CD in the player was poised on ""Bridges and Balloons""! I had to laugh. And I had to hit the ""Repeat"" button, because I wanted to decipher the lyrics. I still haven't figured them all out, I'm having fun trying. As others have said before, her voice grows on you. Her playing is charming. And her lyrics are fun and clever and intriguing. I've played it for friends, and they've had to laugh, too. No, she'll never be mainstream, but she'll have a loyal following..."
0,Big waste of money,"This is one of the worst toys I have ever purchased. Luckily I got it on sale so I was only out $20 but even at that I was angry by the poor quality of it. The hair is impossible to get a comb thru. It was just a big ball of fuzz in the back when we took it out of the box and it still is. There was no way we could make it look good. The ""make up"" and ""nail polish"" changing colors did not work nearly as well as it should have. Just a piece of junk."
1,Dancing With Redemption and Drowning is Desire,"The first African American serial novel written by ten authors detailing the erotic journey of a young man's quest for redemption. With different writing styles, this tapestry of fiction unfolds without a hitch. Each author wrote their own chapter with Sekou writing the first and last.When Butterflies Kiss is loaded with redemption and desire. It is the story of a young man coming of age and finding his own place in the world. The first of ten authors begins the story with Dante, a poet who has more than one woman in his life and many desires.Butterflies are very mysterious critters, imagining them kissing is tough. The correlation between Dante's struggle with life and the butterflies is truly a work of art."
0,Do not buy the Troy-Bilt TB90BC,"Do not buy this trimmer. I have been struggling with it for 2 years. I takes forever to start, does not idle, uses a lot of gas I also brought it in for repair. They charged me $40. and told me that it was not worth fixing. I wish I had returned it. I only gave it one star because that was the only way I could post this comment"
0,Amazon STILL shipping non-us product!!,"The one star rating is against Amazon here, not the product. Well, it seems that Amazon has not, and likely will not fix the issue with shipping non-us product and fails to tell the consumer it is doing so! To me, this is a breach of trust to the consumer. I have bought numerous Canon products from Amazon with no issues till now. After speaking to 2 customer service reps, who insisted the problem was Canon's, not Amazon, I have now lost faith in Amazon. They swore it is Canon who is supplying them these non-us parts to sell and Amazon is just doing what Canon wants..... They seriously need to fix this problem or inform the consumer on their use of non-us product and price it accordingly."
1,Extremely Cool Film!,"For Lovecraft mavens, it doesn't get a lot better than this! Made by serious fans as a labor of love, this film faithfully translates a virtually untranslatable story to the screen. The central conceit - making a film in the style of the era when the story was first published - is brilliant, and while the film's (extremely) low-budget edges certainly show, they lend a charm to the whole undertaking. At 47 minutes, it never wears out its welcome and as a silent film, it captures the feel of the original story in ways that a lot of dialogue simply wouldn't have. This is a delightful romp, if that word can truly be applied to an author whose work virtually defines the idea of ""dread."" For any Lovecraft fans, this is an absolute must-see!"
1,Excellent book!,This is a beautiful combination of life with certain death or a second chance at a New life that is out of this world.
1,The diva is for real,"I love it! One fine dandy piece of candy that lavay is and she can sing too. What i like to do is sit back in my easy chair and drink cognac, last night i did it to lavay and her skillet lickers, sure it makes me want to dance but I have a bad hip and it wouldnt be to safe after all that cognac. Close your eyes and you want to snuggle up to gee baby aint i good to you, I want to take honey pie accross the dance floor and have her blow me a fat note, often i had to interrupt my fantasies and be amazed at just how good these guys can play. I'm a gamblin man, I like Atlantic city, if lavay was a poker hand I'd bet all my chips on her, she's a winner and this CD is a keeper."
1,READ IT!,"Hi all, I just completed Julie Kenner's ""The Cat's Fancy"". It is a contemperary. Maggie ""the cat"" is in love with her owner Nickolas. So what is a kitty to do? Well, in Maggies case, talk to the old Tom. Mistic one eyed cat that he is, Maggie gets to be human for one week. But she has to get Nick to say the three magic words. This won't be difficult, or will it? I found this to be a laugh out loud story. Maggie is just so much cat. Nick is a lawyer, hmmm, aren't they the stodgy type?I deffinately reccomend this book.Brenna"
1,Great for small jobs.,"They don't open very wide, as discribed, but they are easy to use and hold well. I haven't had them long, so I don't know how well they hold up. They seem to be made fairly well and I think they are going to be a good buy for the price. I use them mostly for art and sewing projects, or to hold small items in place when I need a third arm. If this is what you are looking for, they work well and are worth the price."
0,Presents abridged versions of other reviews,"This book merely presents abridged versions of other reviews on nanotechnology. For example, the chapter on self-assembly misses most if not all if the initial discoveries and describes second and third generation reports that merely duplicate the concepts with new chemical building blocks. If one reads the reviews cited at the end of the chapters one will get a better view of the respective topics."
0,I'M NOT A FAN,I thinks she can't sing and how ugly she looks. She just screams about her damm boring life on every song. You're no Madonna okay get it Mary J. Don't buy this crappy album.
1,Thorough and Well Done,"I've been involved in tracking off and on for about 10 years now. I thought it would be fun to swap from SAR style trailing/tracking to the AKC sport instead. Since I have a pretty strong background in the sport, I wanted to know the nuances of AKC style and what was required for the TD/TDX title as well as looking at various tracking programs people had developed.There are several old and new books that are recommended by trainers when you start out tracking and after reviewing them all, this is my favorite book of them. I blends all the things I preferred in the different books into one simple and easy to follow program that helps you understand in plain terms why and what you should be doing. Within a week, I had a dog doing the 100 yard tracks confidently and happily.If you only want one tracking book, I recommend this one!"
1,This is a great book!!!,"This story about Jimmy and his father who escaped from prison is great. It proves that even though you haven't seen someone for years, you can still be friends with that person."
0,Look further before buying,"Keep looking! this little crap camera is so cheap looking and feeling that everytime i carry this around, the batteries are always missing because the battery door has become dis lodged.Lets not even start with the amount of dollars you will be throwing down the pooper in replacement batteries. (makes you question why you didn't get the higher priced cameras?!)The advertised 4.1 megapixels is a flat out lie. i have contacted Target Inc. directly to notify them of a potencial false advertising claim by shoppers. I have extensive photography training and this camera at best is about a 1.2 megapix- at best.."
0,I'm going back to Braun!,"I owned a Braun shaver prior to this one, but thought that I would give Remington a try. The $40 Braun gave a much closer and comfortable shave then my ""now for sale"" MS3-2700. On top of a closer shave with the Braun I was not forced to replace the foil after 4 months of use. Try it if you want, but I would not recommend this product. Want to buy mine? :)"
0,Heat: 4 stars; Light: 2 stars,"The debate that takes place in this book consists of two professional apologists talking past each other.Or, to be fair to James White, it consists of one apologist trying to have a constructive debate with another apologist who doesn't seem to be listening.If you are hoping to be persuaded by the best arguments that each position (Calvinism/non-Calvinism) has to offer, you may want to keep looking.On the other hand, if you are looking for a handy reference on what a poor debate looks like in print, by all means, rush out and buy the book. You will not be disappointed."
1,I love this book so much!,it's a great book and i recommend it to anyone in high school or who is about to be in it.
0,broken plastig drive gears,"The plastic!! gear that rotates the cutters is broken and no replacement is available. I would expect a very expensive pencil sharpener such as this to literally last forever, or at least a few years. At the very least, it should have rugged parts.I found out that no replacement parts are available due to ""lack of demand."" Also found out it has a 2 year warranty. call their warranty number and it explains that you have to fax in Model #, shipping address, Proof of date of purchase, and description of failure. Fax to Danielle at 800-741-6046.hope this helps."
0,Read the fine print,"I purchased this item to give as a gift since my friend was going on a European cruise. I thought it would be a useful gift. When I received it the yearly calendars in the book were dated 1996, 1997, and 1998. I couldn't give this to my friend...the calendars would have been no use to her and she would have thought why would she give me such an outdated item. When I inquired to the store why they would even sell an item that was so outdated they said I should have read the entire selling page....copyright 1996. I never realized there would be calendars in it from 14 years ago. I was also blindsided by all of the great reviews. How could the other reviewers rave about a book that is so outdated. Make sure the copyright is current before purchasing this item (especially if you are giving it as a gift)."
0,Gauchos are not chilean,"This is just to correct a gross mistake from one of the other reviewers. Gauchos are the archetypical argentine country men, not chilean. and Patagonia is argentinean in more than 90% of its extension.Gaucho literature is almost exclusively argentinian. An obligatory introduction to the world of gauchos is José Hernández' Martin Fierro. See this book first to get a glance at the gaucho's rough life before embarking in a second-hand misleading historiography."
1,Ed Harris is phenominal in this role,"Ed Harris give a very powerful performance as Jackson Pollack.The supporting cast is outstanding and the film does a very good job of evoking the feel of the time period through scenery, costumes and automobiles. The film captures the dark side of Pollack as he struggles with his many demons. It is not a ""feel good"" movies by any means, but should not be missed especially by those interested in the world of modern art in America in the mid-twentieth century."
1,PRESENTS FOR THE NIECES,I PURCHASED THIS GIFT FOR MY NIECE AND FOUND MYSELF PLAYING IT FOR HOURS. MY NIECE IS 4 YEARS OLD AND BEGGED ME FOR A GAME BOY AFTER I BOUGHT ONE FOR HER 6 YEAR OLD SISTER LAST YEAR. IT'S A GREAT GIFT BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY ACCESSORIES YOU HAVE STUFF TO BUY FOR THE NEXT HOLIDAY
0,T31 Superior to WearLink31,"My wife and I have gone through 4 (2 each) Wearlink31's in the last 18 months. The Wearlinks work well for the first few months, then produces inconsistent readings...replacing the battery does not help. Our original T31's lasted four years with frequent use (4-5 times a week). Going back to the old but much better T31 model."
0,don't buy this,Don't bother purchasing this product. It does not work at all. Unless you have baby fine hair... I can't imagine it working for anyone on any body part.
0,Basic - perhaps too basic.,"This kids book does an adequate job of introducing the relationships in a traditional nuclear family. It includes grandparents, uncles, aunts, and cousins but stops there. It doesn't extend beyond one generation of ancestors nor does it deal with non-traditional families.It does provide an example of a nice family tree project that a child can create.""Who's Who In My Family?"" by Loreen Leedy gives a child a more well-rounded introduction to the relationships in a family tree."
0,Trash/garbage. A waste of money.,When putting on this rainsuit the zippers keep getting stuck and you have to try serveral times before you can completely zip it. After a downpour I found my pants around my waistline and crotch area soaked.This is not a rainsuit. This is trash and the makers of this product should be ashamed of themselves for selling it. I wasted my money on this. I will never buy from this brand again. This rainsuit I will have to throw away in the trash and buy from another company that will not steal my money by selling me this useless garbage.
1,Well worth a listen,"Bob Dylan's son-in-law and one of the most underrated singer-songwriters around. Himmelman writes the most intelligent and uniquely original love songs as illustrated in the song 7 Circles on this CD(another example is ""Love of Midnight"" on the From Strength to Strength CD). There are several radio friendly songs on here, but it is definately not ear candy. He can be tender and he can flat out rock. ""Eyeball"" and ""Million Miles Wide are perfect examples. You will definately not be dissapointed in this selection. The above mentioned ...Strength... CD is Peter Himmelman at his best."
1,Great Book,My 2 year old daughter loves this book. It's a very cute and funny book. I highly recommend it.
1,Good for the price.,"Since this didn't cost a whole lot I didn't expect a whole lot out of it. It works fine, but after owning it a year, it's starting to have a few weird quirks, like when you turn it on after being off for a week or more it makes a weird noise but then works fine."
1,Best damn thing ever,"This is the greatest show. I don't normally buy DVDs, and I never, ever, watch commentary. With Always Sunny, I wish every episode had commentary."
0,Your money is better spent on other books,"The suggestions and explanations in this book are very limited. The best part about the book is the exams, but there are many other books out there that also have practice exams and also explain the solutions better. The most frustrating thing about this book is that on the practice exams, some of the answers don't match the questions. It is hard to get a feel for how well you would do on an actual exma when it is impossible to complete the exam fully due to not having answers that have anything to do with the questions. It isn't by design, just a poor job in editing."
1,PuriLens Complete Care System,"For people with sensitivites to the chemicals in regular contact lense cleaners and disinfectants, this system is great. I have used it for over four years now and have no complaints. Lenses are cleaned and disinfected at the same time in only fifteen minutes. The cleansing unit has a life time guarantee if you use their solution. I have replaced three units now and find that it's cheaper to just buy another care unit when the contacts on the base of the care unit rust out."
1,Good Bio of a little talked about Royal,"Princess Andrew of Greece was brought up in turbulent times. She was a Greek princess of Russian parentage and later became the mother of Queen Elizabeth's husband Prince Philip. She was a shadowy figure in most royal bio's, mostly appearing in her nun's habit. This book tells her story pretty well and the reader soon begins to understand the princess and her times."
0,Terrible Product,"Product was delivered dented on two of the four corners on top. The beer dispenser does not securely screw into the fridge which gives it a very cheap, breakable feel. The regulator does not work and blasts C02 out until the tank I just refilled was empty. I spent hours trying to resolve these issues and eventually just gave up. I wasted 15 on C02 and 75$ on a keg I'll probably only drink 1/10 of before it goes bad. Do not buy this. Cheap product."
1,"Finally, a game that MAKES the PS2!","Amazing graphics, captivating story, enchanting characters, imaginative new systems, difficult puzzles . . . the only problem I've encountered is that there's simply too much stuff. I find myself asking ""where's the game?"" I can't physically play as much as I'd like. The voice-overs and dubs are slightly off, giving it that familiar ""import"" feel. Overall: a 9.90 of 10. This game was extremely well done."
0,lamest book of the year,"Rowley and Rosenzweig might be a lot of things, but swell (or cool, or hip) is not one of them. The Swell... has my vote for the lamest book of the year."
0,Disappointment!,I was looking forward to the complete series also. To say this is a disappointment is an understatement! I would have gladly paid at least $50 to see the whole thing plus commentary and special features! I was looking forward the the reality segments the most. I hope the producers take note of the reviews here and consider putting out a comprehensive collection.
1,"Good book, delivered quickly, and as advertized","If you like Harry Dresden, you'll like this book. Yes, that;s a lame review. There are pl;ot subtelties and character developments that I really should comment upon. Of course, if I did I'd spoil the book. So, I'll just say, if you like Harry, you'll like this book! Go for it!"
1,Amazing depth,"Most people know L'Amour as a strictly Western writer. However, I have owned this book of poetry for about 6 or 7 years, and it continues to amaze me. The variety of poetical styles is impressive. There are humorous anecdotes in poem form, love poems, and haunting poems of wanderlust. Naturally, there are a lot of poems addressing wanderlust, seeing as it was a driving force in L'Amour's life. This collection is highly worthwhile if you are a L'Amour fan, and even if you are not."
0,Highly Overrated,"I was enjoying this movie until Renee Zellweger's spineless character came into the picture. And I'm glad that I wasn't the only person who thought that the kid was annoying! The movie became a slow and sappy chick flick instead of being the strong and fresh sports film that I had anticipated on seeing!But I have to say, Cuba's got the hottest body ever featured on film!...Lord have mercy!"
0,Almost no full fights - Worst best of Ever!!!!!,"This is really ridicolous. There are only two Full fights on Disc 1. Only small fragments of the fights. Some fights only last for seconds, and even when a round starts at minute 3 it keeps on jumping wildly. Its unbelievable how they could do this. So basically disc 1 is garbage. Only disc 2 features twenty full fights, but jones epic battles are completely crippled.A huge step back to previous edtions. Do not buy this compilation. They have mutilated all those glorious fights. I am really angry. I wanted to relieve all those awesome moments, this is a clear rip-off. What were they thinking???????????? Sorry for too fast dooming this Compilation but still what the hell."
0,A very big and wasted mess......,"Just another example of why Hollywood simply does not work anymore. A very tired idea, a very bad screenplay, a young inexperienced director (who showed heart anyway), a studio ""by the numbers"" production, with some nice acting along the way (Billy Bob as usual), leads to the very ""big yawn"" and a 100 million dollar mistake! Don't waste your time on this one!"
1,Good police story,"Very good book. been wanting to read it for some time, but could never find a copy. Thank you Amazon.com!"
1,Nothing!,"The title for the album is far from true. This album has the deepest sustained chords ever! The deep vibe and slow punch of the album leaves you incapable of turning this off, I cannot stress how deep the guitars are on this disc! Absolutely insane! Rational Gaze and Spasm has got the deepest riffs in the Meshuggah catalog. The groove of this album is mind blowing."
0,Embarassing,"Please. Do not support music like this , it only encourages mediocrity. Music is an art , and this is not art. Just listen to the music of Jimi Hendrix - exploratory , mystical , imaginative - and then this junk. The music on this cd is a packaged , plastic corporate product. I remember hearing them promoting it on Howard Stern before it was released. I was utterly embarassed to hear the new hit single Let Me Go. Trust me , if you pick it up in the store and are considering buying it , take that song seriously."
1,Good clock,"Looks and sounds great...only complaint is that you cannot adjust the volume. We have our clock in a well lit area (day and night) so the sensor is getting a lot of light, but it's still not as loud as we want it to be."
1,The best Marvel movie yet!,I really enjoyed Marvel comics as a child and these movies bring that enjoyment into the 21st century. I hope I get this as a present for Chrismas. The instant view rental on Amazon worked flawlessly.
1,Excellent!,"Bryan Davis is one of my favorite Christian authors. This is a book that you - whether you're a teen or adult - can read many times over without growing bored of it. Although it is set in this world, Raising Dragons is a magnificent fantasy piece that begins fast and doesn't slow down.Along the way you'll learn to identify with the characters, appreciate the mysteries and look forward to that next page turning. This book is a thriller with plenty of twists and satisfyingly unexpected turns.Thank you, Mr. Davis! :) I can't wait for more books."
1,Very Cute,I bought this for my grandma for Christmas. She loved it. When it comes in the mail the sign & smoke pipe are detached. The sign you simply stick in it's place hole. It stays well. The smoke pipe comes with a screw to attach it yourself (helps prevent damage in shipping). Everything looked great except by the time it came to me in the mail 2 of the park benches had come unglued. Used a little wood glue to put it back together & it was good as new. :) Very pleased with the product overall.
1,Not flavored,"Thought they were flavored, but they are not. Smell nice, girlfriend liked them. Banana smell is not the most pleasant, though apple and strawberry smell like jolly ranchers :)"
1,HB Meal Maker grill,"I am almost 70 and wanted a ""quick and clean"" hamburger maker. This one is PERFECT! Easy to clean ...fabulous burgers that have the fat drained off and quick for use (about 10 minutes including warm-up for the first two and 5 min a pair thereafter.) ..Highly recommend this ...and the price was nice compared to the less attractive Foreman series."
1,Thoughtful lyrics and rockin' tunes. I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I love The Waiting. Their first album reveals depth and a wide range of styles that are normally lacking on debut albums. You gotta get this one.
0,Warning from california prop 65,Why in this day and age do we sell items containing lead for cooking food? Wish I saw Char broils manual before I purchased this grill. Made in china. Poor quality stamped metals. Grill stored in protected site when not in use and already show signs of rust in less than 6 months when only used twice. Side burner flame is too far away from pan bottom to be effective--worst design I have seen yet on any grill I have owned. Last char broil product I will purchase!
1,Great item,We love this item. We bought this to go with an incline for our girls to practice gymnastics on. Seems to be very durable. Stiching seems very strong. We are going to be purchasing a second one so there is no fight over whos turn it is. I like the fact this also folds up so it can be put in a closet or tucked behind the couch. It was a good value for the money.
0,I want a good copy!,"""Way Out West"" is my favorite Stan & Ollie film. It is consistantly clever; the horse on the balcony, the head under the pail, the bodies in the piano, and of course, the delightful dance sequence. Alas, I sold my really fine VHS version, expecting someone to eventually give justice to this fun romp. When do you think someone, even Criterion, will wake up and realize that quality entertainment cannot be compromised, and a loving public will not settle for mediocrity?"
0,Not as good as I hoped,"I really like some of the Bollywood stuff I've heard on my college radio station. I suppose what I've heard represents the best of various CDs. I bought this CD expecting a similar compilation but was disappointed. To my ears, the music on the first CD sounds like Indian versions of American movie music of the 1960's (not my cup of tea). The second CD is more contemporary, but I didn't discover any ""gems"" among the tracks. That's my opinion."
0,Don't bother!,Actors played as best they could but the plot was all over the board - IMO it was a wasted evening!
1,Informative,I like it because it has a lot of links on the end off the book. It is informative but in some parts to long winded. I like that she can tell from her experience as a thyroid cancer survivor.And at the end she has some alternative healing methods.All in one a good book.
0,I have not seen...,...this movie nor do I plan to after reading about on Wikipedia. Hithcock's Psycho was perfect and did not need to be remade!
0,"Excuuuuuuse me, Nintendo!","I can't imagine what Nintendo was smoking when they licensed their product to these people. Link's whiny,tough guy attitude alone makes this almost entirely unwatchable. Add to him brown hair, a semi-retarded fairy and a know it all princess and you have the exact opposite of everything we've come to love about this iconic video game series.I dare you to try and get through just one episode."
0,there are other cameras out there better than this,"First of all I understand that a digital camera under 30 dollars is not going to give you high quality pics. I assure you this camera indeed does not take very good pics, the pics are somewhat blurry, not crisp at all. I bought a cheapo camera attachment for my pda a while back that took pictures of simalar quality.Although this camera might be usefull for taking pics of items youre putting on Ebay or maybe of houses if youre a real estate agent and don't need big quality pics, you can do better. There are cameras out there the size of a credit card that takes pics that are no worse than the ones this one takes. Shop around for a smaller camera if picture quality is not of tremendous importance."
1,OC Series,Dvd set was shipped quickly and was is great condition. All dvds seem to be working..not quite finished watching yet! Would definitely order here again!
0,Borderline hack-work,"There are three different aspects in this book. Part of it is an argument that a technological human society previously existed and was wiped out something like 15,000 years ago. In this regard, the book borders on the absurd, not much better than the works by the ""aliens-built-the-pyramids"" crowd.The second aspect is the end-of-the-world fictional narrative. Just watch the movie ""The Day After Tomorrow."" I think it was inspired by this book.Lastly, there is a quasi-scientific attempt to explain how a rapid and drastic change in the global climate could occur. This would produce a global storm of biblical proportions that could usher in a new Ice Age. This would happen in a matter of months and not years (or decades).Mildly interesting but, keep in mind: neither of these authors has any real credentials. I don't have much confidence in the science behind the claims but it's not a complete waste of time, if you like end-of-the-world books."
1,"Meat Goats, history,management and diseases","I found this book packed full of useful information, in an easy to read and interesting format. The history section alone is worth the price of the book. I use it as a reference book, but also is great for recreational reading."
0,Software is NOT compatible with OS X 10.5,"Here are the documented system requirements as shown to a customer:# Macintosh:# Power Mac# 68020 or faster processor# 8 MB RAM# 80 MB hard disk space# 2x or faster CD-ROM drive# 256-color or better video display# MouseMy computer meets these requirements. However after receiving the CD a key system requirement was identified:OS 7.5 - 9Hmmm wait a minute. OS X (10.5.1) Leopard no longer supports OS 9!When you insert this CD you will get:You can't open the application ""Dr. Seuss's ABC"" because the Classic environment is no longer supportedThe little apple compatibility icon needs to be updated to reflect reality."
1,Wonderful absurdist journey,"This highly inventive novel captures readers within the first few pages with its vivid and personal descriptions of the tormented, pretentious, and hilarious mind of the writer (read ""artiste"") protagonist. Those who have felt caught between the worlds of adolesence and adulthood and those who have wondered why we bother to call art ""Art"" will find a comrade in arms in this author. His ability to peel away at human pretense and expose the inherent absurdity of life is both ruthless and gentle. The scenarios he builds are profoundly implausible but uncannily truthful reflections of the essential human condition. A must read for lovers of surrealist masterpieces -- like ""The Master and Margarita"" or ""Love in the Time of Cholera""."
1,Um... more discrete packaging!?!,"If Amazon is going to start selling sex toys, for the love of god could they consider using better packaging? A padded mailing envelope is not the appropriate wrapping for a 7"" vibrator. So if you are the least bit squeamish about your mailman, or your doorman, or your roommate knowing that you ordered a vibrator, then you best steer clear of ordering this.But other than that, the product is fabulous for the price."
0,Worthless for autodidactics,The book provides numerous excercises but solutions are onlyavailable to course instructors. I.e. the book is worthless for autodidactics.
0,"Pressure problem, get's clogged up after a year","I would not recommend anyone to buy this. It was handy that you have 4 gallons available. Pressure was a problem. Following year did not spray well even after cleaning, although there was no way to clean the passageways."
0,Not as good as European Anthology,"Due to legal matters, this double is both shorter and less authoritative than the European Anthology compilation (it includes no Kinks-era recordings from 1966-70). Being as how little of Dave's output outside of this classic time-frame is really up to much (""Imagination's Real"" and ""Living On A Thin Line"" apart - and these both feature on the Anthology) I can't really recommend this for anyone apart from the kompletists."
0,Not Compatible with Mac or iPods,"I love this movie, think it's the most unappreciated film of last year and one of my favorites. The Blu-ray is excellent, this is a film that's made for High-Def. This is a reference disk you show HD newbs, who'll take one look and say ""I get it now. The picture and audio are stunning."" The colors really pop on my Sony Bravia, the audio is amazing, good extra features. This 3 disk version gets 1 star because the Digital Copy isn't compatible with Macs or iPods. It's the first Blu-ray that I've encountered that does this and I specifically purchased this 3 Disc version for the Digital Copy. I travel a lot and like having that ability to watch on the plane and in my hotel."
1,Ringo-never better!,"What a pleasure it was to open my Amazon mailer box, plug this terrific Christmas CD into my computer, and listen while I surfed. I am in the Christmas Spirit and it is mid-January! I expected ""OK"" Ringo...and got great music. Great covers; Great instrumental work; GREAT Ringo! A must have if you are a Beatle fan who is familiar with ""Christmas Time Is Here Again"" from the fan club sets. Get it if you just love Christmas! Just get it, folks, you will not be disappiointed."
1,Great resource,"If you are planning your own wedding this is a great resource. There are so many good ideas contained in this one book. This book gave rise to more ideas that I would not have thought of otherwise. It isn't perfect - there are flaws here and there, but these are mainly personal. I love the sections where you can pick and choose from contemporary or traditional. This book does contain Christian-based ceremonies as well as spiritually-based ones."
1,anyone who enjoys the classic movies,"love the old movies, the acting is always good. It nice to watch good movies for a change. love it"
1,Nice sturdy clamps,"These are nice sturdy clamps. I do a lot of random small projects (from brake repair to wood and metal working), and these are a lifesaver. They exceeded my expectations for a clamp (which were admittedly low)."
0,nukote ink roller,"CAME TO ME DRY, NO INK, BUT MERCHANT, GAVE ME A FULL REFUND, NINUS THE RETURN SHIPPING, WHICH I FEEL SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO ME, I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS SELLER, BECAUSE OF THIS FACT, I FEEL THAT HE SHOULD HAVE REFUNNED MY SHIPPING MONEY"

0,Less than two years old and dead as a door nail,"I was happily making coffee every day. I was fine with the unit until this morning when I woke up and all signs of life on the coffee maker were gone. Wouldn't brew coffee and there wasn't any indicator in the timer slot so that wasn't working. Basically, something very key seems to have worn out. I guess I'm lucky. After reading many of the other negative reviews here, that it didn't catch on fire. But, I expect YEARS of service out of a coffee maker. Is that too much to ask? This purchase was me, upgrading from my old Mr. Coffee. Guess that was a mistake. I'm very disappointed and now have to go out and get a cup of coffee."
0,This isn't the model I received,"I ordered this model, the HHT-011, because it had a permanent filter. I received the HHT-016-MP, which isn't a HEPA and has two replaceable filters, and I realized the mistake wasn't mine after the time to return it had lapsed. I had a non-HEPA air purifier that I wanted to replace because I the filters were discontinued, and I didn't want to fall into that trap again, but here I am.Note to all: when you get this, don't rip it open and plug it in. It might not be what you ordered."
0,Charlie Bone and the Time Twister,"The book was ok. There was a little suspense and excitement. But, things keep coming that just come from nowhere. Such as the girl becoming a bird and the secret tunnel just happening to be there when they need it. No one had mentioned it before. It seems to be a poor knockoff for Harry Potter. I really don't know how they got published. I've read two now and will probably not read any more."
0,Disappointed,"This book was difficult to read. It was filled with mechanical errors. words were spelled wrong, the grammar was off, and several parts of the book were switched."
1,Question,I have a question about this book:Is it lendable? I want to know if one of my friends can lend it to me.
1,Awesome glimpse into the underworld of GenX music!,"Couldn't put it down! Everyone I know who has read this absolutely loves it! It is a many-faceted reading experience, full of side-splitting humor, pathos and drama. The characters are incredibly well drawn and believable. Even though this is ""based on"" the DJ's experiences, I am sure it is about as real as it can get without giving away identities. It is even educational and informative, regarding the radio and DJ industry. Best of all, it has a spiritual dimension, which is hard to define in a brief review. You will just have to read it to understand how that can fit with the topic. Awesome!"
1,Love it.,I usually pay $25 here in Alaska for waxing my eyebrows and lip. This is a great product that is easy to use and does a great job. Highly recommend it.
0,Gardens of the moon,"My first book by this author.Maybe it's because I have a poor memory for names, and this book has way too many characters, but I didn't like it overall.It left me confused most of time as to what was going on."
0,the new voice-overs are depressing.,"If you watched and loved this movie as a kid, do not(!) buy this disney version. I just bought it & I can't even watch it all the way through. It is definately worth it to try to track down the fox family version."
1,Great fights!,"This movie is incomparable. I saw it three times in theaters and each time converted a new, previously sceptical friend. Jet is as endearing as ever, but more importantly, the fight scenes cannot be matched. They had to write Jet's character's superhuman background into the story simply to justify how fast he moves. You won't be disappointed."
1,A success,"I've read this book twice, and each time I had the same feeling about it. Very satisfied.one could feel the heat and dust coming from the story as if he were living with the characters.Ruth Jhabvala is very talented in describing every little detail and makes you live inside the scene, especially when she comes to describe the state of India and the crowed, disgust, infections, and poverty.I really felt disgusted reading some lines that I had to stop for a moment thinking of what I've just read.What I liked the most is having two parallel stories separated by two generations.The first woman is the narrator who travels to India to discover more about the scandal of Olivia, and unconsciously she follows the same pathclaiming that India changes whoever lives there and finally the two characters experience the same end.The language of the book is simple and fascinating I think everyone would enjoy it ."
1,Beautiful story about mother daughter love/hate relationship,I loved this story. It was an easy read and kept your attention at all times. I love how this author incorporates magic into her stories. It takes you away from normal day to day life and adds just enough spice to make it almost believable. Definately a good book
0,Piece of crap,"I bought this item to use under a poodle skirt. Well, it didnt do anything. I was expecting a poofier underskirt, but what I got was basically a skirt made out of tulle. It's not even slightly poofy. And when I put it under the skirt, it wasn't even even so it made my hips look all uneven and bumpy. I can't send it back, so I'm stuck with it. The stretchy part is made of some kind of crappy pseudo silk. Super cheap. Super unsexy. Pass on this item and go with something else."
0,Fine acting,"The acting was fine. I was expecting something a little lighter, so maybe it's my expectations that make me think they were going for something they didn't quite get. They seemed to be presenting information (spoilers) - the mental health issues mixed with the alcoholism and everybody in town knowing about it except the main character and Patrick Wilson's sister's encouraging behavior (not a well-written character - too obvious with her sycophantic behavior) that finally points the main character into realizing how lucky she is not to live there (too easy). But there is no resolution to any of it and it makes very little sense (I suppose they were trying for a little slice in the life of a mentally unstable person). They also throw Patton Oswalt's character in like a bone for a dog, so to speak, to show how really selfish and self-involved she is and yet totally confused."
0,Purchase The Complete Set Instead,While the series is superb the tactic of selling this series in three installments is not economical for consumers. I recommend purchasing the complete set which is a much better for consumers and the environment.
1,Great product,I purchased two of these DJ strips to use for my fish aquarium. Very happy with the purchase and have had no problems so far. Very easy to install and use. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a power supply that you can control each piece of your equipment without having to unplug it each time you need to turn it off
0,Recharge Life Stinks,"Maybe I ust got a ad batch, but I only got a couple of good recharges out of them. Now it does not appear that they will take a charge. Now they are basically useles scrap. I think considering the amount I paid for them I should et a little more life out of them."
0,Somewhere?,Ok I bought this cd for Somewhere over the Rainbow. It is the only tune I like on the album so I didnt want to give it 1 star. But if i rated by # of songs I actually listen to it would have gotten only a 1.But somewhere over the rainbow is one of the best tunes I think I have ever heard. I love it.
1,I enjoyed this book very much,I really enjoyed Tears of the Moon and as I was nearing the end I didn't want to finish it because I knew that I wouldn't find another book I enjoyed so much in a long time. I have been searching for Di Morrisey's other books and have had no luck either here or in the library. can you help me locate her others so I can read them too? Thank you
0,DON'T BUY FROM THIS SUPPLIER,I paid for expedited shipment on the product (1-3) day delivery. Over a week later I was still waiting. The company was totally unresponsive to my attempts at contacting them.STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0,Not What I Ordered,"I ordered White Diamonds EAU de Parfum and received EAU de Toilette. This product came from Target. Amazon was very good at giving me a complete refund and did not have me send the Toilette back.I then ordered the same thing directly from Target. The very same thing happened. Target has been more difficult to work with. Basically, I do all the work inorder to get a refund when the mistake is on their part. Amazon is great to work with."
1,Great Clock radio,"Great sound and rectption. clock LED is a little bright and a red led would be better, otherwise it is a 5 star radio"
0,Hair Lady,"These clippers stink! I lost the #3 extension on my Wahl clippers, so I bought these thinking Oster is an AWESOME brand ... their profession line is great, but this product is a piece of junk. It shreds the hair instead of cutting it and it pulls like crazy on any kind of hair (fine, medium, course)."
1,Insanity and sex and violence,"basically this entire movie can be summed up into two words: acid trip. the film certainly seems this way as it showcases some crazy animation (a man getting chased on a lawnmower by a blade of grass, who later turns into an orange caterpillar). i reccomend you smoke or drop something before seeing this movie as it makes it funnier and more interesting, but insane either way."
1,One of the bands greatest albums,Enough variety and good metal that makes me rank this as one of the bands best albums.
1,"Informative, exciting.","Started slowly and developed slowly but then it had me. Not only a captivating read for the excitement of the story, but also very informative historically."
0,disappointed,"This does not look very ""high def"" and certainly not filmed at 1080p. Also, with all that room on a B-ray disc, you think they could make the segments longer than a few minutes; what happened, did the fishy's union demand overtime or something? It's not like there is huge overhead filming a tank of fish with a stationary camera. Waste of money."
0,Disappointing portrayal of Bernadette,"I do not agree with the unquestioned assertions that this film is more historically accurate. A sometimes flippant, borderline sarcastic, and not very humble Bernadette portrayed in this film is not at all an accurate representation of her story. Accuracy is not determined by chronology but by accurate representation of the Catholic imagination, which was brilliantly captured by Jewish author Franz Werfel, upon which the vastly superior film ""Song of Bernadette"" was based.God chooses the lowly to give witness does not mean he chooses someone we would like to think of as being just like us, in all our splendid stupidity and shallowness. No. The saintly are and were different than us and deserve to be shown more respect that this film manages to do. Actually the sequel to this film, The Passion of Bernadette, is far superior, because Bernadette is portrayed with a greater sensitivity and greater level of holiness."
0,Triple D,"Dark, dreary, depressing. I saw no purpose in the story and almost didn't make it to the end. Don't let the amount of award nominations fool you."
1,Oldie but good,This is a good series but for the third installment.......my opinion is the same as others. I'm glad I purchased however. The seller was prompt and product arrived earlier than expected. Customer service was excellent. Thanks
1,Ginaluca Grignani,"I think this has been the best CD i have ever heard, all these songs a great! I can hear this CD over and over and i wont get tierd of it. --no importa lo que digan otros este CD es muy fantastico."
0,Not impressed,"I was not impressed with this book at all. As a hospital corpsman who has served in Iraq I couldn't help but laugh at the complaints of CDR Ruff. We all endured the same situations in Iraq and unfortunately some of us had to be deployed for a lot longer then 122 days. I picked up the book excited to read about someone elses perspective on the war, I was very disappointed to read only about how miserable one person was on her very brief deployment. Iraq is what you make of it, and complaining only makes it worse. Don't get me wrong I have great respect for the patient care but thats where my apprectiation for this book ends."
0,"Poor performance, and damaged my phone screen","The cover fits my phone well, but its performance has been very sub-standard, as I've owned other Body Glove covers in the past (for different phone models).The first week I used the cover, it made a permanent indention/smudge on my phone screen - which means I have little or no chance of selling the phone at the end of my contract.Also, the front clear plastic window constantly sticks to the display window of the RAZR. Very, very annoying.Overall, not a high-quality product. Very disappointed in Body Glove."
1,GREAT Canister,Great Canister! Perfect for keeping our Coffee it a sealed container. Latch works great and is easy to access and operate. I don't know if the seal is airtight but I have had no problem with the seal. If you are in the market for an stainless steel canister Do Not hesitate to buy this one.
0,warning,This product is not the same as the one you see in the picture. If you get this item you will not be able to get to your pc without pushing your phone out of the case. Forget about getting help from SF Planet it make it hard to return items. Do not buy this unless you only want to use your telephone and not your computer.
1,valuable contribution to literature,This is one of the finest works ever written. I could not put it down.The writer should be granted an award for this workA wider distribution is necessary.A movie needs to be made about his extraordinary workUnbelivable writing style and sentance structure
0,One Of R.L's worst ever,"This book was phony and unreal. All of his books are a little far-fetched but this was rediculious. I mean who would belive that vampires run aroud trying to make them like, Etrnal."
1,"Pretty good, overall","I'm not a big fan of the archaic Resident Evil controls and gameplay, but Onimusha manages to utilize the control scheme for a faster paced action game with some adventure and puzzle elements. It's very satisfying, and if you can find it for the right price, it is certainly worth it. Some may complain about the length, so I don't recommend spending more than 10 dollars on the game."
1,Had me from Whooo....,"Each season is well written. I watch each season from first episode to last; it doesn't matter if I've seen the episode before. Well written, sometimes far fetched, but definitely entertaining enough to get my mind going in the process."
1,My favorite musical besides Les Miserables!!!,This CD makes me feel so good when I listen to it. I think everyone should own a copy!!!
0,"Pretty pictures, useless book","A written-by-committee book full of beautiful photographs, mostly of built-in bookshelves and cabinets.You'll get no help PLANNING a wall system. There are lots of photo examples in rooms with soaring twenty-foot ceilings. Lots of examples designed by architects and built in when the mansion was constructed. None of this will help plan a wall system in an average home.You'll get little or no help with BUILDING or DESIGNING a wall systems in an average home. The focus is on the pretty photos, the text is simply fill-in. No plans. No non-obvious design hints."
1,"Great, Interesting read.",I read this book a while back and thought it was very interesting. It's a good book to read if your tired of just reading love stories all the time.
0,iListen didn't iHear what iHad to say!,"After purchasing the software version 7, I downloaded the upgrade to version 8. No documentation came in the box, one must also download a PDF from their website. Documentation for the latest version was NOT available from their website. After exhaustive hours of training the software with no results, I emailed the company asking for more specific instructions for recognizing WAV files. Over a month later, I still haven't received a response. I found this product to be completely useless."
1,The Game of Death,"These CD's are a must for Bruce Lee fans, and martial artists who enjoy his movies. These songs put you in the state of mind that you get when you view one of his excellent movies. My only criticism is that there are a few slow songs that don't really inspire me to keep listening."
0,Not worth it,"When our phone rang, it would set off the bark monitor every time. This defeated the training purpose of the device. Also? It chewed through batteries super fast b/c it was always going off from the phone ringing, the train going by, etc. Our dog became a nervous wreck, never knowing when that awful high-pitched sound was going to go off. Not worth it!"
0,Stay away,"I thought this was a top of the line charger when I got it. I've had it replaced twice by the manufacturer. The first one started smoking. The second had one charging port that wouldn't work at all. I kept the third one and use it to soft charge AA batteries only when I'm around. There's no way I'd leave this thing unattended for the hours that reconditioning cycles require. I just tried a soft reconditioning of some AA batteries, and the unit keeps getting frozen in the discharge phase. I've let it sit overnight with no change. Even when I remove the batteries, the display stays frozen until I unplug the unit.I have always loaded the batteries with the correct polarity, in the correct order (highest capacity > lowest capacity), and always on a hard countertop with plenty of air circulation.I just got a MH-C9000 from the same manufacturer, and so far it's working great. I may get another and dump the MH-C808M. This is not worth the fire risk."
1,Great!,"This book offers an interesting account of a psychedelic experience as well as social commentary. You will find blocks of narrative along with little sprinkles here and there of solid criticism of drab, sanctioned lifestyles."
1,Magical Memories,"My aunt found this book in a garage sale in the 70's. She's loved the illustrations and the story ever since. It's been handed down the generations - first her sons, then to me, and now it's being passed on to the newest members of the family. The illustrations are simple, fun and darling - ""Where the Wild Things Are"" meets ""Where's Waldo?"" - there's just so much to see in the small details. The story itself makes us feel connected to our Filipino roots, and for the family members born abroad, it introduces them to their culture.I would love to get more copies of this book to pass onto friends' children but it's no longer available. I wish the publishers would reconsider printing it again."
1,Best movie ever,"I must say this movie is by far my all time favorite movie. I have literally watched it 40 or more times and it still hasn't gotten old. I first bought this movie in UMD format for my PSP (original). But finally I decided to buy the dvd format because I have pretty much always wanted to see it on a bigger screen. I would buy the blue-ray version (Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children Complete, I think), however I'm in no mood to pay a bit extra even though my PS3 (original) would play it very nicely. Plus its not really worth the extra money just to get better quality when the movie is great in any format. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves fantasy and role play games. Even if you have not played a single Final Fantasy game in your life, the movie is amazing."
0,I know theyre local but......,"IM sorry, but shotstar makes bad music. They are merely an imitation of the great ""emo"" bands listed above in the editorial review. Buy Pinkerton by Weezer, at least they can write decent songs."
0,Can do better,"I recently purchased the Tourmaline Brush Pack and was disappointed. The larger brush pull my hair (I have shoulder length hair). I found no difference in the brushes than the Ceramic Ionic Brush I bought at Target for less than $10, in fact I like my target brush better."
0,"""Best Of"" & ""Joy Division"" - Reissue, Repackage","This compilation is expendable. It's aimed at those too cheap to shell out for Unknown Pleasures, Closer, Still and Substance. There is nothing on this recording you would gain from owning the other four, and so much you would be missing. You're not buying snacks for a party or the cheapest beer for your visiting relatives here. This is your future we're talking about and you're negating the chance to colour any experience or event with the cynicism, insight and optimism of these albums. Go study your Fac numbers and buy 10, 25, 40 and 250 now. Add FACD 219 if you're serious."
0,The seller is too bad,"They sent me the wrong item, and rather dismissive about my complaint. I sent a complaint letter to Amazon.com about weeks ago, haven't heard anything from it yet.Very bad purchase experience."
0,Oh! Great... is not the same 3V and 4.5V,"I got a Psyc CD Walkman with AM/FM Tuner, everything is ok with it.The only thing is that I wanted to use my old AC/DC adaptors (at home/car) and, it turned that the psync cd player has a 3V input, instead of a 4.5V as it's shown at sonystyle.com page. It took me time to be sure about getting that product and I trusted in sony's information, and now I have to live with that, (I'm just kidding).[...]Besides that inconvenient, the Cd Player comes with a lot of options, the loading stuff showed in the screen is great, it also shows you the percent loaded of the disc, programmable shutdown, and the radio works great, also the way how directories are showed now, it only uses a AA battery.To be perfect it needs a backlight to use it in the darkness and, of course I need a 3V adaptor now. And sony also needs to check some articles descriptions.Now I feel better..."
1,Aural candy,"Sometimes you just need a little sugar, and Clueless provides it - though some of the songs are quite annoying (Counting Crows come to mind), the rest of the CD is good enough that you'll listen whenever you need a quick pick-me-up. The best, I think, is Coolio's ""Rollin' With My Homies"" - you won't be able to stop moving along."
0,Disappointed,"Just would like to know, WHERE IS THE BOOK. all I got was like a study guide. Very disappointed. I know it was free, but I thought I got a book to read. Any idea how to fix this?"
0,"AWFULL CD, Boring.",The Word evolution does not exixt in the Luis Miguel dictionary this album is boring and sound the same like all his music.He needs to learn about Ricky Martin that always surprise us with a good album.
1,Incredible,I can't say enough about this author. Every book of his is incredible. great book like all his others.
1,Great digital SLR camera for beginners,"This a great camera for amateur photo enthusiasts who want to try out different exposure settings, and see the results immediately. One of the best features I found in this camera is the concept of auto-ISO. This enables the camera to set the ISO setting automatically, depending on the shutter speed and the amount of ambient light available."
1,good album....ok dmb album,"The album certainly has some great songs on it. Song like Everybody Wake Up and Hunger for the Great Light are remeniscent of earlier fan favorites like Rhyme/Reason. What sets this back from some of DMB's classic albums is this: Leroi and Boyd are not featured nearly enough. What sets DMB apart is the way all the musicians come together and the powering solos of the Violin and the Sax. This CD is a bit too raw for most hardcore DMB fans. I do think that when they play these songs live the band might have something up theyre sleve, as they always do, and throw the sax and violin into the songs a little more. So thats it. It's good music, but its not what you have come to know and love from DMB. Experimenting with a well known Pop/HipHop produce...probably not DMB's greatest move."
0,Unless you have a six-string bass...,"don't buy this tape. Although a few exercises you can adjust to a four-string bass, most require you to own a six-string bass. That or doing a lot of tuning up and down."
0,Who was really deceived?,"Absolutely the worst book I've read this year. Tedious, rife with cliches (like that!), stilted characters about whom you care little and a break-neck pace in so many locations around the whole frigging world without, might I mention, any solid clue as to the time-line (until of course, we enter the final ""deception,"" and the fuse is burning while Dudley Doright is still thinking it through and Nell will be singed at the very least).Even, dare I say, Tom Clancy can be THIS appealing. Well, not quite.Very disappointed."
1,Interactive Romance?,"Like you can see, all the reviews under this are very positive for this book. That's the reason I bought this. I must say that this was great book. Awesome! But this missed something. Something very important. Like action and excitement? Some momets this is boring etc. Now I think that I shouldn't have bought this book, because there is better books in Sweet Valley High. I'll rate this with 4 stars."
1,Perfectly scented,"This body wash has the exact scent as CK cologne, as far as I can tell. A little goes a long way, compared to regular body washes. It is a nice consistency and leaves you feeling luxurious all over."
1,this is the one you want,"Best nonstick, and you can flip the griddles over to cook pancakes or pressed hot sandwiches, like a panini. Heats up fast and works like a champ. It's a little tricky to clean around the handles but well worth it anyway. You can put butter in a metal bowl on top to melt. This seems to be the same as the design GE made for decades and it costs about the same as buying a vintage one on an auction site, maybe less."
0,Rent but don't buy,"Ok, I bought this game, and I was impressed. The graphics are incredible, the story is original (if juvenile), and it was all around amusing...for a good ten minutes. Pikmin then begins to devolve into something little more than brainless drivel. The concept seems fairly difficult before you play the game, forcing you to control not only the half-inch Capitain Olivar, but an army of quarter-inch centurions. After playing the game, you realize how infantile the gameplay actually is. Great gift for small children, great to rent if you're bored, but don't make the same mistake I did...don't waste fifty dollars on this game."
1,Great item if it wasn't missing parts,I had to order two of these and the second one was missing parts too! Its a great item but why are so many parts missing. The manufacturer was quick to send out the missing parts but still its dissapointing when you can't put something together.
1,Useful and Easy to Use!,"I speak no more than 8-10 words of Italian. I used this book on a recent trip to Italy, and was able to understand almost every menu item I saw, and to order with confidence. It's a marvelous book! The alphabetical organization makes it really easy to use when you're sitting in a restaurant faced with three pages of Italian on a menu.I've ordered the similar volume for Spain for an upcoming trip there, and will always look for this series for future trips, even to countries where I can speak the language."
0,Worst Vacuum ever!,"We bought this vacuum on the strength of its reviews here and in Comsumer Reports. Everyone seemed to love it. However, we have had this vacuum less than 1 year and have already had to replace the belt 6 times!! We also had problems with the motor overheating. When it works, yes it does OK. Our problem with it is that it almost never is in working order! Junk! Don't go near it!"
0,Movie bad dvd good,I am a big fan of Adam Sandler but this movie ... I hope their next movie is beter. Anyways the dvd stuff is better then most dvds. If you like the movie get it if you never saw it and collect dvds don't get it.
1,One of the top ten books you should own.,Buy it and read it more than once -- maybe once a year. The best of the best -- classic Packer.
1,PREFERABLE ONE BUT NOT GIVEN ALL ANSWERS TO VERIFY,This is a book featuring a good explanation both mathematical as well as physical.One of the better books in the field of circuit analysis.But there are no answers for even numbered problems which is the main problem with it.The exercise problems are challenging though it is the essential in creating interest.But I've found that the terminology used is ANTI-ENGINEERING LANGUAGE.I've got 80%satisfaction. Meet you later..Byaeee
1,Really good on the details!,"I have found this to be of immediate value in figuring out who made what. No, it doesn't have all the answers, but covers most things pretty well, and certainly better than any other reference I have. A must for any serious collector or dealer of American silver."
0,Terrible!,"I watched this movie once, and it made me feel stupid just for buying it. It's horribly innacurate, and terribly made. The characters have about as much depth as poetry by Homer Simpson. Rent it, then do the video store a favor, and burn the tape."
1,Quiet Blade,"As has already been pointed out here, this blade has minimal runout and performs extremely well. As a professional cabinet maker that has used just about every blade out there, I can say that this is hands down my favorite. And if you have a task that this blade isn't really suited for, Tenryu probably makes one that does the job better than any other available.One thing I have not seen mentioned yet in these reviews is how these blades sound. They seem much quieter in use to me, and while this may be purely subjective, the tone they do produce has a very satisfying quality to it.Simply put, if your are obsessed with having the best, ditch the freuds and forrests and get some tenryus. You will not regret it."
0,Worked great at first,"Worked great for about 3 wks then nothing, replaced the battery and worked great for 2 days and now back to no recorded steps."
1,CONTENTS OF THIS LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE VIDEO,This video contains 2 of the most beloved episodes of the Little House On The Prairie TV Series:Christmas At Plum Creek (1974)A Christmas They Never Forgot (1981)I absolute love both of these titles and it is so great to have them both on one video to watch anytime I want.
1,Queer is tasty,"The good thing about this book is that is it so simple to read. The words flow perfectly and you dont get tripped up on huge words that nobody knows. The actual story is about a homosexual smack addict and you really feel for the character. You are hoping the best turns out for him and his lover. The character is very likeable. I only gave it 4 stars because the book in the end goes nowhere. Not a great ending, but definitely an enjoyable book."
1,A Fabulous Introduction!,"Dr. Christianson's ""Writing Lives is the Devil"" is a quality choice for readers who want to learn the inside dealings of how a biography is written. The style Christianson uses to write the articles flows and shapes into a simple story the reader can easily follow. His articles on the back-door operations of a biographer at work clearly illustrate how complex the profession of historian can be. With several references to his previous works, the reader becomes enthralled in the lives of many of his subjects and may very well want to dive into the other biographies. ""Writing Lives is the Devil"" is a great choice for would-be biographers to learn the tricks of the trade, and for a easy-reading for current biographers as well."
0,s-l-o-w; couldn't finish it,"Thrillers are supposed to be thrilling and move briskly along. This book does neither. Cardboard characters, contrived plot, way too much meaningless descriptive background...avoid."
0,Their are MUCH better products out there!,"I purchased the ""Shark"" about a month ago from Amazon. I had read good things but to my dismay they were un-true. The cleaner does spray steam, but the temperature is lukewarm at most. All it was doing was dampening the surfaces I was cleaning!! I could do that myself and save the $100 dollars I spent on this sorry excuse for a squirt gun. I then came back to Amazon to review and express my terrible experiences with the Shark. Before I did though, I read the other reviews. (...)"
1,Scary!!,I 1st saw this movie in 1979-1980 and It's still as scary now as it was then. Great plot that follows the book very well!
1,A Very Good Book,"The first I had ever heard of the USS Indianapolis was in the movie Jaws. Unfortunately my history classes in school did not cover this subject. Apparently they felt it was not a big enough part of World War II. But this was a tragedy full of mistakes by many. The ship was not noticed missing for days, it was sunk after the end of the war. The sailors faced certain death from dehydration or being eaten alive (sharks) and the Captain was court-martialled for following procedures.This is an exceptional book that will keep your interest and enlighten you on a subject that many do not know about. I can not compare to other books on the subject as this is the first I have read. But it was well worth my time to read it."
1,So bad its good,"Had this tape when i was a kid, used to watch it until the video player ate it. Just a bunch of clips of classic strange horror/sci-fi movies, some of which are pretty strange."
0,total crap,not even worth 1$after trying all the settings possiblei get a lot of static and the best part is that the led display is all black after a couple of days of use
0,Disappointing Self-Absorption,"Numerous contemporary British psychotherapists, of which Orbach is one, have written compassionately and insightfully - for the lay person as well for pracitioners - on countertransference. Orbach has a clinical practice. Of course she is a good person who wants the best for her patients. But in a leap of faith, she has made up the stories, invented the patients. This is not about her clinical practice. It is about her. These fictional patients exist as vehicles by which we learn about Susie Orbach. Very disappointing. In addition, The book has been tarted up for publication and hoped-for sales by the use of the word ""sex"" in the title. We learn very little about her process, or even her respect for, interest in, or conflicts with with her (made-up) ""patients."" A hodge-podge. I came away feeling that in Orbach's view, the most compelling subject is - herself."
1,Cute Alligator,"I bought this for my little boy for his first birthday. He is attempting to walk and I hope this will be the motivation to get him to walk more. He loves watching me play with it and it's very durable. This is one of those toys where he won't grow out of quickly, like most toys I've seen. He can play with this inside and outside and have a constant companion.It does make a clacking sound but it's mild compared to the noises other toys make."
0,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"Cute camera...however it does NOT work. I should have known from start when putting the film in to operating it, nothing was easy. Used the 12 exposure film that came with it and also used a 24 exposure on Christmas Day. Only a hand full of pictures turned out, the rest were double exposures and blanks. I don't think the film advanced right. Santa will be replacing this one."
1,It's a well written book.,My sister introduced me to the Twilight saga and I'm very happy to say that she did. The book was a well written series. There was only one problem that I had with the series and that was the character of Veronica. (If you haven't read the series STOP now!!!) To me the start with the character was that she was unstopable and then in the 3rd book she comes to death in one chapter. To me this seems unfair towards that character and the build up that she was given. Other than that I would highly recommend the series to anyone and trust me it gets addictive. Enjoy!!
0,Very bias,"I am a new, brand new student in philosphy. I didnt like this book. I felt it promoted religion. It was extremly bias and I was offended by him knocking on voltaire. It refused to question anything but his own ideas. Apparently this guy was a pastor? That explains it. I dont want to persuaded into a religious front. This book is supposed to show conflicting viewpoints. It doesn't."
0,Wouldn't have bought it with my own money.,"I have extremely curly and thick hair, down to about my shoulders. My friend gave me this straightener last year because she had 2. At first, it worked pretty well, but soon my hair started getting caught in the corners of the plates and ripping out. Also, it makes the ends of my hair look REALLY damaged, like I have all split ends, and it makes them feel like hay. The top my hair looks pretty good, but I would not replace this straightener if it broke."
1,Mostly flawless Product,"So far my little penguin is blowing out the humidity and bringing a smile to my face whenever I look at it. It does the job nicely, it's easy to assemble, to fill and to operate. My only problem is with the manual. Crane puts out several varieties in the shape of different animals and my manual had photos of another version -- not the penguin I had bought. And the parts differ slightly from each, so you have to do a little guessing as to where things go. Things get figured out fairly quickly, mainly because you keep moving the parts around till they click into place. Anyhow, it's all together now, it works okay and so far, it looks like a winner."
0,ATM Bank,"I had purchased 2 of these for my children for Christmas and neither works, having a horrible time contacting the company for an exchange and ToysRus only takes exchages from Nov 1, I am unfortunate to have shopped early for the gifts!! Waste of time and money, mine of course! No wonder it is discontinued!"
1,MIND BOGGLING,WORK WITH A CO-PARTNER IT IS GREAT YOU BOTH TRY TO SEE WHO CAN FIND THEHIDDEN OBJECTS FIRST. BUT BE CAREFUL THEY WILL FOOL YOU AT EVERY TURNI WAS GLAD I BOUGHT IT AND WILL BUY MORE AS THEY COME OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ALL IN ALL IT IS A GREAT GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0,Why are customers being treated like criminals?,"For one reason or another, EA hasn't learned from its mistakes in the past. I fully intended to buy this game but was disappointed to learn that it was laden with restrictive DRM. Where's my motivation to buy the game when it is in fact simpler to download the game (sans DRM) ""illegally""? Why are the real customers the ones being treated like criminals?"
0,TERRIBLE!!!!!!,"This book was so bad. I mean, they might as well make it a puppet show, bring back Perry"
0,Clueless ( a play on rigging equip),"I was sent the wrong tool. It was not the tool in the picture (the tool I got had no safety latch). I wrote on my return notice that I needed the right tool ASAP, I still havent heard from anyone. I bought 2 locally."
0,Different isn't always good,"Spitalfield's first album is definitely a hit but as for ""stop doing bad thing"" well that's a whole different story it just isn't spitalfield it sounds like a pathetic attempt to go hardcore and it just doesn't work for spitalfield at all don't bother buying this album its garbage and I'm pissed i wasted money buying it stick with ""Remember Right Now"" and don't destroy any respect you have for spitalfield by even listening to their new album"
1,Great Book,"Being a cookbook fanatic and just having had surgery, I was on the prowl for a new cookbook that would help me with my weight loss journey.Boy did I find it. :)My favorite part of this book shows you the serving sizes for each meal for several types of surgery and non-surgery portions. And even a timeline as to when you can eat it.. and how.I have tried several recipes and they are very enjoyable. The cover recipes is especially good.The only thing I caution is that the time frames for many of the dishes are not in accordance with what my doctors advise. However, each doctor is different and you should follow what they say no mater what. The book is only a guideline and can't encompass every doctors wishes."
0,Are you a Maniac for Maniac Magee...(for me it's not joyful),"Maniac was a good book, but, it was a little confusing and hard to keep up with because, he traveled to so many places throught out the whole book. For example, Holidaysburg, Two Mills (*east and west end), Valleyford, and other places in Two Mills. It also was a sad story because, people died for example, Maniacs parents and Grayson. Also his family relationships have died for example, Aunt Dot and Uncle Dan, The Beales, The Pickwells, and the McNabs."
0,Disappointing,"I bought this book because I wanted to learn about Native American customs and practices in a novel format vs. a reference type book. While it did give me some insight into Navajo culture, the book is written at about the 3rd grade level. It was mildly entertaining if you want a no-brainer type of book. But if you want something you can really sink your teeth into, this isn't it. The characters lack depth and the plot is hokey. I wouldn't recommend this book."
1,MOST HONEST AND FUNNY BOOK I EVER READ!,"This book basically throws in your face all the rotten stupid pathetic excuses we give for the jerks in our life and makes you realize that it's not ""ok"" to settle for crap and that it's better to alone then with someone and ""lonely"" ..The book hit home like no other and I recommend this book to any successful, talented, beautiful woman out there who is still asking herself why she keeps attracting losers and accepting less then what she deserves. You will realize that the excuses you've been given to these losers is a joke and that they aren't worth a second more of your time. Thanks Greg and Liz. I love Sex and the City and I LOVE your book! **I just found out that liz's cousin lives in my apt building in Brooklyn and sits next to me on the bus every day, how funny is that"
1,Review of Boomtown,"This is a good CD. It doesn't have some of the favorite songs of Toby Keith, but he is a good singer, and his style comes through here too."
1,Another five-star review,"I first heard this recording when I got it out of the library and found it so incredible that I had to buy it for myself. The sound is warm, not tinny like the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields (the other recording I have, which I've never been terribly fond of), and very expressive. I cannot add any technical comments to the other reviews already written, but I can say that I agree that Trevor Pinnock and Simon Standage are a Baroque musical force to be reckoned with."
0,Well.,"I think that I was happy when it had came in, but it also had a good number of scratches on it which upset my boyfriend, whom I had got it for."
0,poor quality,Air hose has developed small pin holes after only using it a few days. I thought I was buying quality hose! Stay away from this one!
1,Lucky You for Women,My daughter in law wanted this for Christmas so I priced it several places and locally and found more ounces for less money on your site.We were both well pleased.
0,Not received item yet...,"It's been over 4 weeks, and I have not received the DVD yet. I didn't think it was going to take this long. I hope I get it soon; otherwise, I may not buy from this seller again."
1,Good Stuff,"Got this because my friend was an extra in it...hard to find, thanks! Can add it to his demo reel"
1,A little pricy,"I loved the bundle me, but I think the price for them is a little high. I only used it for couple of months, but it would be great if a baby was born right before winter that way it can get good use. Better than any blankets."
0,Great Phone... For A While,"I LOVE this phone... it looks great, it rings just like the old-fashioned phones, and works great FOR AWHILE. I'm on my 4th phone (yes, I'm an idiot, I keep re-buying the same phone again and again... it's about the only one like this on the market) and the exact same thing has happened with every phone. It works great for about 2 months and then one day suddenly the buttons stop working. It can still receive calls, but you can't call out since you can't dial. At first I thought it was a fluke, but all four phones I've purchased have done the exact same thing."
1,Thriller fans need to take this dark ride,"This was one cool flick. Pri - tee darn horrifying what takes place down in that hole, especially as the truth unfolds. There's something extra poignant watching the priviledged lose control of their magic kingdom and suffer the worst by way of some malfunctioning mind's doings. The plot builds as the clock ticks and you become aware you're not really sure of just what happened down there. As you figure it out, you are introduced to one warped a** psyche. If you're a fan of disturbing fare, dig in."
0,Been keeping an eye out ATV Off Road Fury on the PSP,"What a huge let down ATV Off Road Fury for the PSP turned out to be.It would be quicker to list what is right the game, as you've probably guessed, nothing, absolutely nothing is right with it!!!!! And yes, I own a real ATV!!!!!The game is awful, the game is terrible, there is little if nothing right with it. If you have already seen screen shots out there on the web, you'll have an idea of how average it looks, well take it from me, it sounds worse than it looks. The noise that emits from the ATVs is beyond irritating. Looks are not the be all and end all of good games, it is simply a real shame ATV Off Road Fury does not play too well.Sony have really failed to deliver with ATV Off Road Fury. It is still early days for the PSP, so better luck next time Sony. Fingers crossed, lets hope Sony deliver the goods with Grand Turismo 4."
1,A-Rappin' like no other,"No other band can rap like these guys, or get the crowd movin' as much as KMK....i can list so many things about KMK, but i dont have enough room!! If you think their good on CD, try them in consert!"
0,expensive and my dog didnt like it,its difficult to rate dog food. i guess you look at the ingredients and if your dog eats it then its good.well the ingredients were great but my dog didnt like it and its pretty pricey. thats all i can say.
0,"Good Season, Bad DVD","This was a season which returned much closer to the quality of the earlier seasons but that is not what the review will cover.After 7 years of being aired 1.33:1 full frame while their brethren on NBC were upgraded to High-Def, scrubs finally began airing in 16:9 widescreen on ABC during it's Eighth season. If you picked up this DVD you wouldn't think that because the season is not in it's Original Aspect Ratio of 16:9, but once again in a dreary 1.33:1 full frame. This far into the lifespan of DVD there is NO EXCUSE for releasing a title outside of its OAR. It would appear this is some manner of underhanded ploy to force people to buy the Blu-ray in order to watch this season as intended, and I am very disappointed."
1,LOVE THIS DVD,i love the tape. having the artist perform there songs was extra special. Donna really give you a great workout. It is a great pace and you get to work all body parts.
1,Great Graphics!,"This was a great buy for a great price.The graphics were awesome,the owls were so life like.The whole family enjoyed it.My son at 7 was glued to the TV.If you are an animal lover like us, you will like this movie."
1,"Stop Reading, Start Listening","I am not going to wax poetic or prophetic. Rather than foolishly attempt to dissect and analyze something that is far greater than my critical skills, I will simply say this: Stop reading this review and all others on this site (or any site for that matter) and listen to the CD. Any moment spent reading is one that could have been spent listening. And that, my friend, is a loss of some magnitude."
1,One of the best sports movies out there...,"Hoosiers is the tale of disgraced college basketball coach Norman Dale (Hackman), as he leads a small town high school team in Indiana to glory, battling biased fans, drunk assistant coaches and the system along the way.This is a quality sports movie, which cannot be said about many, and with solid work from many smalltime actors is made into a memorable one. The small town story resembles that of Larry Bird's rise to fame as a Boston Celtic, and this is a movie you will want to watch many more times."
1,Great album,I enjoy different types of music and this was a must have for my collection. If you like this genre of music you will enjoy this album.
1,Jumper review,I have a penchant for fiction/fantasy novels with identifiable characters who are either given exceptional gifts or placed into unusual situations. I thoroughly enjoyed Jumper and Reflex and am anxiously awaiting Impulse.
0,"Unacceptable color ""calibration""","I tried the Huey on several pc's, using several different monitors(CRT and LCD). In every case, the colors were severely off. Defective unit? Possibly, however I believe that the Huey is just not up to par. Unlike other calibrators, the Huey doesn't help you manually correct your monitor. Instead, it does some display tests, and makes adjustments through software(the profile it created) to get the desired effect. In other words, it doesn't calibrate your monitor at all, it simply adjusts your pc's video output. Unfortunately, this method doesn't seem to work well.I would suggest spending a little more and getting the Spyder2. It will actually help you adjust your monitor, not just ""calibrate"" through software."
0,I'VE SEEN IT... ITS RUBBISH...,"Mostly awful...sorry guys.But I've been following the guide for over 20 years now.Having read the series and have the BBC version...and this is the worst incarnaton yet.The BBC version,though it looks like it was done in a garage,blows this little bit of Vogon poetry away.Sci-fi and humor require more than special effects and hype to work.I know that watching this sputum is easier than having to read...but come on!The magic of the guide is that all the bizarre loose ends come together, in the end...sort of.The bizarre loose ends here, go off and are never seen...or referred to, again.Only a dyed in the wool Golgafrinchamian would find this load of dingos kidneys amusing.Could have been so much better...sad really.But still...rent it anyway,just to see how much something can suck."
0,Disapointed.....,I'm very disappointed. The product is cheap and defective. Pump does not work. Return is almost as expensive as the product.
1,Inspiring!,"If you need a little motivation to reorganize your sewing or craft space, this is a great book. The photos are plentiful, and there are lots of good ideas for storage and work surfaces, no matter how much space you can devote to it. Let it inspire you to create your own dream sewing space."
0,Doesn't work if the crossbars are missing,The description is misleading as it says works on drains with broken crossbars. Not true. It's too small to get a grip on it. It will just spin in the drain while turning.

1,This is great,"I have a sailboat and often need to cut SS wire. My regular wire cutters will only cut thin wire, but this one works much better and I just used it on lifeline wire of 3/16"" and it cut cleanly. Great cutter."
1,AEM intake,"The AEM intake is worth the money if you wanna get rid of the stock air box and add some ""bling"" and get a little power in higher rpm range, also it's one of the most common upgrades for rx8 owners finally got mines and I'm loving it. The price is by far the cheapest I've seen on the internet for this product in new condition, and I searched every where forums, store, on+off/line, and this is the cheapest if you have an rx8 and you want to do a cold air intake I suggest the AEM and if you decide to go turbo later on you reuse the piping from the AEM CAI."
1,Great stories for a great pirce.,Seems like there are more and more Poirot fans introduced dailey. I've been hooked ever since I saw the first one.
1,Good intro for a novice,"This is a very good book for a high school economics 101 course. This book should be read by every high school student. The ideas are put forth in a very straight foward manner that is almost too easy to understand. If you have any knowledge about ecomomics, do not get this. You will be board with the concepts Gordon goes over."
0,If you like hot coffe don't but this,"I normally don't write reviews, and heck, I didn't even buy this through Amazon, but I would like to warn all who consider this machine to reconsider. This coffeemaker will keep your coffe nice and WARM without extra power for the heater element. But alas, I like my coffee HOT not WARM. Right after brewing the coffee is not hot anymore, even if you follow the separately included warning to pre-heat the caraffe with hot water for 5 minutes. (Yeah right, who has time for that in the morning, just make me a coffeemaker that works!) I would expect a little better for the price. Also the caraffe has a terrible tout to pour the coffee, and everytime you pull out the caraffe water drips all over the machine. What is up with this thing, I thought this is all you do for a living Mr.Coffee !? Get it right next time."
1,WOW!,"So much better than I expected! I have to admit, I was a little skeptical about the ""cord thing"" but it is SO MUCH EASIER to use than any gas powered machine I have used - EVER! It pushes more easily than the self-prepelled and not having to spend the first 20 minutes of the day trying to start the thing, it just makes mowing go so fast!Not to mention, no gas or oil when you tilt it. And it stops immediately when you let go of the handle and starts right back up when you grab it again! FAB-U-LOUS!LOVE IT!"
0,Throw it out and forget it.,"After about 15 uses over the duration of one year the machine quit working due to an electronic melt down. It was very difficult, if not impossible, to clean and squealed like a stuck pig. The chicken was very good but as it should have been when you consider that it cost over one hundred and fifty dollars plus to cook 15 chickens. Before it burns down your house, do as it did and ""Throw it out and forget it"""
1,love my Honeywell HY-048BP tower fan,this is my second Honeywell tower fan; I enjoyed my first one so much that when I needed to buy a new one I researched to find one just like it. It gives out a good stream of air and isn't too loud either.I'd definitely buy another one and have recommended it to several of my friends.
1,very charming book,"Excellent and funny book with a lot of illustrations. I purchased it about 10 years ago in USA with Jim Kepner's ""Becoming a people..."" and Terry Boughner's ""Out of All Time"". They are very nice and intersting volumes. In these books, however, we can find only the occidental people with few exceptions ; e.g. Mishima Yukio, Suleiman . Though English has become nowadays as if a kind of LINGUA FRANCA , I don't understand why the English speaking people still have such a narrow-minded thinking. I'd like to read more international, global and comprehensive books.PS : Noel I. Garde's ""Jonathan to Gide : The Homosexual in History"" also is a very intersting book of ""The Gay-people's List"" , although it is on the westerners including some Oriental men like Abu Nuwas and Saladin."

1,Most underrated blues based rock/metal album.,"This has GOT to be one of the most under rated blues based rock/metal albums of all time. Cinderella rocks in their finest tradition in this body of work. Why is this still not in print? Makes no sense to me. Beg, borrow or steal a copy and you won't be sorry if you are a true Cinderalla fan. I surely hope Tom's voice improves well enough to put out one more album of this caliber. By the way, Cinderalla sounds as good live as they do in the studio! I saw them at the House of Blues in Chicago and they ROCKED. Never heard a bad sound so close to their studio sound. They really do sound exactly like on their CDs, unlike most bands. And they still look cool too. :-)S.C.Chicagoland"
1,band is tiny,"Every feature of this is great, except that the wristband is tiny. My wrists are not very thick at all, but I can only get the buckle to the second hole, and that's pretty tight. Be prepared to get a bigger band."
1,Absolutely Splendid,"Again, a wonderful work of James Martin, SJ. This collection of essays - which, I believe, originally appeared in America Magazine - written by a variety of men, women, religious and lay is very inspirational and educational. A great read!"
0,"Nothing ""Best"" about it.","I have been trying different litters over the last few months on a hunt for one that clumps well, doesn't end up tracked all over the house, and doesn't reek after our one male cat does his business.Imagine corn bread soaked in day old cat wee, and multiply by at least ten, and you have approximately the stink created by this litter after only a week. (And I do scoop every day!) It takes ages for the clumps to harden, and if you scoop before they do you end up with tiny little balls of funk that fall right through the scooper.After only ten days I threw the whole smelly mess out and moved on to the Dr. Elseys brand, which is nice but I think I will go back to the Feline Pine Scoop after this.Overall, totally disappointed and I can't believe how much this terrible product costs!"
0,small brush is too hard!,"I bought this solely for the nipple brush since I couldn't find one sold by itself easily. I think the nipple brush is unusable. The bristles are so hard and sharp I'm not willing to use it on the nipples because it might damage them. In fact, I think I see scratches on the pump parts that I've cleaned it with. You can see in the picture the bristles don't go all the way to the top which also reduces its usefulness."

0,Not worth the money,We initially purchased this item as a Christmas gift for my daughter. It is very cute but very flimsy and the bar/handle would not hold the seat in a sitting position (it kept slipping). I ended up finding another doll carseat at a store and ended up giving that one to her instead. We will be returning this one.
1,The Giver,"Jonas is a boy who lives in a perfect society. He is eleven waiting for his job assignment, which is announced to the entire community at the twelve's ceremony. While he waits to find out what his job is with his friends, Asher and Fiona, he does volunteer work at places like the house of the Old and the Nurturing center to help the committee decide what his job will be. But when he gets his assignment he realizes why he must live in a perfect society and why he was given this job. Jonas also realizes why there are so many ""community rules"" he must follow. One night Jonas decides to escape and find out what its like in the real world, but he has never cooked a meal in his life! Will Jonas make it? Will he ever find out what its like being able to make your own choices? Find out in The Giver, by Lois Lowry."

0,COLLAR REPLACED 3 TIMES IN ONE YEArR,"I PURCHASED THIS BLENDER TO MAKE FROZEN DRINKS. WITHIN ONE YEAR (1) THE COLLAR BROKERTHREE (3) TIMES. I WOULD RATE THIS BLENDER A 5 IF THE COLLAR DIDN'T CONSTANTLY SHATTER AS A RESULT OF CRUSHING ICE. IF YOU ARE BRAVE ENOUGH TO PURCHASE THIS ITEM, CHECK THE COLLAR FOR HAIRLINE BREAKS. THE BREAKS ARE NOT OBVIOUS UNTIL LIQUID COMES FLOWING OUT OF THE MODELS BASE."

0,Please don't confuse this w/ R&B/Urban hip hop!,"The CD is ridicolous and embarrassing. I can only laugh and imagine How in THE HELL did he get a record deal, less more a hit on top 40 radio. I am so thankful that radio stations that I listen to don't play this garbage. STAY AWAY FROM THIS CD IT IS TRASH, WHICH IS WHERE IT BELONGS!"
0,Lost in translation,"I rented this film and forced my best friend to watch this with me after hearing all this fan faving on the film. I'm open to new experiences. In return, I got nothing. This is the work of genius? This is nothing but a strange and weird animation. First clue to the reviewer that giving tips on how to watch this movie: a movie shouldn't need cliff notes. Nothing, and I do mean nothing in this film makes one ioda of sense to me and I can't believe I'm wasting more time in posting a review this garbage."
1,very good record and performance.,Very good record and performance. If any people interested on old music you have to buy it. This is a old music on a new record. But very difficult to find this label in any store.

1,Goose Girl,"Goose Girl is a exciting book. Ani is a princess, who is knocked off her post by her lady-in-waiting and the soldiers who support her.When she finally gets to the kingdom where her betrothed husband, is her lady-in-waiting is already there acting as her in her place.Then she lives as a goose girl to make money.While she is doing that she meets a guard named Gridic. As for the rest u will have to find out for u'r self. i recommend this book for everyone."
1,Songs deeply engraved in the history of music,"""Make it Big"" launched the careers of two of the 80s' biggest international sex symbols - George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley. Youthfulness and strong melodies are richly woven resulting in beautiful songs like ""Heartbeat"", ""Everything she wants"", ""Freedom"" and ""Wake me up before you go go"" - the guiltiest pleasure of all time. The album ends with the smooth and sexy ""Careless Whisper"" - a timeless classic and a sneak preview of the music and career of one of the greatest solo artists of all time."
0,Don't waste your're money if you want info beyond Notes 4.6,"Don't waste your're money if you want info beyond Notes 4.6. The Notes 5.0 early beta used in this book briefly, is just that. The info is really irrelevant to the gold 5.0 release. Change the title of the book, they should not promise Notes 5.0 info because it just does not measure up."
0,Ugh,"Wow. Vanilla Ice thinks he's Korn. And with Korn's producer behind the boards on this one, who's to tell him he isn't? Though the drums pound and the guitars roar, no amount of hard-rock trimmings can hide the painfully obvious: the Ice still can't rap. He proved it recently with his unintentionally hilarious cameo on the last Bloodhound Gang album. Hell, he proved it with ""To the Extreme."" The scary thing is that ""Hard to Swallow"" has actually been selling decently. Personally, listening to this entire CD was a grueling experience; I had to fight the temptation to tear it out of my stereo and put on something more stimulating. Like the Spice Girls. Or that CD of cats meowing Christmas carols. Anything but this. So bad that it makes Limp Bizkit look positively brilliant."
0,I'm on the fence with this one,I didn't like this book but also I didn't really not like it. I can't think of anything in it that I really enjoyed other then the kind of hinted at love triangle. I think I am going to read book two just to see if they get better. Can't really explain why I am intrigued with them. They aren't my usual style. I thought it was a little raunchy not really romantic at all. I think I kind of like Sookies character and I want to know what happens with her. To see how this whole Bill Sam thing works out. I would only suggest this book to certain good humored friends.
1,Labunski's Important Book,"I heartily recommend Richard Labunski's thoughtful and carefully researched book, ""The Second Constitutional Convention."" Our Constitution is probably the most revered document in U.S. history. Yet it was written long before automobiles, airplanes, telephones, or the Internet, and a lot has changed in our country. Labunski's point is that, when Congress refuses to obey the will of the people because of special-interest campaign money, for instance, we have a recourse: Though difficult, we can initiate the process of calling a new constitutional convention to revise the Constitution, so that it is, once again, of, by, and for The People."
0,Table/Chair Set,"Product quality a disappointment. Flaws in finish require better inspection before shipping, and if incurred in transit, mandate much better packaging. Some work required during assembly to correct holes too small to accept screws.Would not order this product unless you have good tools and can do some repair to finished surfaces."
0,DON'T DO IT!!!,"I thought that this gate looked so secure and safe, especially since it had mesh instead of hard metal bars to prevent climbing and injury. Was I wrong! My husband, who is very mechanically-inclined put the gate together. Once it was up, I pulled on the mesh; the tension doesn't stay tight, it sags considerably. But the worst part is even with maximum tension applied, if you put a little bit of pressure on the gate, the whole thing slides back and forth. There is no way I am going to use this gate, it is completely unsafe and would fall onto my baby if she tried to pull up on it. I guess it would be fine for a baby who doesn't touch anything, ever."
0,Nearly destroyed my back,"I tried this one night. It's just too narrow and tall to support the arch in my back smoothly - in other words, it holds a small part of my arch unnaturally above the rest.I went back to a towel, which I can customize to my back.I've been trying to sleep on my back. Then I found that when I slept flat on my back, it hurt because the arch wasn't being supported. That's why I bought this. At this point I've been trying to use the towel, but I'm also going back to sleeping on my side sometimes."
0,Coulda Been Really Great,"Here's a book that has a great premise and interesting characters, but was poorly executed. The author jumps back and forth introducing multiple characters, and skips big chunks of critical action. I actually checked page numbers to see if I had a misprinted copy and missed something.There's also some incredible coincidences that stretch belief even within the realm of a fantasy/science fiction genre. The fact that several groups of random strangers who meet all possess rare and improbable skills such as blacksmithing, swordsmithing, archery, and bowmaking was just too much."
1,Amazing,"Missy Suicide is indeed a genius. People who aren't in the mainstream often tend to be looked down upon because they aren't understood, often meaning they can't be beautiful. Missy and the Suicide Girls out to prove everyone who might thing that wrong."
0,tedious,"Although I have enjoyed Paretsky's other books, the plot of this one was too complicated, with too many characters. The political/historical commentary about the blacklisting in the 1950's was especially tedious. And, the final resolution was rather unbelievable. Overall, the novel would have been more enjoyable in a shorter, cleaner version."
1,Great personal heater,"This heater is super quiet and blows out a steady stream of warm air. I always have to have air blowing on me, and I find that ceramic heaters are either too hot or too loud. This heater is whisper quiet and perfect for chilly nights."
1,We love this game!,"This is our favorite game. It's an easy game to learn, but it has a lot of depth and strategy to it. The expansion games ""Cities & Knights"" & ""Seafarers"" adds even more complexity without turning it into a chore to play. If we were could take only one game on a deserted island, I'd pick one that had an inflatable raft inside, but I'd hope this game was in the raft for the journey home."

1,This is the best album of all time,"When i listen to this album over and over again i come to realize that although it does not have 1 song better then the best song on enter the wu tang it has a total of #14 pretty darn good songs. Enter the wu tang used to be the best rap album of all time to me but as good as that album is i only like about #6 songs on it. This album has some of the grittiest beats and shows WU Tang at their mighty best. The best song on this album to me is not Triumph. The best song is cash still rules/scary hours. But this album is laced with unbelievable songs like, For heavens sake, itz yours, cash still rules, visions, as high as wu tang get, severe punishment, Unbelievable lyrics in a better tomorrow, triumph, MGM, hells wind staff, sick beat on impossible. I love this album i have 3 copies!!"
1,Turtledove's best book so far,"I normally enjoy books by Harry Turtledove, but this one is much funnier than the rest. It's fast-moving and the humour is nearly British. I really hope that he will write more books like this one!"
0,Disappointed,I was looking for ideas and inspirations for Crazy Quilts. This book was very disappointing.
1,Interesting to read,"I'm married and got this more for fun than anything. I disagree with many parts but it does have some information that I thought was good and useful and that I will in fact use, but in a non-manipulative manner. The hardcover price is outrageous, but the paperback price is reasonable."
0,Stupid,"This is an absolutely absurd movie, with a stupid storyline, bad characters, bad character development and a really dumb predictable ending. /yawn"
0,Protects screen but not click wheel area,I purchased this product soon after I bought my ipod. Had even left the annoying shrink wrap on until I had a proper case... The result? Two months of use and huge gouges in the face near the click wheel. Even upon slipping the ipod into the case the first time some scratching occured across the click wheel. The case fits much tighter on the lower half of the ipod with a gap between the face of the screen and the case. Through normal use the occasional piece of sand/pocket [...] worked its way into the case. Since there is no way to remove the ipod other than slipping it in and out I watched in horror as the scratches occurred in the process.Other negatives:-Case adds alot of width to the ipod-Opening in bottom not sufficient for connection to Belkin auto adapter.Solution:Use the Apple supplied case..you're much better off
0,The most depressing read of 2001,"The hype was better than this book. The worst episode of OPRAH ever videotaped is better than this book. The manual that came with my blender is better than this book. Yes, I finished it -- because I spent hard-earned cash on it. What a waste of time. Depressing, overwritten, with not an ounce of humanity. SKIP IT!"
1,Qualtiy at a bargain price,"I've always like Sony products because they provide consistent quality and performance. These headphones are no exception. They are light weight, comfortable, and the sound is very natural with solid clean bass. I would have appreciated a little more background isolation though. They probably don't work well in noisy environments. But, for home use they work well and are easy on the pocketbook."
1,Very Good....!,"First of all....BUY IT!!!Burnout 3 has some of the best graphics out, the cars are detailed very well and the game moves extremely fast!! (Especially when boosting!!)Some of the physics are a tad odd..! Like when one of the SLOW cars can do 0 - 60 in 1 second...but you'll only notice them if you're being picky!There is a feature called Burnout3 World tour. In this you can do a wide range of things, from Crashes, Racing, Takedown, Head to Head etc. There are a lot of the crashing games in World tour so it can get a little bit annoying/boring.The only sad thing is that you can't do anything to the cars, can't tune it, can't pimp it although you can change the colour!! (How great is that?!) And it does take a long time to get into the game. I mean you start off with a pathetic car, and it isn't all that fun, but when you start unlocking things it suddenly becomes more interesting.It also comes equipped with ""Net Play"" (which although I haven't got, is extremely fun)Like I said BUY IT!!"
0,This game is a gimmick!!!!,The levels are SO HARD to beat! The graphics are awful! It's the worst GBA game I have! It's a big gimmick! Don't make the same mistake that I have made!
1,beautful words,"This is my favorite cd of 2001. Yes the beat could have been different but the words are so beautiful and Christina's voice is very beautful, she sings in this album with a passion and she even wrote the words so of course I gave her all the stars that I could give her in this rating. I think that ""Just Be Free"" the song rather than the album of the same title was written when she was young and that the rest of the songs on the album were written in 2001. Since she's with a new record company after sueing her old record company she must have had a say wheter or not this album was released. She never had a cd released in fall of 2001 like she supposedly said that she would. ""Believe me"" is my favorite song on this cd. I'm probably your biggest male fan now. I'm 26 years old and I like this new style of yours much better than the old one. Christina you go girl !!!!"
1,A bit big,"I was looking for something smaller. This is a bit big and bulky, but it serves it's purpose well and I have not had any problems with it."
1,Kitchen Confidential - amazing show!,"When I heard that there had been a comedy TV series based on Anthony Bourdain's Kitchen Confidential, starring Bradley Cooper and also featuring Jaime King, Nicholas Brendon, John Francis Daley, and John Cho... I got extremely excited. Hopped immediately on Amazon and ordered it second-day delivery.The show is funny and intelligent. The acting is amazing. Even jokes that perhaps wouldn't work on other shows are pulled off through the delivery and the fact that they doesn't try too hard. They make the joke and move on... meaning you're left laughing hysterically instead of rolling your eyes.Introduced the show to two friends so far, and they both love out. One friend went out and purchased it that same night.Fantastic!"
0,Remington shaver screens,"Will never buy another Remington product unless it's a shotgun. Within two weeks of buying a MS5100 Remington electric shaver, the screen broke. I ordered a replacement set of Remington screens from Amazon, and within two days, it broke. Amazon=good Remington=bad"
1,Great CD,"This cd shows how the group has matured since the raw sixteen stone. Yes you have commercial favorite hits such as chemicals between us, but spacetravler 40mil from the sun, prize fighter and letting the cables sleep are are real strong songs that the group has ever done . this album has really set the new standard for grunge."
1,Exciting Book! Adventure in Every Chapter!,"This wonderful book teaching tolerance, acceptance and understanding and the value of dependence on one another is a required reading book in 6th grade in our schools. The children enjoy the book and learn a great deal about survival in the woods! Excellent page turning adventures between an Native American Indian and a boy.Evelyn Horan - teacher/..."
1,The Erasure I Know and Love.,"This is a really good album and I would definitely recommend it to any Erasure fan. It's not as good as their very best, but definitely as good as their second best albums. It has about three memorable songs and the others are enjoyable too."
0,poor quality,"Coffee maker leaks all the time, flooding out kitchen floor. No matter how carefully we align the carafe, there is coffee all over the kitchen counter..."
0,Wait,"This was a very disappointed reader. After reading RJ's books over the years I have slowly started to feel a sharp bitterness with his work. Mind I will read his work until his last book is published, but not with the same passion I once did. In Crossroads of Twilight, as in Winters Heart, the story seems to fade. It just seems that RJ is writing so that he can write another book. I won't give away plot or story line, but to say all the main players appear, though Rand isn't seen until three hundred pages in. Few questions are answered, though more are asked. And the end leaves you so twisted you feel like tossing the book across the room. With the probability that the next book won't come out till late 2005 this reader feels disheartened with ever seeing an end to what once was epic series with outstanding depth. Remember it started out as a series of only six books."
1,Quick service,Got the package sooner than expected. It was packaged great compared to things i've ordered through ebay. I'd purchase more movies from here. Love the movie so i had to buy it!
1,Great Bike Rack,"Bought this rack on Monday and it got here on Tuesday. Took about 30-45 minutes to put it all together. Once I figured out that I had to take some parts apart to put them back together on the rack base, it all went well. I love how the bikes mount and feel that the bikes are more secure than on the type of racks that the bikes hang from the top tube. I would defiantly recommend this bike rack."
0,"This is just an ""OK"" product","This seat cover is a great idea if it were only big enough! I doesn't cover enough of the seat to protect it. It in my opinion needs to go higher up on the seat. I would also caution parents about thinking that there car seat is in tight enough because of the grippers. make sure even when using this that your car seat moves no more that 1"" AT THE MOST in ANY direction! I would also recomend the Sunshine Kids Mighty Tite to all. It is a wonderful and easy to use product that will keep your car seat from budging even and inch!"
0,TX6U Wireless Temperature Sensor,I could not get this product to work with the La Crosse WS-8035U-IT Wireless 915mhz Forecast Station as it was advertised to do. After several hours of trying to get it to work I finally gave up in frustration. Had I known that this would be the case I would never have purchased either item.
0,Does not hold up,"Yes, this bed is a good price. It can be washed at home. It does not hold up well at all. It pills up and gets all over the carpet. I would not recommend."
1,Interesting read,"This book was recommended by a neighbor as new residents to Coastal Georgia. As a former teacher, I was amazed at the tale told in this story. It is heart wrenching with details of the life that was during this time. Mr. Conroy's writing style, humor, and perspective makes for a book that is hard to put down. It is a story of following what you know is the right thing to do no matter the adversity you are up against."
0,'Necronomicon' Is Ridiculous!!!!,"Being an H. P. Lovecraft fan, I bought a copy of this latest travesty of the _Necronomicon_ more on impulse than anything else. How supposedly intelligent people could become beguiled by such obvious and juvenile tripe is more than a rational person can endure. I even went so far - again, purely for reasons of amusement - as to actually try out some of the incantations, spells, and even some of the more 'dreaded' (HAR! HAR!) keys. Now, as I sit here at my computer typing this, I am embarrassed to admit that I committed such a waste of time. But I must be honest with .. hmmm .. what's that scratching at the windowpane? Can't be sure because of the dark and the rain .. Wait! .. I hear shattering glass .. that tentacle! .. the three-lobed burning eye! .. AAAAAHHHHHHRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHH!"
1,Great video!,"My 5 1/2 month old son loves this video. Of the three we have, the baby and I by far enjoy this one the most. It is always set in the VCR prepared for cranky time to settle him down. It is the perfect 30 minute babysitter so I can get some stuff done. Of the three-Mozart, Bach, and Einstein (I have not seen Shakespeare yet)- Mozart is by far the best. If you are a consumer trying to decide which one to buy, the decision has been made. Buy this one!"
0,Worked for a few months,"My bro gave this to my mom as all her oldies are on cassette. It worked for about 5 months or so. I don't recall exactly how many months, but not even a year. It started chewing the tapes. I am technical and tried to see if the rubber was out of alignement etc. I messed with it, and it still continues to eat the tapes. I'm going with a known brand this time thus I'm hear searching for another one, and definetely want to give Coby potential customers the real heads up."
0,disapointing!!!,"Only two songs are great Desire, All I want is you!!!There are some good live performaces, but Helter Skelter, and All along the watch tower covers were very bad moves!!!If you're a die hard fan, buy this for the two songs I mentioned because they're classics, but otherwise this is hardly essential!!!"
0,Lasted a few months,"The plastic inside broke, for some reason. For its price, I was surprised at how shotty the workmanship was. Will not buy this brand again. Total disappointment."

1,"Amazing, beyond what i imagined.","I absolutely love this lense. I haven't even had it a day and already I've taken amazing pictures. Even though I'm an amateur photographer i found it very simple to figure out the way things worked with this camera. There aren't really directions to how to use it in the packaging but all i had to do was google how to use it with my d40 and in minutes i was shooting gorgeous pictures. Very good for taking photos of pets and kids, even sporting events. Amazing deal for the price i payed. You get way more than you pay for with this lense."
1,Not too shabby,"It was pretty good. Thought it got lost in the military mail system, but it still got here faster than I thought it would."
0,DO NOT WAST YOUR MONEY!!,"You only get three events on two disc, each event only has 4 fights on it. I paid $20 for 12 fights. You can buy one UFC dvd for cheaper and still get more fights. What a wast of money. You can catch Strikeforce on Showtime for free anyways. Save your money!!"
1,Really Nice Desktop Sound,"I just got this unit after deciding not to purchase the Altec Lansing inMotion iM3 based on an in-store sound test.The sound quality of the JBL On Stage was vastly superior -- IMHO -- than any of the other small-speaker iPod units available and though it didn't have a remote at my preferred price point (the reason for 4 of 5 stars), the full bass sound really set these speakers apart from the others.The JBL On Stage will provide enough sound to fill a room but one has to remember that these are small speakers and they will probably not satisfy the discriminating audiophile.However, the JBL On Stage is the perfect set of speakers for my desktop at work and the fact that my nano plugs right in and charges while playing is terrific.This is a great set of beautiful sounding speakers."
0,Pointless plot with miserable and depressed characters,"Patricia Cornwell is one of my favorite authors, but lighten up! Next time I want to wallow in something this depressing I'll just lock myself in a dark room and repeat over and over ""life sucks and then you die"". At least the mantra gets to the point."
1,Great pot!,This multi-purpose set is great for cooking everything from pasta to steamed veggies! Love it!
0,What Jason Moss did on his summer vacation.,"This would have been an excellent book if Jason Moss had written an introduction, and we could have actually read the letters he talks about so much in a very general way. I found his writing style to be very bland and I did not relate to him and his ego at all."
0,Political Correctness butchers an interesting subject,"Through his political correctness, Mr. Olson spoils an interesting subject! His message, repeated over and over again is: As all mankind has been interbreeding time over time, we are all the same, and therefore racism is unfounded!He does not seem to realise, what a dangerous road he is leading his readers down with this politically correct message: What if future science proofs, that his thesis is wrong, that there ARE substantial genetic differences between people - after all, this is a new science? ( I personally think, this is not so, but what does my belief mean...)People would use his very argument to justify discrimination, with the same vigor Mr. Olson is using.Non-discrimination must and does have a different, an ethical basis!"
0,"Tired, sloppy rendition","This book covers some pretty tired terrain in Marketing -- providing value for consumers. The delivery is dry and the examples are old. It would have helped if at least one of the authors had either some business experience or provided some academic insights. As it lies, it's obvious that the authors have little or none of the former and lack academic rigor as well: for example, several of the concepts appear poorly defined. It's clear from amazon.com's popularity/sales index that the book is used at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (where the second author serves as director of the MBA program); it's equally obvious that this book is unknown and unheralded any where else."
0,A complete failure,"I consider this recording to be a complete failure. Russell Watson simply fails to do any justice to the music. It's ironic that he and his record company are promoting Watson as a versatile singer. The fact, as can obviously be heard from this recording, is that Watson does everything badly. Surely not a mark of versatility!"
0,This toy is horrible!,"I don't understand why anyone would WANT this toy after giving it to my 5-year-old. The hair is a horrible tangled mess that even I can't get a comb through. The water has to be very cold or very hot for it to work at all to make the color change. several of the hair clips and the nail polish bottle came broken. The hair, however, is the biggest disappointment. There is NO WAY my child will be able to style it because it is so messy and tangled. A big waste of money."
0,Does not compare to the original,"As we all know, this release of ""In Times Before The Light"" is a re-issued version of the original recording. The original version of this album is incredible. I am lucky enough to own a copy. The reason they re-issued the album is because they shared the same name as a band from Sweden. Beacuase of this they were forced to change their name to The Kovenant. After the name changed, unfortunately so did the bands sound. This not being a good change at all. If you do ever get to hear / own a copy of the original Black Metal version, listen to that rather than this. As another reviewer stated, the whole atmoshpere of the original recording has been lost. The album doesn't feel the same."
0,AliceSmack,"First off I would like to say that some of Godsmack songs at one point in my life sounded ok, but being that the lead singer tries so hard at sounding like my favorite singer and in my opinion one of the most brilliant human being of all time, Layne Staley R.I.P. it makes me sick. Sully could never come close to Layne, no one will ever and thats a given fact. Isn't Godsmack the track on Alice in Chain's album Dirt? Oh I'm sorry it was God Smack. Even if the band started as a AIC cover band it really makes me sick that they try to pose or atleast Sully after two albums. This album to me is almost an insult and smack at the late Alice In Chains. Actually every album of this band to me is. I'm sorry,but being a die hard Alice In Chains fan it just annoys me when I hear this band. I wonder how many more lyrics of Laynes is Sully gonna try to swindle. If you want a real great albumthan try anything from Alice In Chains, Madseason, or any other great band that emerged from the Seattle scene."
0,Disappointing !,"Titanic Disaster in the Atlantic, had nothing whatsoever to do with the TITANIC. It bore a minute resemblance to the story in the sense that a passenger liner sank in the Atlantic, there the similarity ends. David McCallum looked decidedly uncomfortable introducing this, which I can only describe as drivel. The TITANIC Chronicles however was mildly entertaining in the sense that it contained eye witness accounts of the disaster. In my opinion the saving grace of this DVD."
1,Move over Dracula,"This book definetly falls into BEST BOOK EVER READ catergory. But seriously, this book is suspensful, exciting, and humorous, all rolled up into one package. Aubrey and Risika are people Dracula can't even compare with. See vampires in a new light. They're world goes so much deeper than ""I want to suck your blood."""
0,disappointed,"My 14yo daughter, an avid reader of at least 4 books per month, was underwhelmed with this book. She loves to read books before seeing the movies based on them and this is the first time she has expressed this measure of disinterest. She read the book in less than 2 afternoons/evenings, waiting for the story to strenthen... It never happened. Now she says she doesn't even care to see the movie. Wow..."
0,didn't work for me - IBS,"Apparently the SCD diet is great for UC and Crohn's, but it did nothing for me. I've had IBS D for a long time, and though I stuck to this pretty religiously for about a month and a half, I saw no improvement. I may try it again after the holidays, but it seems that for most people, there is noticeable improvement immediately, so I got discouraged when I didn't see any."
1,Very comprehensive and informative,I love to garage sale and estate sale and find a lot of Noritake so decided to learn more. You would just not believe how many patterns there are! Very interesting and now I can be a more informed shopper. The price guide is very helpful as well.
1,The light at the end of a very long tunnel!,"I have been suffering with chronic fatigue for most of my life. 7 years ago we thought that we had found a medication that would work, but to my dismay stopped after about a year. It has been a very long battle ever since. I am a motivated person, but my illnesses always threw road blocks up on every path I tried to follow. I finally sunk into a desperate depression thinking that this is what life was going to be like for me. This book was a godsend, validating all of my feelings, concerns, worries, anxieties, aches and pains. And showing me that there is help available and life doesn't have to be this way. It is like the light at the end of a very long, dark tunnel!"
0,Quite possibly your single biggest mistake in life!,Seagul doesn't live in reality. The most successful sites on the Web are successful because of their content. I wouldn't count any sites listed in this book as a true success. Successful sites get millions of hits each month NOT per year. Successful sites are generating millions in revenues.Sadly you are doing yourself a great disservice if you listen to any of the advice in this book. Instead of buying garbage. I recommend you get a well written book that focuses on content and design. Two of the best Web books available today are Weinman's Designing Web Graphics.2 and Stanek's Web Publishing Unleashed Professional. Both books are a much better investment of your time and money.
1,Very Nice Scanner,I'm surprised to hear that some people had negative comments about Pacific Image customer support. Their website offers updated downloads including a PDF of each model's manual. I have never had trouble with my scanner so I had no reason to contact customer support but if you are looking for a review of this product from someone who has used then I have to say it is one of the best scanners I have used. Check out Pacific Image's website [...] for more info on their scanners.
1,Nice fit and look,"These shoes look great on my 4 year old son, and the 11 1/2 fit him very well with a little bit of room to grow. They are very nice quality."
0,I did not find it simple and handy!,First of all this book is not simple at all. I was looking for something which is easy to use. These kinds of books should be easy reference points. It means whenever there is a need for a cure you should be able to look inside to find the problem from the list and the answer below it. In this book it is almost not possible to find out how to treat your complaint. The book is so complicated that I was lost in details that I do not need to know and no answer to my questions at the end!
1,Pride & Prejudice,"Pride & Prejudice is simply a great romantic movie. As a ""male"" movie viewerI was skeptical of the ability of this movie to draw me into it's story. My wife talked me into itand I am glad that I did. Terrific acting, interesting social predicaments ( Jane Austin truly chronicles the pitfals of an male dominated, upper class society),Wonderful music( I ended up getting the soundtrack) and scenery too."
1,Fun Summer Read,"Another great read from Julia Quinn just in time for summer reading! As always, I love the characters with their usual humor and engaging dialogue."
1,Great escapism,"Not all books have to be plausible or loaded with heavy, hidden meaning, as some of the other reviewers indicate. I greatly enjoyed the story line, the characters, and the complexity of the situations Alex found himself in - not unlike problems most of us find ourselves in (at least to some degree, if not in Hollywood or on a national level). I was sorry to finish it; I also ordered the author's next novel."
0,Isn't working for my dog.,"Putting the bed together was ok. However, I found that the legs could shift when you pick up the bed from one side. We had gotten the bed because our dog kept digging to find a cooler place to lay. Our dog is about 70lbs and fit fine on the bed. He seemed to like it for a few days. Then he started tipping the bed up and digging underneath it. The hole got deep enough to where he could lay in the hole with the bed covering him for shade. Later he tipped the bed over and got his cable wrapped around it and somehow managed to pull the legs apart. So now we still have a hole in the yard and a bed in pieces."
0,Piece of crap,"This is horrible. It is cheap plastic and mine does not work. If you are lucky enough that it does light up it is so dim you can only see it from a foot away. If you return it you loose your shipping cahrges 11.99 and are charged a restocking fee.Save your money. The old saying fits here ""you get what you pay for"""
1,Braun 5790 shaving system,"I replaced a Norelco rotary shaver with the Braun. I liked the idea of a shaver being cleaned, sanitized and charged after each shave so I bought the Braun. So far, it shaves much closer than my Norelco. The shaver is not quite as ""mobile"" as the Norelco due to its shape and it is noisier than my Norelco, but it is comfortable on my face and does a good job. The cleaning system works well but is also noisy for about 5 minutes. You do have to replace the cleaning fluid cartridge after every so many cleanings, but that doesn't entail a lot of money. All in all, I like the shaver and would buy it again. I do use a pre-shaving fluid on my face and it seems to help with the closeness of the shave."
1,"Historically inaccurate, but fun!","You throw the history book away when you watch this series, but it is fun and the costumes are gorgeous!!"
0,Cushy mat...while it lasts...,"Was using this for P90X, it was good cushioning and the only complaint in the first month was that I should have gotten a longer mat as my 6'1"" height was a bit much for some of the exercises. However, the severe problems with the mat came when the shoddy stitching burst and I was left with a busted mat after about 3 months."
0,Oh NO!!,"It starts out interesting ,but when it's supposed to be scary it's not,I got it because it says the makers of Final Destination,BUT the knock off scenes where cheap and got UNINTERESTING QUICK,not worth the watch."
0,Mathewson-Lite,"There is not enough baseball detail in what could have been an interesting book. Seib's efforts to set the career of BIG SIX in a broader context is laudable, but misses the point for a book this brief and this short. Some people devote their lives to the history of the world's greatest game. Seib is not one of them. The mechanics of his prose will not put you to sleep, but do not linger in the mind either. But the glaring error of this book is selling Christy short. Seib can bring himself to devote less than two pages to one of the greatest World Series performances in history, where Christy spun three shutouts. While some baseball books devolve into pitch-by-pitch tedium, more detail here is demanded.If there is a better Christy book out there I will consider reading it. Do not waste your time with this one."
0,Boring & Predictable,"Horrible Mr Clancy, dull, predictable, repetitive and just an awful poor read. A submarine that takes on five at a time and wins 'em all, all the time? ""I don't think so, Tim!"" It will be a long time before I pick up another tom clancy novel to read on a trip. I threw this one in the subway trash after enduring the first 2/3. Yuk!"
1,Old movies are the best,Saw this movie when I was a teenager and loved it. Now some 25 years later I wanted to see it again. Bought it and enjoyed it all over again. Old movies are the best!
0,Beware,"This adapter doesn't work on the newer HP digital cameras so be sure to check the model number before you purchase. Also, the adaptor comes in a package that is impossible to open without ruining. Conveniently, Ritz Camera does not accept returns if the packaging isn't intact. Shipping was also steep at 6.99. I would not purchase from this vendor again."
1,Stellar game,"This is one of the best Xbox 360 games by far. It is very violent, so, only get it for the maturer gamer, but, it is a ton of fun, controls beautifully, and the graphics are astounding."
1,Makes me happy everyday,"I got this on a recommendation from a friend who makes great coffee. I love this it makes coffee with some substance to it. Their is all of the yummy oils from the coffee and the residue in the bottom of my cup which I love, it makes coffee so much better. Not the sterilized coffee that you get from the pods."
1,"Worth every penny, and more!!!","I first read this book in my school library. After this first one I was hooked. I've read up to the seventh book and I now own books one and two. These are good enough that I can read them repetedly and still experiance all the emotions I felt the first time through.Not only, but Izark the main guy is a georgious babe! and you cant help loving him, even if he seems gruff sometimes. Noriko, the main character is from modern day Asia and was blasted into this new mystical world. FULL OF HUNKS at every turn. And just you wait til she tries to learn the language later on. One pannel alone had me cracking up for ten minutes straight! The storyline is so much fun to walk through. And the author throws some completely random thoughts in every now and then which just makes me laugh all the harder. This book is worth every penny, and more."
0,I know 6th graders who can construct a better story.,"This novel doesn't even comes close to any previous Sheldon work. It is trite, the plot is non-existent, the characters are cardboard at best and say the stupidest things, and the whole thing is a huge waste of time. I gave it one star because that's as low as the ranking goes. For work of this caliber Amazon needs a line of minus stars.The sad part is this novel was most likely only published to trade on the previous well-done work by this author, and that is the only reason i read it.You know, there is much validity to the cliche ""quit while you are ahead"" and it is really a shame that Sheldon 's editor didn't remind him of that."
0,not good for legs,"I have waxed for ~15 years. I tried the laser hair removal, and it wasn't permanent, so now I'm back to finding a solution. I thought I'd try this because it was inexpensive, and I couldn't find the old one. It takes FOREVER to do my legs, and I have to go over it 3 or 4 times to get one hair. Maybe because my hair is so fine now from all the previous removal efforts? In any case, I'm now in the market for a different epilator and am looking at the ""Braun SE7781 Silk-Epil Xpressive Epilator Body System, Rechargeable"" which seems to get really good reviews.I gave this product two stars instead of one because it does work well under the arms. It's a small enough area that I can tolerate going over it 3-4 times and all the hair is gone. Definitely better than shaving or waxing (no more akward elbow-on-the-door-frame waxing tug of war with the underarms!) But if you're looking for one epilator to do it all, keep looking!"
0,Well...,"I was kind of afraid to buy this after reading some of the comments. But it's not horrible, just unexceptional. There are about four good performances on the disc. The rest sound like they come from some community theater production. I don't hate this disc, but I'm going to try to resell it."
0,Great!,One of Dan Aykroyd's best movies. The man is quite talanted. I like him in all of his movies and this one is no exception. Wondered why it took do long to come out in DVD.
1,"So romantic, it makes you fall in love....",I was delighted with this book and found it difficult to put down. I fell in love with Katherine and John and despaired with them. This book made me thirst to know more about English royalty and the history of the era.
0,A Dog Year,"Jon Katz has a ""potty mouth""! He uses swear words that add nothing to the story. It only serves to offend his readers. I will never buy another book by this author. He's actually a pretty good author. Too bad he can't keep it clean."
1,Great system,"This is a great navigation system. I decided on Garmin after a lot of research on the Web and speaking with other people who have GSP navigators. So far it has been very consistent in giving me good directions and it is very easy to use straight out of the box.The only thing it does not offer is ""highway only"" or ""no highways"" options on the routing. Also, it did not come loaded with the most current map software but Garmin is sending me the newest software at no charge.You won't find a perfect GPS in this price range but this one was close enough for me and so far I am very happy with it."
0,Not as big as it seems,"The bag was very nice and well made, however, the inside is much smaller than I was expecting. I do pack a lot of things, I hate not being prepared. Once I put 4 size 3 diapers in the inside pocket, you could barely get to the main section of the inside. There was no way to put a recieving blanket, onesie, sleeper, diapers, bottle, and formula in there. I plan on returning it."
1,Must Read,This book was recommended to me by everyone I know. It's a must read for the bride and groom who want to really understand the Jewish wedding. Makes the experience all the more meaningful.
0,Kills your back if you're too tall,"This carrier puts all the baby's weight on your shoulders and upper back. I can stand it until the baby's about 10 pounds, but after that, it's just plain painful.The pain starts in my shoulders, where the straps start to dig in. Then it moves to my lower back, which is straining to stay straight with 10+ pounds of baby pulling my upper back forward. Then my stomach muscles start to ache too.The only time i ever use this carrier is at the grocery story, where the fact that it is pretty easy to get set up solo is a major benefit. For walks at home when i can take the time to get the it set up, or any time i can borrow another pair of hands, i use theERGOcarrier, which keeps the weight on my hips instead of contorting my spine."
0,Not What I Expected,"I was excited to get this book until going through 450+ pages, I realized it was more of a beginners book than serious data manipulation."
1,"Decent Park Tool, but I Don't like the Cap Tool","This tool works well to get the bottom bracket apart, but the plastic spindle remover does not provide enough surface to grab onto to remove stuck-on caps. Park Tool makes a metal tool for this also (BBT-10) that looks like a big wing nut. In hind sight I should have bought that as well. Most of the time those caps are stuck on there really tight. The BBT-10 would make it much easier to get the cap off. From personal experience, I highly recommend it in addition to this tool."
1,I WAS RAPTURED.,"Hello. On June 15th. I was raptured. I disappeared out of my clothes and went to heaven. But when I got there, an angel said, ""Hey, wait, you're not on the list."" Then I woke up on earth. But I still wasn't wearing any clothes. They arrested me for indecent public behavior, and I told them my story, but to my surprise they did not believe me. Now I stand in New York City on a cardboard box yelling the prophecy, IT IS COMING IT IS COMING THE RAPTURE IS COMING I HAVE BEEN RAPTURED BY GOD AND IT WAS GOOD! but no one believes me.Please believe me. Read this book it is important it will teach you about the rapture of the Christ and why it is good and will happen. Thank you.Sincerely,Michaelangelo. (My angel name.)"
0,stupid game,"personally, this game is one of the most horrible games i have ever played. It may be fun to skate around for a few minutes but gets very old VERY quick!!! not to mention the most annoying music i have ever heard! i must say, though, it will keep any child under the age of 10 busy for a long time. this game is totally lame! i can see why they would throw it in for free with the new xboxs. it doesnt even deserve a fraction of a star...im out...later fools..."
0,Disappointed,"I've been shaving electric since 1936!I have a light beard. My latest razors have been Norelcos and then almost ten years ago I bought a Braun 5520 and currently I use them alternately. I prefer the 5520 slightly over the Norelco because the cutters last much longer. I bought a Braun 8975 recently so I could leave it at my vacation house. It Seemed to have the same cutters as the series 7 w/o the questionable cleaning system.After 2 months I'm disappointed in the short usage time of the battery......I get 5 shaves only before I have to recharge and I've discharged it completely twice already.Also, it does not cut any closer than my 5520 which incidentally gives me about two weeks of shaving before I must recharge it. I'm sorry I got the 8975. It seems very cheaply constructed and a real disappointment. The case isn't very substantial either and it's very noisy."
0,Dull and Confusing,"The first fifteen minutes were incredibly boring. No, I wasn't expecting an action movie. The mixture of four time periods was confusing. I've got better things to do than try to keep all the story lines straight and still get the message. I doubted it would get any better, so I gave up. Two thumbs down."
1,speedminton more fun than badminton,"This game is fun for myself and my kids .....the birdie is very bouncy, which makes it easy to hit even if it hits the ground! Good exercise for all."
0,Great Looking Hammer - Poor Design,"Have had this hammer for about three or four weeks. Great hammer, nice looking, however after a couple of trips I noticed that the black 'button' near the end of the handle was protuding slightly. On a trip this week, the 'button' which turned out to be a plastic rod which goes through the handle, and which secures the handle onto the shaft fell out and disappeared when I was breaking some rocks.I now have a hammer that tries to come apart when I hit a rock - horrible design! I guess I now have to find a steel rod to replace the plastic one - something Valley should have done in their original design!I think I'll stick with Estwing for my next hammer purchase!"
0,Cheap Junk,"Be warned Cellular Factory intentionally put up the wrong pictures on this listing. This is the cheapo adapter with no activity lights. You might as well buy it elsewhere for half this price. Cheap, cheap, cheap. False Advertising."
1,Great Crit of Movies by Genre,"This is basically an updated and revised edition of ""Film Genre: Theory and Criticism"" published in 1977. As a system of filmmaking, genre has been one of the most important factors in making the cinema both an art and a highly successful form of popular entertainment.

0,NILE RULE! NILE RULE...,"Errr, NOT really, haa! I mean these guys are OK! I really agree with Cemetary E... & Infernal_RItual on their bashing reviews. I definitely think that nile (their name doesn't deserve to be capitolized!) are OverRateD! Come-on, folks, they're not that good! Gee, calm down here, will ya!

1,Very informative,I bought this book as a birthday present for my mom who is a big fan of birds. She loved the color photos and all of the information contained in this book is amazing! She is going to have a great time flipping through it and reading about all the different birds she can attract to her yard. I think it was a good purchase.
1,is this zappa's best album?,"Maybe so. It is also probably his best band. FZ has often said that music shouldn't get in the way of good lyrics. He has also practiced (though not explicitly said) the opposite. This album is the exception. The two combine in a way rarely found: Humour and some of the most sophisticated music you're ever likely to hear come together here. I have a real problem if I have to compare this album to ""we're only in it for the money"" or ""200 Motels"" or ""Live in New York"", or ""Hot Rats"". But it may just be the best. I dicovered FZ through this album when I was 15. I have never looked back since."
0,Is this an Author in Ruins?,"Was this a quick write for the big buck? This is not the Leon Uris of Exodus, Mila 18 and The Haj, among others. His characters are caricatures. They have no depth, they are unreal. The editing is horrible. I wish I had read the reviews before I bought the book. I would not have bought it, I do not advice others to buy it. Extraordinarily disappointing."
1,great buy,"I love these shoes. They are crazy comfortable and very stylish. Look great with jeans. Not great for skating because of the loose fit, but if your looking for comfort and style I definitely recommend."
0,Too messy,"It's perfect for caulking outdoors. Indoors, not so much. I'd rather stick with the manual gun for that. I like how I can hook it up with a regulator to regulate the flow, but the trigger almost seems like it's either an on or off position. When you let the trigger go, it doesn't stop the flow immediately. You have to wait for a little trickle to come out. Too messy for me. It sure can burn through a tube of caulk in less than 30 seconds if you turn up the regulator.I wouldn't recommend it to anyone really. There are better products out there."
1,An eye opener,If you have wondered why certain things are repeated in your family from generation to generation; this is a good read. There are many things that are a cycle in our life that can be broken and re-determined by us.
0,If I have the choice...,"I would have given the seller ""Bargain Buyers Software"" negative 5 stars.1. this is bootleg, do not buy from Bargain Buyers Software. No wonder he sold it for so cheap? $0.99??2. this game is not playable with win XP. I think the reason is because it is a bootleg.BAD seller!!"
1,Fun and useful,"Our cats love this. I purchased it to help keep our cats active, and it worked. Now the only problem is to find it... they've hidden it!"
0,Quality Control,"The price was right and the picture was good. However, I was forced to return two of these DVD players as the first arrived with a large dent in the casing. The replacement arrived with a larger dent in the casing, but on the opposite side. Both boxes were in perfect condition along with the internal packing material. This leads me to believe the item was boxed up and sent this way from the factory. The price is low but I guess the adage holds true that you get what you pay for. It's a shame as I'm sure a lot of work went into packing this many features into a unit and keeping the price as low as they have."
1,The Best Recipe Software Ever,"Home Cookin' is the best software I've ever used. It does its job in a remarkably user-friendly manner, has tremendous flexibility in formatting, and is fast-fast-fast! Highly recommended."
0,"I'd give negative stars, but that wasn't an option",I can't get it to install and I'm not new to computing. don't waste your money.
0,Breeding Dogs For Dummies,"This was the very worst ""For Dummies"" book I have ever purchased/read. I am planning on breeding my young Poodle and I have purchased 3 other books on the subject of dog breeding. This book did not go into anywhere near the details which the other books had. The author of this book seemed more into telling you why you should not breed, then giving you the important details of what you need to know if you are going to breed. Would not recommend this book to anyone!"
0,"Great movie, Terrible access","By far one of the greatest martial arts movies of all time, but having the only viewing option as ""streaming"" , rather than being able to download and watch without pixelation from streaming, has convinced me to NEVER buy a movie through amazon again."
0,A complete waste of time,"I assume anybody buying this title is because of Shannon Tweed. Let me tell you, there is only one love scene by Tweed. Therefore I give it one star just for the one love scene (not too bad though). The rest of the girls are nowhere as attractive as Tweed. The plot is ridiculous that is not worth mentioning. The sound quality of the DVD is terrible. You hardly can hear the dialog without turning up your center channel (If you want to hear the dialog at all). If you are looking for entertaining soft porn. Look elsewhere. Avoid this at all cost. One last note, this movie also known as ""Singapore Sling"" so don't be fooled."
1,Surprisingly good for historica fiction,"I picked up ""Gone to Texas"" for some light reading on the airplane. The book was better than I expected. There were a number of fairly emotional passages in the book and the list of about twenty actual historical events at the end (which were woven into the story)was appreciated."
0,GoFit Core Disk Review,"I received my disk and without the DVD, it looked used with spots that would not come off. I cleaned it but they still would not come off. It works as far as my rear end being sore and I may eventually see results on my love handles. I am sorry because of the condition of the disk I will not purchase anything from Amazon again.Marilyn Stevens"
1,Insightful,"Gives insights to survivors of a nervous breakdown. Would benefit anyone,close to a survivor and better understanding of what it is."
1,gripping and heart-wrenching,"i felt like i became tatiana - the story was so well-written and engrossing. i loved the historical detail almost as much as the story. i felt emotionally drained but so satisfied reading this. i recommend the first and second books 100%, but summer garden was very poorly done in my opinion. it will be hard to not read it after the first two though. they are so good you can't imagine not reading the last one. do yourself a favor and reread the first two instead."
0,not very fun,"Game is ok if you want to play against a computer; no two player games. In the game ""Speed"" it's hard to move the arrow to play the cards you want to play."
0,"No Way, No More LucasArts Garbage For Me","[....] Its bad, real bad. 3 ships?? No throttle control?? ""Rogue Squadron type game"" (meaning cheap graphics, slapdash programming)?? Yeah, I thought so. Starfighter is another piece of garbage with the words ""Star Wars"" slapped on it. The last decent space fighter game to come out that was Star Wars related was ""X-Wing Alliance"", and I have yet to see anything new that was even half as good as that game. I include the new Nintendo game in that list as well.I'm going to save my money and wait until a decent Star Wars game comes out for the PC, this ain't it."
0,Don't Buy,"After using my 2401 power washer for ONLY three minutes, oil and water started puking from the pump oil fill; the motor quit running. After contacting Porter Cable, I was given the address of two places that ""supposedly"" work on this machine. I took it to the first place on their list. After three weeks, I went to get the washer. Then I was informed that they put a new seal kit in the pump, but the motor wouldn't start; they ONLY work on the pump, not the Honda motor. After driving 60 miles to a place that Porter Cable told me works on Honda motors, I'm informed that in fact, they don't; that Honda makes it too hard to be a service center. When I looked up this unit and the warranty, nothing was said about having separate warranties on the pump and the motor. All in all, I would NEVER, EVER buy something like this again........what a pain."
0,1974 Monte Carlo's ---Not Available with manual transmission,"All 1973 thru 1977 Monte Carlo's were not available with manual transmissions,and therefore would not require a flywheel or clutch-disc or clutch release bearing,( throw-out-bearing ) or pilot bushing.They most certainly would not have the interior clutch pedal either ! I know all ofthis, after converting my own 1974 Monte Carlo into a 454 LS6, with an M22 Muncie4-speed with a Hurst Comp. Plus Shifter and a 5.13 Zoom rear end ratio.A very fast car, but too much of a ( lead sled ) to be a real threat for anyone witha nice 427 Vette or 55 Chevy big block. More or less --just a novelty to confuse allthe next generation running all the imports with turbo's and nitrous. Stan"
0,This stuff almost killed my cat!,"He came in from the back yard about 8 hours after application, panting, heart racing. I thought he was overheated and didn't put two and two together until the next day. The veterinarians staff said they have lost many, many cats to this product. I cannot believe it is still being manufactured and sold."
0,Fila Brazillia - Saucy Joints,"I'm all for remixes, remakes, and reconceptualizations. On their Saucy Joints EP, however, Fila Brazillia do none of that and instead have Djinji Brown deliver some mediocre raps over some of their classic tracks. Thus ""Little Dipper"" just becomes ""Dipper"" and ""But Momma"" becomes just ""Momma."" The rap adds nothing to the track -- more than anything, they detract from the originals. So just stick with the originals. Saucy Joints just leave a bad taste in your mouth."
1,Great toy!,"Everywhere I look, I see a Palm. I finally decided to see what the big deal was. I was not impressed with my Win CE machine (I like MS, just not in a handheld) so it took a while before I'd try this. I'm an immediate convert! I never knew there was so much you could do with a Palm and I'm VERY glad the IIIxe comes with 8 megs. I almost bought a IIIe, just because I'm a cheapskate- glad I didn't! I used 4 megs in the first week. Books, games, addresses, star charts, you name it, it's out there!Only gets 4 stars because I dropped it less than 2 feet and cracked the screen. Take my advice- get a STRONG case for it and/or buy the screen replacement warrenty from Palm. $100 to replace the screen, $30 (or so) for the warrenty."
1,Better than expected.,I was talking to a friend about Flamenco guitarists and he recommended this artist. I ordered a CD by him and was totally satisfied with the quality of work. I will buy more of his music.
0,Definitely NOT what I expect from Berenstain Bears!,"I can't believe I'm giving a Berenstain Bears book a 2-star review...our 4-yr-old loves them as much as I did as a kid, and so they're great for helping us work on a concept (lying, fighting, whining, etc) without lecturing all the time and having to resort to a hundred different ""discipline techniques"" to get a point across. We'll just refer to a story, and she remembers the lesson. Not so with this one! I bought it in a Scholastic book order, and it'll be donated to my daughter's classroom tomorrow! Moral of the story: whine and drag your feet long enough, and you win! NOT a lesson I want to teach my own kids. I agree with other reviewers who said it just seems ""off"" from the other Bear classics, and it's probably better than 2-stars for just readability factor, but for what I was looking for (a book with a lesson taught, what I've come to expect from BB), it fell way too short of the mark."
1,Iron Man,Hey I like it and that's all your going to get unless you have to put in more words which is rediculous!
0,A Disgrace to the good name of Paramount and Demille!,"I saw this version, the remake, first, then the original. Ever since I saw the 1938 original I haven't been able to sit through this one. Compared to the '38, this one has NO adventure whatsoever. Clair Bloom is terrible, trying to be something she ain't. The story isn't completely told, missing a few vital scenes that are found in the original 1938 swashbuckler starring Frederic March and Franciska Gaal. If you've seen this, or want to my advice: watch the original instead, the original is a six star epic!"
1,Emotional,Vikki Carr has one of the most beautiful voices. She brings something special to her latin music. Her style of clarity and emotion is truly moving!
1,Janis Joplin meets Aretha Franklin,"This is by far my favorite CD this year. I listen to it every time I'm in the car and then bring it into the house to listen to while I work out. The slower songs are endearing and the rest makes you proud to be a girl! I LOVE this CD. I bought it for LA Story because I liked it so much. However, when I've bought a CD because of one hit I am generally let down with the rest of the songs but not with this one. This is an AWESOME CD. Highly, HIGHLY recommended. Waiting for her to come in concert to the MN area - PLEASE BETH!"
1,Simply fascinating,"I have read several books before regarding NDEs and the subject is always truly astounding. Moody gives examples from many different people who have experienced NDEs. This book makes a believer out of me that there is life after life on earth. Moody doesn't try to sell his viewpoint - he simply presents the facts as they were presented to him. He doesn't try to sell the phenomena as brains deprived of oxygen; he doesn't try to sell any scientific reasons as to what really happens. He lets the peoples stories speak for themselves. If you know someone who is a non-believer in the hereafter (and may be dying), this book should make them less afraid of death."
0,fan of john edward show not book,"i'm a fan of john edward and i watch as often as possible. he gives so much of himself to help others heal. i could not finish this book. i went half way and put it in my ""get around to it"" pile. john's gift is one on one interaction."
1,Does the job well,Much better than the wrist omron I purchased a while ago. This one is even used at a one of my dr's offices. I measured my blood pressure before going to dr and then compared to dr's count. Only off by one or two numbers which nurse says is normal.
0,Not up to her usual standards,"This is one big disappointment. There are simply too many negatives to this video--don't waste your money! I was surprised to find that this was so poorly done, compared to the 3 other Saffell videos I own and use regularly.The production is so poorly done, half the time you can't hear what she's saying. The volume and quality of her voice vary with her moves, so at times it's muffled. The lighting is awful and the camera changes angles so frequently it's impossible to see what they're doing, nevermind follow it. It looks very amateurish.Usually Janis gives too much instruction and too many demo's before picking up the pace. Here it's the opposite---we go right into complicated moves with little instruction and even less practice. So frustrating it's no fun.Janis is capable of much, much better than this."
1,Fabulous Read,"Fell in love with the country of Ecuador this year and then fell harder when I read this book...fabulous story, well written and incredibly irresistible!"
0,CAN'T FIND A GOOD SLEEPING PILL? THAN BUY THIS MOVIE!,"Yes, I must admit that I was fooled by the ""One of the most notorious, most debated, most banned films of the 'video nasty' era."" line on this back of this movie case. I was lucky because I found this at a Best Buy for $10.99. It should be $2.99 for as bad as it is. I've been let down by these Italian Horror Films one too many times. If you want good, gore filled, Italian Horror stick with Lucio Fulci or Dario Argento. Once you get past the bad dubbing and acting they're berrible. Oh, by the way, unless you are fluent in Italian this second disk is almost worthless-there is no opportunity to even have English subtitles. The only thing good about the second disk is the nudity and strong sexual content and that looks alright in any language!"
0,Missing pages - beware amazon customers,We love Richard Scarry and bought this book for Christmas. i was always so disappointed that it was only 6 pages long -. I just realized today (1 day past the return date) that it is supposed to be 24 pages long and we have a defective book. ***IF YOU ORDER THIS FROM AMAZON BEWARE THAT IT MAY ALSO BE A DEFECTIVE AND SHORT BOOK!!****
1,Fun and Handy Little Device,Passable optics in a convenient and portable package. Great for inquisitive youngsters no matter what their age is. Inexpensive enough to buy two if one is lost or broken.
0,Didn't work for me,I found the snoogle to be bulky and not help me sleep better at all. I felt like I wasted money on this product. I ended up just putting a regular pillow between my legs and that helped a lot more than the snoogle did.
1,No Matter What - Buy this CD!,"If you are rediscovering 80's rock, this CD is a must. If you have been a Def Leppard fan, this is a great CD to throw in the car. This compilation will keep you rocking out for many miles..."
1,Fun album - not all tracks are appropriate for young children,"My daughter has been a big fan of Johnny Cash (loves his voice!) since infancy. I was delighted to see that he has a children's album. She really enjoys it, as do her parents. The only downside is that some of the songs' lyrics are not really appropriate for little kids. However, this album is more child-friendly than most."
1,awesome towel,I agree with everything positive that everyones said. its just great. i got the bunny one about a month and a half ago and just ordered a duck one. collie loves to twirl the ears on the bunny while he dries off. its plush big and fluffy. theres nothing bad to say.
0,Waste of Money,This machine is a complete waste of money. The sprayer worked correctly only once for me. I wish I had researched more before I bought it because I spent money on something that will end up in a garage sale.
1,1 year later.....zero problems.,"I've waitted a year to review this product......to see if I was truly happy with it. To date, we've had no problems.All screws are in place, still works fine and we've had no issues other than actually using it regularly.It provides a good workout if you use it and I'm happy with it. I took away one star because it can be noisy."
1,Rating for Remember the 70;s Video,"I enjoyed seeing these bands perform, even if some of them were not live. I would like to see more 70's music CD's like this one but I find them hard to find. I like to dance/exercise to it."
1,Amazing,"I have a cannon S100, and I have been taking up to 170 photos in medium quality (enough to print a 10x8"" high quality picture). You can be a day taking pictures without being worry about memory."
1,"so far, so good","My dog's breath has improved somewhat since I started spraying his teeth( I got the spray a week ago). There is no noticeable change in the tartar levels so far, though."
1,Staying power through solid composition,Copeland's music is still fresh after almost fifteen years. I recommend this album to anyone with a taste for the nearly frenetic but carefully composed pieces once heard in the CBS series The Equalizer.I think you won't be disappointed.
1,Almost Perfect,"I imported this Soundtrack and was pleasantly surprised by just how much was covered and a little disappointed by what wasn't.This 32 Track CD will let you relive your favorite moments from this wonderful Series, however there are three things that keep this CD from getting five stars:#1: The Yozuca Track ""Going My Way"" is the short ""TV Size"" version (1:37) instead of the full version (4:27)#2: If you plan to put this CD on your iPod or any other mp3 player from your computer, you better be able to read japanese because good luck finding the english names of these tracks#3: For some reason, the track where Hayate and Kosame are first introduced, the track for which I bought this CD in the first place, is sadly absent. There is one that sounds sort of like it, but it's just not the same.But most people can live with these minor blemishes on what is one of the greatest Anime Soundtracks available (if you can stomach the crazy importing costs)."
1,One of my favorites,I really enjoyed these CDs. I got a lot out of this series and am now listening to them for a 2nd time. One of my favorites.
0,Disappointed by bias,"I found this book somewhat useful, in that it has a run down of development milestones which is what I was after in reading it, but overall disappointing.The fact that Barker says it is fine to stop breastfeeding at 9 months if you want to, despite that fact that Australian, American and the World Health Organisation's standards all recommend breasfeeding until *at least* 12 months concerned me. While there are acceptable alternatives for those who cannot breastfeed for whatever reason, her 'expert' view that to stop at 9 months is 'fine' seems misleading.Additionally, although she presents various options for managing issues such as night waking, it is clear where her bias lies (controlled crying) and she does not present any of the advantages of other systems.Basically, this book presents itself as being balanced and giving you options, but in my opinion the 'balance' is very one sided.I will not be purchasing or recommending this book."
1,An ABSOLUTE Must Have!!!!,"Every song on this CD is wonderfully crafted and if you like the samples, you will LOVE the CD! The full CD is so much better than the samples. I was a bit skeptical of buying the CD by just the samples but let me tell you - WELL worth the money!!!"
1,Dir en grey!,It's a single but it's got some pretty cool live tracks on it. I don't think i've seen these tracks on any of the other releases i own so definitely worth scooping up if you're a fan. If not this is still one of the more accessible places to start in their catalog.
1,Solid chair,"Good, sturdily constructed chair was easy to assemble. Comfortable seat and mesh backrest make for hours of sitting pleasure. Armrests are a little plasticy and cheap but not a major drawback. Overall, quite pleased."
1,Al Rokers cookbook,"One of my pts wanted this book, said she was having a hard time finding it. I bought it for her and she was so excited Loves the book Thank you for having it available and rec'd in a short time"
0,Not worth much,"Quotes aren't very inspirational or original and some don't even seem very related to Teddy Bears. Also, most are from people I've never heard of, which takes something away from them. The pictures aren't generally related to the quotes, and the book isn't as nice and ""miniature"" as I was hoping. Overall, not my best purchase... That said, it was cheap."
1,Beautiful!,This is just beautiful music--very melodious and evocative. Yo-Yo Ma is a consummate musician. Wonderful compositions like Morricone's in his hands is a delight to the ears and emotions. I highly recommend this CD.
1,a captivating story,"I loved this movie! Being set in Savannah, Ga. it was great to be able to recognize many of the sites. Kevin Spacey was outstanding as usual. This is a ""must-see"" for any Spacey fan or those who love a good mystery--and it just happens to be a true story, making it all the more intriguing."
0,there are better books than this.,"Lots of girls at my school reads the gossip girl series.So, I decided to read the first book. Yet.. it was so menial compared to other books that I've read. I understand why it has other people my age who normally don't read for fun, reading it. That's a good thing. But it's like a tv show like the O.C. or something on paper. It has no lasting meaning behind it.The plot is basically :A bunch of rich people going to parties, being nasty to each, wearing expensive clothes and (what do you know..) gossiping.Mildly entertaining. But if I wanted that I could just as easily watch TV or see a movie, a bad movie.This is a good book for people who don't like to read as it isn't challenging in the least or if you just like this kind of story.But if you're looking for a book that you'll really enjoy and remember, this isn't it."
1,Wow.,"I can't say much about this cd that hasnt already been said below. I just had to put this review here because of how impressed I was with this album. I have never heard a live album better than this in performance and production. The songs may sometimes lose those intracicies in the guitar parts and vocal harmonies that the studio versions had... but what it gains is so much more than I ever could have imagined from this band. Fantastically intense and atmospheric... probably the best progressive power metal album I have ever heard. Some of you guys may beg to differ, but I'm standing firm on this."
1,Steelers NFL body pillow,"I was very pleased with the Steelers body pillow that I purchased from Amazon, I had been looking for this pillow for a couple years and was so pleased to find it. It came in plenty of time for Christmas and the price was reasonable. I would not hesitate to order from Amazon and this dealer again."
1,Great,This product is perfect for what it can do and for the price. This is why I gave it 5 stars.This is a great series and it just shows how some real black familes are.
1,His best and most revealing work,Stuart Wilde lays it all out. If you have not read any of his other work I suggest you do so BEFORE reading God's Gladiators. Everything Stuart has written is worth a read but God's Gladiators supasses anything he has done beofre. He pushes your limits as he pushed his own. I highly recommend any of his work.
1,Sound better than expected. Recommended if you are over 30.,"My 25 yr old son had a 500 watts MTX amp driving a 12 inch Solo Baric subwoofer in his Camero so I really do appreciate good bass. I managed to install this mini sub right behind the driver seat in my 2000 Corvette so I had zero loss of trunk space. The sub hits harder than expected but sounded slightly boomy and harsh at high volume compared to my son's system. I suspect the 75 watts amp is underpowered. Kenwood advertises this sub as 150 watts but that's peak or maximum power and not RMS power. At medium volumes (which most people over thirty listens to), it sounds great so this sub will compliment any system. In my opinion, if you need the trunk space and you are over 30, then you will like this sub. Be aware that the location of the sub must be close to you to be effective. I once located the sub in my trunk and the bass drops off significantly."
0,One good concept and a lot of BLA BLA,"Reader be advised that the author owns a consulting firm that applies Woody's proprietary model in making market forecasts and, needless to say, he's not giving out anything ...Interestingly enough, the author criticizes the use of quantitative models, but later attempts to measure the ""mood"" of the market to use it in a quantitative model ... ? One more comment: the average reader of business publications expects to find some logic in the style; this is not fiction, and using a ""keep the reader guessing what the author REALLY means"" is no business reading.Did you take English 101 like the rest of us?"
1,Awesome!!!,"My sweet husband purchased the Kindle 2 for me as a Mother's Day gift. I absolutely love it. I have been able to access the Kindle store anywhere I have been and if I finish a series book, I can just access the store and within minutes I have the next book.Another thing that may not mean much to others but having the privacy to read anything and not have others checking out a book you have in your hands, is great to me. I love the freedom of the Kindle. It fits in my purse and I can read it anywhere. I absolutely recommend it."
1,WHY only 4 stars ?,"OK,I will tell you. it is because, for me ,Edu singing some of his finest songs ""em Ingles"" is like putting catsup on a FILET<that's why! hahaha! I understand the reasons for this , believe me, but this is no rational to do such a ""HEINOUS THING"", seu Edu! Of course, there is enough GREAT stuff on this cd to warrant it's purchase, You may LIKE the English lyrics too! Anyway, the musical ""guidance"" of Hermeto Pascoal in conjuntion w/ Edu's strong compositional concept makes this a great jump off point to further explore the musics of EDU LOBO--- my suggestion ,FIND ""Cantinga de Longe"",This is ""the one"",but enjoy this just the same ! Sarava Edu Ok,here's your 5th star--hahaha!"
1,not bad...,"Every 'suspense thriller' that comes out these days has a huge obstacle to overcome: the obligitory comparison to 'SILENCE OF THE LAMBS', or 'SEVEN'. How can ANY movie of such type hope to compete with these shining achievements of genre filmmaking? The answer is , of course, that they can't. 'TAKING LIVES' however, is at least a solid thriller that held my interest throughout. Ethan Hawke playing against type was a nice change of pace, and the lovely Angelina Jolie is always a welcome addition to any production. She may be mailing in on this role, but the woman is a vision to behold. Bottom line: I was entertained. Check it out."
1,A delightful read to escape the holiday stress!,"I have read all of John Grisham's books and have enjoyed his writing, though I had grown tired of the ""lawyer theme."" A Painted House was a nice change; but this one brings out what I think is a rare talent -- writing humor. I laughed out loud through this whole book. My husband kept sticking his head in the room to say, ""I must ask Grisham to write more books like this!"" It was a delightful weekend read and one that restored my spirit and still has me chuckling as I think about all the predicaments Luther created for himself. It is funny and heartwarming and strikes close to the truth of many of the traditions we have all established. When things get too frantic this season, take a few minutes to pick up this book and laugh long and loud!"
1,great product and fast shipment,Iloved this camera. It is very very cool!!!Ilove the slide show and the paint.The camera was at my house when I expected. Great!! You can trust it
1,The voice of an angel(no doubt about it!),"Angela Bofill's debut album. This is still as wonderful, amazing and unforgettable as it was when originally released in 1978.A truly wonderful and timeless album which features ""Under The Moon And Over The Sky"" ""This Time I'll Be Sweeter "" and ""Summer Days"". If you are into good music you MUST have this album. Just one listen and you will know why Angela has an angel's voice!"
0,One Love ~ 8th World Wonder,"If you want music that puts you to sleep, this is the album for you! What a shame, the third runner-up in the American Idol 2 series has a debut album in which her highly synthesized voice sounds like a combination of Hillary Duff, Britney Spears and Monica. The problem is, the producers couldn't make up their minds which one she should imitate! All the songs sound alike-with no beginning and no end and Kimberley just drones on and on about l.o.v.e. I didn't even enjoy listening to her duet with the other AI finalist. Hopefully, her next album will showcase her true voice instead of masking it."
1,Millenium Soul,"Love in Stereo might be ideal for that ""put-on-a-hot-soul-track-and-she's-mine"" ploy, but Rahsaan Patterson is one artist to eschew the hot 'n' sweaty sexual soundtrack trivialization of soul, and give it back some of its original features. A closer listen and a look at the video ""Treat You Like a Queen"" reveal his interest in issues of human rights. His activities for the National Association of Abused Women and Children, as well as his non-profit organization ""Soul Survivors"" put his money where his music is, smack bang in the Harlem neighbourhood where he grew up. Musically Patterson's sound resembles the laid-back but intense atmosphere of '70s Stevie Wonder records with a tendency, especially in the second half of the album, to gear up to funk and swing. Remarkable also is the cover of The Blow Monkey's '80s hit ""Diggin' Your Scene"" on the Japanese edition. By the way Rahsaan celebrated his 27th birthday on January the 1st, 2000."
1,Fits great. Happy with it!,"This took a little over a week to receive, but worth the wait. After reading the other reviews, I wondered if it would fit our iron-board, which we've had for almost 20years. No worries though! It fit perfect, like a glove. It even had two riveted holes at the base to 'hook' onto 2 small pegs under the board (I didn't even know they were there). It's nicely padded, but still folds up easily. Very pleased with this purchase."
0,Eddie's worst movie!,"This movie was as funny as changing an old person's diaper! I love Eddie Murphy, but I didn't find this movie to be very funny. If you want to see Eddie Murphy at his best, see Delirious! This one stunk."
1,Angey Salad is well on their way to the top,"I first heard of Angry Salad when I saw them perform at a local college fest in Boston (their hometown), and they were great! I immediately bought the CD, and I've been playing it very frequently. There's not one bad tune on the entire CD. Keep it up guys!"
1,'Untergang' discussed,"Written in the era of the postmodernist attack on science, and one of the few books in English (?) that discusses Spengler's 'Decline of the West'. Noteworthy for that alone, if you're one of the few who's read at least some chapters of Spengler. I found the discussion of Mach's Principle in the context of 'holism' to be scientifically enlightening and useful. It's good to learn to distinguish the relativity principle from 'relativism'. Mach had no idea of the difference."
0,There has to be something wrong here . . .,30 dollars for a chair and 159.00 for shipping ????203 pounds ????I think the ad should be re written.The thing that is odd is that there are others out there in pretty much the same situation.
0,Colors not true to picture,"I didn't really like this robe. First of all, the color was very different than shown in the picture. After that, it seemed to run a bit large. I returned it."
1,This was my First KMM Book,I know that we as readers get a little caught up in what we are reading and can be down right judgemental ( read my Immortal Highlander review) I for one enjoyed this story and this is where I first encounter Adam Black. I have not turned back since I began reading KMM. I liked this story and enjoy the read that it gave me. Lisa was not the whimp that the other female had been. I lked her.
0,Not so great.,These are really hard to use. My son is three and a half and it seems like they are really hard to push together for him. Its much easier for him to use the traditional safety sissors.
0,Lasted a year and a half,"I saved my money up for this Philips mp3 player. When I got it I loved it. I got it in June 2005, it just recently stopped working in January 2007. It only worked for a year and a half. I was very disappointed with this mp3. I will never get this very mp3 again."
1,Scary Read,"When Madison Finn spends the night at her best friend Fiona Waters' house, she thinks that maybe it's haunted. Then when she has the chance to enter a spooky story contest she gets a great idea for her story. Not only that, she's working on the decorating team, and Ivy is being really bossy. Will Madison survive Ivy's bossiness and have a fun Halloween?"
0,Okay Product for for the price,I still have yet to figure out how to download the information from my unit to my computer. Hopefully someday I will be able to figure this out. But the counting part of it is fine!!
0,What is taking so long?,I will evaluate this item should it ever arrive.When I purchased it on Aug 4 the estimated delivery date was Aug 10. After it failed to arrive I went back to my account to discover the estimated date of delivery was now Aug 17. Today is Aug 14 so I still have to wait until next week for it to arrive and then for the weekend to try it out. Had I known I would have paid the additional cost to receive it in a timely mannerAmazon has never done this to me in any of my other purchases so why this item is taking forever to get here is beyond me. An explanation via e-mail would have been helpful
1,"Good for Some, Unnecessary for Most","There are several Rush compilations, and this is not the best but will work well for some. At sixteen cuts and just under eighty minutes, it has songs from every Rush album through 1987 except Caress of Steel. Virtually every Rush song heard on radio is here, and anyone wanting only those will be satisfied. However, Rush is a true album band; deep cuts are often as good as or better than singles, and albums usually work better as a whole. This collection is thus only for extreme casuals. Anyone who is even slightly more curious would be better off with Rush's half dozen or so best albums. There is also no reason for completists to get this; it has nothing new. All this points to the fact that The Spirit was a record company marketing ploy to coincide with Rush's thirtieth anniversary, which is all that need be said."
1,Healthy for Hair and Environment,"I first received this shampoo as part of a gift. With all the chemicals we are exposing ourselves and the environment to, it was nice to find a shampoo that leaves everyone healthier. It has a great smell and leaves my hair shiny and clean. It does suds up but not as fluffy as other shampoos and some people may expect lots of suds. Since my only concern is clean hair without chemicals it didn't bother me. I highly recommend this product and feel safe using it on my family."
1,"Loved the product, disappointed in the way it was packaged and shipped.","I love the product, however I was not impressed with the way the product was packaged and shipped. There was no padding in the box and the cans knocked together, denting one. The box it was shipped in was very flimsy, not strong enough for the product shipped."
0,HORRIBLE,"if youre getting this movie for your kid, or any kid, save them the misery. i remember seeing this movie the day it came out, and it was so awful i fell asleep, along with about 5 other kids in the theater. it was by far the WORST movie i have ever seen in my entire life, even worse than that planet of the apes movie. and trust me, i have seen almost every movie that comes out. spare your kids the pain and spare yourself some money. DONT get this movie for them."
1,Enjoyable...,"Touching on his life experiences with his dog, Grogan tells a heart-warming and heart-wrenching story. Well told, the story covers the life of Marley from the time he was weaned to the time he died. I smiled, I read parts to my wife, and I cried at the end. What more do you want in a book? A good book to read and share with friends."
0,Disappointing,"I have spent the last three days trying to program this phone and it just gets more and more exasperating. There are 30 buttons on a 4 1/2 by 4 1/2 inch area and if you touch the wrong button, it is either erasing the information just entered, changing the settings, or recording phone conversations or ambiant noise. The read out is hard to see and it has only recorded one caller ID and now that functon has stopped. My other phone with caller ID is still recording the information so I know there is nothing wrong with my phone service. Yesterday it started blocking all outgoing calls altho I can still get incoming calls, I don't have a clue what is going on with this phone. In the past 10 years I have purchased well over 500 items from Amazon and this is the first time I have ever had any kind of problem. I know there are good reviews with this product but the one I have is a real DUD."
1,Well done,I really have no major complaints; it's a good guide and finding it free for download was a total score. It's a reference that would be worth paying for. Easy to read as the author clearly explains the history and symbolism of the different objects.
0,Junk Data Cable,"Don't buy this. It doesn't transfer anything. The CD is worthless. It should be rated Zero, but you can't go that low."
1,Too Funky!!!!!,"Words really can't describe ""Uncle Jam Wants You"". From the instrument to the vocal arrangement, you can't help but get your groove on once the music starts to play."
0,Disappointing,"After the incredibly imaginative seasons one and two, the third season is a real letdown. A few elements, like the Marshall's new home, work well, but there's just no ""meat"" to the series, which loses all logic in this season. Prime example: Holly, trapped in a frozen part of the Land of the Lost, complains repeatedly about how cold she is, but she never even rolls down her sleeves! I also disliked the sudden frequency of visitors to the Land in Season 3.It's a shame that the series underwent such radical changes; it would have been much more interesting to see the series develop on its original trajectory."
1,top-flite quality/competitively priced,"I've bought PIAA products for three vehicles now; their wiper blades for my Dodge Magnum maintained what has been a high opinion of their craftsmanship. A figurative and literal snap to install, their aerodynamic and work very well. PIAA also provides a small container of a silicone-like sealer to enhance the wiper's water repellent properties. I can say this is one of the rare occasions where a manufacturer backs up its claim.-M.D.Las Vegas, NV"
1,Just what I needed!,"The book was in great condition and was just what I needed for my class. Sorry this review is long overdue. Better late than never, though. Thank-you!"
1,Old Pentax lenses can be used with this camera,"I made the decision a few months ago that the time was right to buy a digital SLR. I considered a number of models. What sold me on this one was that I am able to use my very old, but very good, lenses. [...]I had 4 Pentax ME Super bodies from the 1980's. My lenses also date from that time.The manual was not very helpful in figuring this out. It does require a setting change and one can shoot in only manual focus mode with aperture priority. It's very much like shooting with the old ME's but with a 6.3 megapixel digital image as the result.From the menu, go to ""Custom Setting,"" scroll down to ""Using aperture ring,"" set to ""Permitted."""
1,AVENGERS!!!!,What can I say. The best deal yet to date for me! I got this when it went on discount in the beginning. Many different formats for different applications and many extras!
0,o'reilly looks out for your cash,"Do not buy this book!I have now 'looked out for you' more than this book ever will! The book is badly written, it is in desperate need of grammer...and dont get me started on the content! I always knew that O'reilly was a hard lined radical conservative, but this book borders on the ridiculous!"
1,Burnout 3: Takedown,You are not going to get a better racing game for under 20 dollars out there. This game is great and the crash mode will keep you coming back to it months and months after you've completed the story mode. buy it
0,Not very good,I received this back in October and I can almost never use it now. I keep getting errors on it and they don't go away even after taking the batteries out. Not worth the money.
0,There's no Secret here,"As I read The Secret, I couldn't believe that the professional who recommended it to me embraces the nonsense this book spews out. Turns out, she doesn't - I ordered the wrong book. I read the first four or five chapters, and was stunned that anyone could seriously entertain most of what the authors wrote. They do touch on some long-held beliefs shared by people throughout the ages, but they have an ability to turn such nuggets of truth into a life view that embraces the pursuit of wealth and fame. And you can have it, too - just follow the law of attraction! After reading the biographies of the various contributors, it is obvious that the book is a painfully thin-veiled advertisement for the workshops, books, and programs they are hawking. I'm very surprised well-known, otherwise fairly wise people didn't see that coming from the start."
0,Forgettable,"This book was a waste of my time. I have read Ms. Delinsky's books in the past and have found them ok. However, this book was boring. There are two different stories and I would be unable to recall anything about either. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME."
0,this is a dog!!,"I, like many others, have struggled with getting the Linksys WRE54G to work with my set up and despite following the detailed instructions available on various websites, I still cannot get it to work in my all-Linksys network. This is a very poor product from a normally competent company and I would advise anyone (even if you are technically competent) to avoid it."
0,Error in price of this itemj,The price of this should be between 3 and 4 dollars. I think there's an error here.Thanks.
0,Jarmusch continues to diminish his legend,"If you thought ""Ghost Dog"" was as bad as it could get, you were mistaken. This ""film"" would get a failing grade if submitted by an 18 year old at NYU film school. Everyone involved in making this boring, shoddily acted and directed travesty needs to be slapped. Perhaps a few critics who breathe a more rarifed air, or have evolved beyond requiring the burdens of plot, quality of acting, script, or basic direction, will find this celluloid atrocity entertaining. They should be slapped too. And slapped again.The stink of this film will linger long after you flush it from your DVD player. Even Bill Murray could not save it, but I could never find it within my heart to slap Bill.Jarmusch can only redeem himself now by perhaps saving a busload of children, and dying in the process.Perhaps."
0,doesnt really work,"I tried this for 4 months with no results so stopped using it for a month. I then got approved for HRT and developed breasts within 3 weeks. So if you are wanting to transition, do it the right way. Most doctors have a payment price, and truth be told, the most expensive thing is electrolysis aside from bottom surgery. What do you expect from a product that classifies ""crossdressing, transgender, and transvestite men"" all the same thing when clearly they are not."
0,Footlocker- You need a foot to get in it,"Bought this GI Joe footlocker for my 5 year old grandson;;;;what a mistake.....It would be nice because it holds small items for Joe and has enough room for two Joes; however, it takes an act of God to get into.....don't waste your money, like I did. It is very frustrating to him to have to ask everytime he needs something out of it and even more frustrating for me! The only toy I have purchased in a long time that I wish I had done without......"
0,Yuck.,"I always preview albums before I decide to buy..well, I only heard a few tracks before I was screaming 'enough'!! I can't stand his voice and I was getting nauseous during previewing. I saw him on the show, he sounded okay there..what happened?? If I had this CD, I would be using it as a coaster. Thank god I didn't buy it. Don't waste your money, buy Kelly Clarkson's instead."
0,eeckk,"this movie was ecky. it was all about some muslim African dictator and the abuses of his people. and of course there had to be a rebellious faction that was trying to over throw him. this had nothing to do with Romancing the Stone with the exception of having the same 3 characters. and perhaps seeing this back in the 80s when it came out it might have a hint of something new . . . after 9/11 and Iraq and Afghanistan and Libya and Egypt and Yemen and Iran and Syria and Lebananon and Kuwait. . . I am not interested in this movie, its subject or its setting."
0,Not worth seeing,This is the worst Micheal Douglas Movie I saw so far. It is about a dysfunctional Famliy. it has little comedy in it un like others that have dysfunctional families. it is downright boring.
0,High hopes dashed,"I really had high hopes for this series and similar to other readers, bought 3 novels at one go. Now I have a hard time just trying to finish Jacob. The premise is interesting as you don't find a lot of writers who are sympathetic to Demons. But I found it hard to reconcile that Jacob, the Enforcer, who has had centuries to hone his skills, had to rely on Isabella to save him not once but a few times. I don't like stories where skills appear without having been earned. For more than half the book, the story barely, moves with all the characters being angsty about what's going on in their culture. The sex descriptions are good (although he can't seem to get his fingers untangled from her hair!). I'll try Gideon (who really reminds you of Gregori from Christine Feehan's series) and see if I like it any better."
0,Useless...,High priced for a simple task to do...the game adapter from linksys works better and more cheaper than this.
0,Why sequels shouldn't be made.,"This movie is a perfect example of why sequels shouldn't be made.Nearly no story, laughably lame and predictable love story between people with no onscreen chemistry together. If only there had been maybe 20 more Mr Smiths.... it would have been blatantly farcical. I'd compare having to sit through this movie to having to sit through Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, but this experience might have been worse. The only way I'll watch the 3rd in this series is if it's the Matrix Reformatted."
0,Good for novices to programming,I was given this book as an introduction to Java having come from a PowerBuilder background. For that purpose it's rubbish. I speed read the first 6 chapters without learning more than a paragraph of useful information. For novices to computing I can see the need for a book like this but for anyone else steer clear! The guys that reckon it's too difficult should look at changing degree courses ASAP.
1,You need a 6 star option,"These books are awesome!!!!!! Totally a great fantasy series for kids and adults of all ages. My grandpa read them and really liked them. They're definitely worth 6 stars, that is, if you had a 6 star option..."
0,Casteneda Translated By A New Age Mystic,"This book was written as a ""doing"", not as a ""not-doing"". If you want to add to your ""inventory"", read this book."
0,Skip this shower radio,"I got this shower radio for Christmas and was excited. Also, the radio is only splash proof and can only withstand a small amount of steam. Because of this I didn't feel comfortable hanging it directly under the shower head by the rope, so I used the suction cups and placed it at the far end of the shower. But, I was constantly afraid that the suction cups would fail and the radio would fall. I used it exactly TWICE (total time was about 30 minutes) when the volume (on/off) button broke. Thankfully I still had the packaging but I had to pull it out of the trash can to return this thing. Think I'm going to try to find a different shower radio."
0,Use a Trader Joe's Bag,"A reusable Trader Joe's bag costs $1, and works great. Cut a 1.5"" diameter hole in the bottom. Let your tomato plant grow to about 18-24"" long. Put a bread bag over the plant and feed through the hole. Leave as much of the plant (at least 1/2) *inside* the bag as possible. By burying the trunk and branches, you will get good roots and strong plant. Put a coffee filter around the base of the plant to keep the soil in the bag. For soil, use equal parts organic compost, peat moss, and vermiculite."
1,Love It!,I absolutely loved this baby book! It is so fun and different from all of the other books that I looked at.
1,Fun history lesson!,"This is one easy way to introduce, reinforce, or just enjoy, American history through music! Starts at the Revolutionary War period, and goes through the years, across the continent. Interspersed with historical documents that listeners will eventually memorize. These are songs and events every American citizen should know!! Fun for children AND adults, great for singing along in the car on road trips!!"
0,Low-end fax machine,"Bought this fax couple of months ago online.Already used 3 rolls of film though I don't receive many faxes. Film is actually very similar to carbon paper and print quality is poor too.When I fax multiple pages, keep jamming.Other Panasonic fax I used over 7years was really good and that's why I bought this one to my worst disappointment."
1,"Fantastic album, with one of the best pop songs ever!","Juliana Hatfield really puts together a solid album with ""Bed."" Unfortunately, the album registered only on the indie scene. It has one of the best pop songs ever written, ""Backseat."" The album has a more ROCK feel to it, but she doesn't loose that quirky sense of pop she has. And her voice...enough said. I'm looking forward to what she has in store for the future."
1,Very good product.,I recently bought this docking speaker for my IPOD Touch and it has performed well. Gives very good sound quality. It is easy to use and worth the price paid.
1,Most informative and interesting I have read on genealogy .,I have always loved this book and wordered if the author wrote any other books.
1,!! Agree !!,"The adjacent review (with the 4.0 scale) is on-the-money!(even if he doesn't know the name of track #3). If you've NEVER heard the Old 97s previously you can buy this disc blind and be assured that after 3 plays through you will be well beyond hooked.I first saw ""Fight Songs"" on the rack at a music store while looking for something 'different'....and decided, then, naively, that a collection of college fight songs was not for me!!!........but I asked the clerk what the cool music was that they were, at the time, playing throughout the store. It was FS: so I tend not to be as critical about that last release as their older fans.........but I am seriously addicted.""Buick City Complex"" is the strong one here....talk about a new take on Joel's ""Allentown"" or Bruce's ""My Hometown""!!!!Guys, also note: Chick dig this stuff/this band."
0,Cartirdge leaks,"The cartridge leaks and doesn't give me clean copies. It leaves a band of ink spots on both sides of the page. The low toner light is back on after only a few weeks of use when cartridges in the past lasted at least a year. It is not only a mess, but a terrible inconvenience. I have no backup at this point and haven't had time to seek a solution."
0,"Great Title, Disappointing book","Being someone who devours anything written regarding Haiti, I was excited to read ""Bones Become Flowers"", but was soon skipping entire passages as the author became mired in description that did nothing to further the story. Also there are times when an author can believably write from the other gender's perspective and get it right, unfortunately this was not the case here. It was pretty obvious that the author was a male, not in tune with what a 30+ female thinks, feels, admires etc.The most disappointing thing was the ending. In all honesty, ""Bones Become Flowers"" was a waste of money."
1,Awesome CD,"I think this is one of the best CDs I have heard in a long time. I feel like every song has a special message to send to the listner!!! I especially relate to the song ""I Found You"". I think it describes how I feel about the man that I love with all my heart!!! I recommend this CD to everyone I come into contact with that enjoys listening to some AWESOME music that will feel your heart with love and joy!!"
1,The Three Stooges: The Movie,"I purchased this movie from Amazon.com for my grandsons aged 5&7. As we all know that ""The Three Stooges: The Movie"", is a guy movie. They absoutely loved it. They watch it every day. One of the best purchases I have ever made."
1,Anything But Sour,"A WONDERFUL lost, (at least to me) Christmas movie that will now be firmly established on my list of must see Holiday films.I had not seen this film before and did not know it was a Christmas film (probably because of the title) but it is a warm and hilarious Bob Hope romp and a veritable who's who of great character actors including Lloyd Nolan, Fred Clark, Sid Melton, Jay C. Flippen, Jane Darwell (the Feed The Bird's Lady from Mary Poppins), Tor Johnson (the hulking giant from Plan 9 From Outer Space) and even dear old Fred Mertz or William Frawley who helps introduce the old holiday standard ""Silver Bells"". And that's just the tip of the iceberg!The writing is great. The direction top notch and the laughs just keep on coming. I suggest you put ""The Lemon Drop Kid"" right at the top of your holiday film list. And why wait until Christmas? Put it in your cue now and celebrate Christmas at the height of this blistering summer!"
1,another great cornell album,"In typical chris cornell fashion, this album rocks! i never liked ratm, but i love this album. if you like it, you should also try Down On the Upside by Soundgarden, his former band."
0,Not engaging or useful,"I slogged through this book several years ago and didn't find it particularly engaging or useful.By the way, I think my copy is a 50th Anniversary edition and I have NEVER seen so many typos in a book in my entire life. Even the trashy sci/fi-fantasy novels I used to read were better edited than this."
0,Negative One Star,"I knew within the first 90 seconds (near record) that this made for TV film was going to be a ff (fast forward) genre movie. The give-away - you ask? A script that is 90% pointless fake military jargon e.g. ""clear"" and lots and lots of swearing. It's obvious that the script writers, actors and director have a psychological issue with how they've spent their lives in Hollywood boutiques and are overcompensating by creating toughness the easiest way they know how - let's talk tough. Besides the totally, totally unbelievable tough guy/woman acting was the single day rental fee for a helicopter and some industrial warehouse basement to provide the obligatory concrete passages and steam piping. The story was nothing more creative than the time worn plot of the military hiding an alien or devil or whatever. Finally, the prosthetic makeup infected skin and gunshots were so juvenile dumb - yawn."
0,It does not whistle,"I have been using this product over one year. 90% of the time, it does not whistle. I tried to secure the whistling top every time I used it, but it did not still help. When I was watching TV or being busy with another activity and try to heat up water for just a cup of tea or coffee, this is really bad news. I almost overheated this kettle so many times.Over all design is very good. Sleek modern style, nice color, steady handle, and secure top cap. Though I still have to give up this kettle as fire safety goes over those nice feature."
1,"Great cable, not a game!","When I clicked to rate this product, Amazon asked how much fun is this game and how do I rate this game.... HUH?!?This cable works great, it allowed me to connect my Wii into one of the HD inputs on my flat-screen. Believe it or not, it made a big difference in the picture quality during play.If you want to go HD with your Wii, this is a great bargain."
0,pretentious crap...look no further!,"If you want to waste your time and money , you have hit the motherlode with this aural torture. Do your self a favor and RUN , don't walk away from this sonic drivel."
1,"A bit large, but lots of pockets","It's a bit thick overall, but it has a ton of pockets. For some of my gear, the pockets are a bit tight, but perhaps I'm asking too much. I want a thin case with thick storage. I need something bigger on the inside than it is on the outside like a TARDIS, but I suspect I'm unlikely to find that in the real world. But, it's pretty thin, holds lots of stuff and provides good protection for my laptop. I suspect that's all I could ask for."
1,Feet Blisters,"I was looking for a product to protect blisters on my feet. I play flag football every week and needed something to protect my feet from blistering up each week. Unfortunately this product just falls off the skin when I played. I'm sure the product works fine for walking or something less strenuous, but for active sports and for feet blisters it will end up coming off. Turns out that using simple sports tape was my best protection cause i can cover a large area on my foot and it will not move."
0,Rip off,"This is not about the book but about Amazon. I got a mail telling me it is a free download at 0.00 $, but then Amazon tries to pull 2.30 $ for this 'free' classic. Seems they need every cent now to survive the iPad threat."
1,Bee Gees CD for my husband,"He loves the CD but it took a lot longer to receive it than I thought it would. Product was just fine, though."
0,Left depressed,"Watch this series if you want to be left depressed. Rated 5 star, no way. Loved Tess and hated everyone else except Tess's milkmaid friends."
1,MASTERPIECE,"If I had to buy a whole new sound system to hear this disc, I would. In fact, I did have to.See Pics of the stuff I bought, to listen to this disc here> http://community.webshots.com/album/547116390cbvosNCurrent favorites are ""Starry Night"" and ""7 String""ALL ARE GREAT though."
0,Babylon 5 - The lost Tales,"Could try to be funny and say ""should stay lost"", but that does not do justice to how bad this was. There are NO special effects. The story is boring. I watched this on a plane....the airport was less dull. Save your money."
0,Will Smith versus Act Up.,"Don't waste time with this movie. Lucky I didn't pay for it. The Omega Man was much better. This one was outright stupid. Will Smith can't act, and the bald sissys terrorizing him reminds you of an Act Up revolt. Richard Matheson's plot was drowned by the special effects."
1,If there are morale problems - greta read,"a no nonsense approach to get everyone back in the boat and the boat steered towards Christ, I consider Biblical - and thus sound and worth the cost for the Senior Pastors, Elders, and even Deacons as well as small group leaders and ""alpha's"". Get on board with this book. Writing style not my cup of tea, but a must for the library, there will likely be a time when needed."
1,GREAT!,"THIS 1986 FOLLOW OP TO ""PRIVATE DANCER"" IS NOT QUITE AS CATCHY BUT STILL A GREAT COLLECTION OF POP AND ROCK SONGS. THE STAND OUT TRACK ARE HER #2 HIT ""TYPICAL MALE"" TOP 20 SIZZLER ""WHAT YOU GET IS WHAT YOU SEE"" AND THE TOP 40 BALLAD ""TWO PEOPLE"", ALSO OF NOTE IS ""BACK WHERE YOU STARTED"" WHICH SHE WON A GRAMMY FOR BEST ROCK VOCAL PERFORMANCE, FEMALE, WAS PRODUCED BY ROCKER BRYAN ADAMS. ALL IN ALL JUST GREAT!!!"
1,The Best,"This is the best how to book for helping an autistic child with everyday life skills. Great format, easy to read and understand. The author has lived this and it shows in the writing and attention to details that are sometimes missed or forgotten when teaching an autistic child. A must read for those ""blessed"" with a child with autism."
1,good movie,"Really good movie,and came alot faster than i thought it would.I think i am going to buy most of my dvd's off amazon now because of the price,its definately worth the wait! Thanks!!"
1,The First Three...,"What more can a King fan ask for? This is a brilliant 3 novel edition of King's first 3 published books. I'm sure you don't need my review on the books, since by now you know all of them very well. This Edition has no flaws, unlike mentioned in earlier reviews, so I'm going to guess they fixed that. If you really are looking to expand your Stephen King hardback collection; this is the book to do it with."
0,Quality Is Doubtable,A few years ago I bought a full room of JBL speakers from center to subwoofer. All worked perfectly for few years(I am not the daily users of the system but once a week at most) until one day I heard disturbing noise from the subwoofer even before I turned on the receiver. I readjusted the receiver and the subwoofer as well as replaced the connection cable but all did not help. Now I have to find a different one for replacement. This time I will not do with JBL.
1,SATA II -- Wow!,"This was my first SATA II drive. I mounted it to a SATA I mobo, using a pci card adapter so that the drive could still function at SATA II speed. It worked beautifully and mounted easily. Then I decided to get a new mobo that handled SATA II (and some other stuff). I'm now running 3 of these hard drives, in addition to Seagate's smaller 320GB SATA II as my C: drive. This is with a P4 Prescott 3.6Ghz. The difference in speed is almost like the difference between cable and dialup."
1,Excellent Book in excellent condition,Book arrived promptly and in excellent condition. The book is very well written with plenty of illustrations to explain the relevant concepts. I would definitely recommend this for Electrical Engineers who want to study Electromagnetics.
0,You get what you pay for.,"One of the cheapest ratcheting screwdrivers and not worth much more that the $4.00 it cost. It has a weak, cheap ratcheting mechanism and adjusting collar. Best for light duty work."
1,Must see!,This is a must see to better your awareness about the food you are putting in your body. It is a eye opening fact about our food revolution. It has changed my view on food---I am going organic for sure!!!
0,"Have to return it due to echo, unfortunately.","For the most part I've liked this phone for the 6 weeks we've had it. Initially calls were very clear and it has a good range away from the house. But after a few weeks I would occasionally have a call with a very noticeable echo or reverb sound, and unfortunately now it's happening on most calls. It's really distracting and just not tolerable for us, so the phone is going back. Should also mention that one day the caller ID on my handset just wasn't working; it would say ""incoming call"" but never display the caller ID, though the other handsets were. Next day it worked fine. Still waiting to hear from the seller, but if they don't honor it then I assume (hope!) Amazon will."
0,Bad,"The bottom part keep twisting and coming off all the time. Can't use straight for five minutes.Bad product. Again, another waste of money."
0,very disappointing. Look else where,"We were in the Caribbean this last November and heard wonderful steel drum and Caribbean style Christmas music throughout our stay there. When we returned, I thought it would be fun to have some Christmas music with a Caribbean or steel drum style as we heard during our stay. After reading the wonderful reviews, I ordered this CD.I am very disappointed in the CD. I find the vocals to be annoying and irritating and not at all the fun upbeat melodic music we heard while in the Caribbean. The music was repetitious and without any sort of musical creativity and sounding very amateur. I'd recommend looking elsewhere. This CD was a major waste of money."
0,terrible,"Aimless wandering plot, indiscernible purpose to the story. It has nice graphics, but that's about it. Vastly inferior to the original."
1,In my top 10 piano CDs of all time.,"I cannot say enough, how much I love this guys playing and writing. My wife and I had ""I Do"" played at our wedding, that's how much I love this song on ""To the Summit"". I wish I lived closer, to catch him in concert when he is playing. I know that I want to see him if he ever gets close to Wisconsin again. I love every song on this CD. It takes you somewhere, in your heart and soul. Jon is truly a gift to this musical genre."
0,An Unanswered Question,"The movie is based on one question: ""What if the saga of Jesus happened today?"". The problem is, the question is never answered. What this film is, is simply a modern day re-telling of the saga of Jesus. It is too literal an interpretation. The 12 desciples are still all men. They are all named the same as the original 12. ""Jesse"" (why not Joshua???), as the savior is called, feeds the hungry with bread instead of something modern like pizza. Jesse is executed on the cross instead of by lethal injection or some other modern method.Although most of the story was a bit judgmental and anti-semitic in some aspects, the special effects were good and the crusifixion scene was intense and very dramatic."
0,Bella Dancerella is a Dissapointment,"I bought this for my 5 year old daughter because the commercials made it to be better than it actually is. For $30.00(plus this item did not have free shipping) you get a plastic mat that has two sides, a plastic barre, and an instructional video, and ballet slippers that barely fit. The video uses song and a kind of techno sounding beat to try to teach the steps. My daugter was a bit confused when she used this. It was like a game of twister for her. She wasn't sure where to put her feet and at times and needed encouragement from me to help her place her feet. It says you can combine the foot moves to make a dance. If my daughter cannot figure out where to put her feet how is she going to do that? The money would have been better spent on real ballet lessons with a real instructor. She learns more from an episode of Teletubbies."
0,Too much drag.,"I knew I was taking a gamble since the reviews were inconsistent. While I'm sure they would have eliminated the possibility of getting a flat again, they slowed my bike down so much it was like peddling through sand. On top of that they had a ""lumpy"" out of round feel to them. I was also afraid the beads on my tires were going to slip off the rim. They'll probably work in a utilitarian application like a hot-dog cart or wheel barrow but they're useless for a bicycle unless you want an extra workout."
1,"DONT SLEEP, Incredible",do not sleep on this album..takes hip hop back to its roots. i know blue black personally and everything he says means something..get this and 48 months now. incredible..jazz hip hop feel that makes you wanna groove. get it now
1,Unrelenting suspence.,"A totally different kind of war film, told close up, illustrating the conflict these men faced every day in Iraq. The directors Oscar was well deserved. Jeremy Renner was superb as was the rest of the cast. A truly great film."
1,Petticoat Junction,Excellent show and great DVD. It's a must have if you love great old comedy classics.
0,Absolutely horrendous!,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I saw it to check out the scenery instead of the story, but could barely sit through it. The plot is terrible and after Richard is sent away from the rest as punishment until he can get rid of the newcomers - it only gets worse and confusing. The whole video game scene was ridiculous - what was up with that! If it is not too late, do NOT see this movie, it will only waste your time!"
1,A Fascinating Story,"I read this book some years after I had seen June Cross' documentary about her parents. The book is more a follow-up to the story, rather than a retelling or a sequel, but it does give you the entire story covered in the documentary. Besides providing us with some very interesting insights into the lives of the celebrities in her life, both well-known and obscure, Ms. Cross tells a fascinating story of identity and family relationships, with no easy answers, and I'd call it a very good read. I do hope Ms. Cross has in reality come to terms with the circumstances of her life as well as this book indicates that she has."
1,"Very good, but a little fast for beginners.","It's a good video, in my opinion. They do tell you what muscles they work, they do tell you what techniques to use when a move is hard, and they do have easy to read drawings to show exactly HOW to move your hips.It's a perfect video to work out to, especially for someone with an old hip injury like myself who's looking to tone and restore muscle use to a weak hip, and is afraid of putting too much stress on it through traditional exercise.Unfortunately, the video moves fast for a beginner, and I had to play it a second time through to get it just right. But only a second time! It's not THAT hard to catch up to, once you figure out what you're doing.Bonus: My 3-year-old son tries to bellydance with me.Definitely a good buy!"
0,cheap garbage,"I bought it 6 weeks ago. It started RUSTING! No, I'm not kidding, I had to throw it away!"
0,"Disappointed, 2","I, too, found the book tedious. The characters are largely caricatures and the situations contrived. I didn't care about any of the prinicpals because none of them seemed like real people me. The book seemed more like an exercise in multicultural writing--stuff in as many ethnic groups and religions as possible--than a well-thought-out novel. I've nothing against multiculturalism, but I'll stick to Bharati Mukherjee, Rohinton Mistry and Maxine Hong Kingston in the future."
0,"Not stable, a lot of bugs, it freezes when recording voice over 20 mins","I definitely don't recommend this product. When I record voice, it seems that there is a limit of 20 mins. If you inadvertedly record more than 20 mins the player freezes, so you have to reset it using the recessed button. The file system also has problems, I have several zero length files in the player that can not be deleted. I also hungs if you press the wrong key when recording from radio.It seems that the firmware was never tested :-("
0,Don't buy them,I have tried five different types of bottles and these are horrible. Don't waste your money. Dr. Brown's is the way to go!
1,Beltin Blake,"Oh, to hear 'The Baby' played on your radio for the first time,(thinking ""Wow, what an excellent voice!"" Viewing the video played for the first time (even more powerful effect...gives me the impression of Jesus Christ with that deep blue-eyed stare). Then to top things off, seeing Blake perform live (Taylorville IL) is enough to really get the freshman listeners to love him and his music. He comes out belting 'Heavy Liftin' and ends with 'The Baby!' The Dreamer is a must buy! Love his rockin' music, organ playing, guitar strumming songs of his life and southern roots! It was worth the 800 mile round trip to Central IL from a southwest suburb just outside of Chicago!"
1,"A glimpse into Eternity, into the Heart of God","In the tradition of Teresa of Avila, John of the Cross and Madame Guyon, Ann and Albert (""Anna"") Rountree take you on a thrilling spiritual quest into deeper intimacy with Jesus Christ, the heavenly Bridegroom, who patiently and persistently challenges you to pursue the prize of the upward call.Adventure into a breathtaking revelation of how you, as Christian believers, are being prepared to become the Bride of Christ. You will uncover a hidden map of bridal sanctification as you explore the ancient betrothal process revealed in ""The Priestly Bride"".""The Priestly Bride"" is a glimpse into eternity, a preview of the consummation of the ages. Thank you, ""Anna"", for giving us a glimpse into the eternal chambers of God's incredible love for His chosen ones."
0,Worked For 2 Months Then Broke,The Krups FLF3 Stainless-Steel 54-Ounce Electric Kettle worked for 2 months before the kettle's lid broke. The lid jammed onto the top of the kettle. Took some time to remove it.I always hear that Krups have good designs. Guess it's marketing thing. Don't think I'll be a customer in their future.
0,love and hate,"Got this as a gift. I enjoy and the immersion blender and the food processor. I thought I would use the whisk all the time, as I always make my own whipped cream. I LOVED the whisk attachment, LOVED it! But after 5 uses, it didn't work any more, seemed like it stripped the gears. Huge disappointment."
1,Review of Civilisation ma mere!,"I am also reading this book for my French class. I found it a thoroughly enjoyable read. It's an excellent study of Maghrebian culture and the emancipation of a pure-hearted woman. It's humourous and a great book to read, even for those who aren't forced to read it for school!"
0,Unique artist,"At the time I purchased this CD, I did not know much about Brahms or Schumann. After listening to this CD of the Brahms and Schumann Violin concerto and comparing it with other big name violinists, you can see that the quality of this violinist is nowhere near the greats, such as Perlman or Gil Shaham.The Japanese violinist in this album is unique in that he is blind. I found that to be really unique and inspiring for a classical musician. However, there are parts in this album where he is a little out of tune and the runs are not completely clean. Having said that, I would avoid purchasing this album."
1,"Nice handheld shower, a little more flexible would be better","Kids love this. I personally felt the tube could have been a little more flexible. It was stiff after few days of use. Connecting was easy, and the number of flexible settings is definitely good. No leaks. Packaging was a real pain to open, needed a scissor and a sharp paper cutter to open it. Why do the packages so hard. I wish this had come in Amazon frustration free packaging."
1,Better Earl Grey (Decaf) than Bigelow,"I compared the reviews for all of the Earl Grey teas on Amazon, and the reviews said Bigelow (Decaf) was better than Twinings and Stash, so I purchased it. I also purchased Choice Organic (Decaf) at the same time.I have been comparing the two, and I find that Choice Organic is actually stronger per bag and tastes better. Even though it is in bags, it almost is as good as loose leaf. It is a little higher in price, but it seems like it is good quality. They must've changed the formula since skacleve's review in 2009 below, though not sure."
0,Music For The Police State,"In between stumping for republican politicians like Jeb Bush the ORB make music designed to appeal to those very same Republican politicians. `American Made', get it? Be Afraid, be very afraid."
1,wow,"Although I knew this would be a very hard book to read, I found myself not able to put it down. As a native of Florence & a Clemson student, the book more than intrigued me. Although I'm sure some stuff had to be exaggerated, I thought this was an amazing expose of the nature of some Greek organizations... one that most people don't want to talk about at all. I'm terribly sorry that this happened to the author, but I'm glad that he's able to put everything into words & hopefully help others.For any of you considering coming to Clemson, please know that his experience was far from the norm. I have found that my years there have been some of the most wonderful in my life. I have found a wonderful, embracing community, & I hope that others can find that too, wherever they go!"
1,comfortable,These were very comfortable and VERY lightweight. You can wipe them clean and disinfect which is great.
0,Agenda pushing and altogether not interesting,"First, this book definitely has an agenda to push. It's not balanced look at the New Deal, the people behind it and what it did do right. It's an attack on FDR. Political, self-serving books that pose as history lessons are bad to begin with.But that aside, I jsut found this book to not be alltogether that well written. It went on and on at times, citing endless research, but never striving to drive the point home. Instead it wanted to point out problems in the New Deal using numbers and statistics that have been debated over and over."
1,Fox really dropped the ball,"I happened to be home friday night and saw the first airing of this show. It was great! It had been a while since I laughed so much at a show and I watched it the following weeks as well. Then I discovered Fox had dropped the show. What were they thinking? Fox it seems, is too caught up on instant ratings. A lot of good shows need to grow their fan base. Unfortunetly, this show didn't even have time to do that. If I was over the exec. that decided to drop this show I would have had him fired! Great show, I'm buying the DVD to see the other 9 episodes that didn't air and hopefully they will be just as great! To bad another network didn't see the potential and pick it up."
1,Good movie.,I was happy how fast it came. It was a very interesting movie. The children really enjoyed watching it also.
1,Great reception,"Overall, a great FM transmitter and lightyears ahead of the Griffin Nanotrip.+ Good sound quality with little static on many frequencies.+ Runs off ubiquitous AAA batteries and doesn't drain IPOD. Can also run off DC.+ Can be adjusted to even or odd frequencies.+ Simple interface, easy to plug in or unplug.+ Will work with any device that outputs through headphone jack.+ Good price- Not as slick looking as some IPOD transmitters."
0,Over Priced! Criminally So!,"At $299 what are you getting over the Model One at $149? A $150 analog Alarm Clock ($299-$149=$150). That's Re'dic'er'us!! That said, Tivoli makes a great product...but unless you've money to burn--buy the Model One and get a $12 alarm clock."
1,Only thing that works!,"I've been using frontline for years in the months that I let my cat outdoors. I lived with some roommates last year who brought a NASTY flea infestation into the apartment (literally so bad their cat ended up becoming anemic and then passed away..). They wanted to do flea bombs and all kinds of crazy traps to attempt to get rid of the fleas, none of which worked it was so bad, so I put my foot down and no more of that and got frontline for our cats. Within a couple of months they were gone. Unfortunately their cat had to suffer due to their unwillingness to pay the cost of living with an animal and lack of speed with veterinary care."

0,Ha ha! It's funny!,"This film was the dumbest thing since alien pops with cheese, but I loved it! ""Wham! Bap! Zang!"" were constantly being showed in combat scenes. Batman Forever was the best because it was seriouse (see my review on it), but this film (although stupid) is downright funny! Ha ha! This movie does not (or so it seems) even make an attempt to be serious. See it anyway and laugh you pants off!"
1,Jackie on tenor,"If you dig Jackie this side will interest you greatly. It is the only recording of Jackie on tenor that i know of. You can hear a whole lot of Sonny Rollins here, but unmistably Jackie McLean.Also there is a great argument between Jackie and Gil Coggins.I love this side.peace"
0,Science fiction hiding in Star Wars clothing,"I must say that this book was a disappointment to me. The story wasn't bad, and Greg Bear is an above average sci-fi writer. But take out the words Jedi Knight and change the main characters' names and you will see the book has little to do with the Star Wars universe and the characters who populate it. If anything, Bear writing seems contained because he is trying to make it fit into the Star Wars mold.Not bad sci-fi, but not a good Star Wars tale."
0,What the ????????,"This is what passes for humorous writing these days? Pollack has some cleverness--but not much else. He's a poseur, and his pose isn't even original. The only way to entertain yourself while reading this tedious and pretentious little book is to ask yourself, ""Who is he trying to imitate in this piece?"" Pollack is so unfunny that he makes Dave Barry look like S. J. Perelman. Pollack is is a run-of-the-mill McSweeney's narcissist. That he has fans--that people show up for his readings with intentions other than those of heckling him or shouting him down--is a distressing indication of how stupid the ""hipster"" reading public has become. The McSweeney's publishing operation is little more than a vanity-press outfit."
1,Very Funny!!!,"I received this as a Christmas present, and I thought it was really good and really funny! Will and John are awesome together and make a perfect team! I loved all the hilarious situations they got in. I love when they make the dad mad when they make a rap video on his boat. I also love when they screw up their interviews. I would highly recommend STEP BROTHERS!!!"
0,Toasting is a hastle,"To toast, you turn a dial to turn it on and never know just how ""done"" it's going to get. They should have made it like a regular toaster where you can set the darkness with a dial, and just push a switch to start toasting. I bought this as a gift, and was embarrassed by it being to cumbersome."
1,There ain't nobody that can bend a string like stevie did.,"I think we were all very lucky to have a guy like StevieRay pick up a guitar,but what I want to know is where is the material from the Night- Crawlers+Triple-Threat?l"
0,Disappointed,"Received a battery operating portable fan (model #1041) instead of the misting fan. Emailed the company, will post back once I know how they corrected it. Hoping they do!"
1,The best depiction of the times Written..Malcom is eloquent,"When I originally became interested in reading this book, I wasn't sure what I would find. I expected to unearth racial doctrines, and reiterated black power. What I found instead was the tender, intelligent voice of an entire generation of african americans. Indeed the eloquent Malcom X, using Alex Haley, as his microphone took me through the story of his life, and of his times. A must read for anyone pursuing history, philosophy, humanities, or Life."
0,"Not worth Amazon's price, barely worth Rand McNally's price",Amazon charges $3.94 for this item. It's barely worth the $1.95 that is stamped on the upper right hand corner of the map by Rand McNally themselves. Pretty much a rip off. I should have sent it back.
1,This Album Is Mighty Fine So Says ME,"This album is amazing. a fine pice of energetic and melodic goth punk rock. a great buy! BUY IT (or even better, why not copy it and very punkily flip the bird at those capitalist pigs!)"
1,I finally have a tv in the kitchen,"What a great product. Hooked it up to my DVR satellite box set the code, put my tv on cable and set it to AV, and boom I had tv. The only thing I wish is that I could change channels from the tv itself instead of having to go into the other room and change it from the box, but other than that it's great. I can even watch the shows I recorded. Clear picture."
1,Gossamer the best book,"I'm 11 and absolutely LOVE Lois Lowry! This book is a great book for kids and adults it has a fairly easy vocabulary and a deeper concept. If you love or hate reading you will love this. Unless you have a loving book boy I would not recommend this for boys, this is definitely a girl book."
1,A great book for survival,i thought this was a great book and i recommend it for anyone interested in the subject of survival
1,joseph- rickman,"Great book , and a great class on early American history. The book got here quickly and the information I learned was enjoyable."
1,awesome soundtrack,specially if you already have the movie because Jesses first song and Mya song on this disk are too reasons to buy this cd everythin else sucks except for Hil's songs and the song they play when there dancing about her eyes i love that one too sooo get this disk
0,"Decent, but could be much better","The plot is pretty good and I like the quick pace. BUT... the typographical errors and confusing dialogue are enough to drive a person insane! Lines are occasionally ended in mid-sentence only to begin again in a new paragraph. Several times, the wrong term is used (example: ""poll"" instead of ""pole""). Quotations marks are often in the wrong place or missing all together. And speaking of the dialogue, it's very hard to figure out who is saying what half the time because the conversation is lumped into a paragraph instead of being seperated by who is speaking. What this book needs is a good proofreader!..."
1,Dead,"In response to the last review. You attack Simon by saying he cites sources that contradict themselves, yet you are bias on this and you contradict yourself but not stating anything even remote of scientific eveidence. It seems, you missed the whole point of the book! So if you like reading occult, please grow up, the Necronomicon is not for kids, and by this I mEan kids, as most adults act indeed like little kids today. What do you know about the Necronomicon, to even review on this subject.? May the Elder gods have mercy on your soul!"
0,Weird movie,My husband and I really didn't like this. It got some good reviews so we thought we'd give it a try and I'm upset that I wasted my money on it!
1,Pleasantly Surprised by this Remake,"I really enjoyed this movie and recommend it highly. Keanu Reeves, Jennifer Connelly, Kathy Bates did a fantastic job (as did the rest of the cast). The movie paid hommage to the original movie. The only odd thing I found was that The Secretary of Defense (Kathy Bates) was the most senior government leader you see during the entire movie. Considering this is an event affecting the entire world, it seemed a little odd. Overall, a good watch for any science fiction enthusiasts."
1,Game of Thrones season 1,The first season of Game of Thrones was very good. It covers the entire book of the same name. The show was well made and did a good job of capturing the feel of the book.At only ten episodes this season seems more like a mini series than a television series season.
0,Can't stand them,"I've owned these for a few months now. I can't figure out what you can cook with them that doesn't stick like crazy. You can cook on a low temperature with a 1/2"" of oil or butter in the bottom of the frying pans, and yet food still sticks! You may be able to saute some veggies in oil, but forget browning potatoes (they will end up mashed), and don't even try eggs... they are a disaster. I don't want to be an ""artist"", I just want some hot food that I don't have to chisel off the bottom of my pots and pans.Even if you are merely boiling water for mac-n-cheese with the small pots, you better be stirring CONSTANTLY. The noodles in contact with the bottom of the pot will stick fast.There is a reason Teflon was invented. If you like to chisel food off the bottom of your pans when cooking or washing, get these. If you want no-stick, avoid. My $20 Coleman camping cook set does a better job than these."
1,Great stool and very attractive!,"I used stools like this when I worked in kitchens. They always worked great but too commercial looking. Finally, a great step stool that works extremely well and looks very classy. My kids use it too. Its wonderful!"
0,Caution! This is NOT a normal Audiobook.,"This audio book was sold as ""Audio CD"" it is not, it is an MP3 CD and will not play on a regular CD player. It would be very helpful to note that in the listing.I bought this to play on in my car during a long road trip, without buying an MP3 player, car-converter, and having my computer handy to reformat these disks, this product was useless to me.It may be a GREAT book, I'm just not happy I have to juggle formats to find out."
0,Review of The Science of Harry Potter,"Woah- This book was obviously very well researched and thought out. Whats-his-name went to a lot of effort to write this book. Though, as an obsessive 15 year old harry potter fan, it didn't make me happy! It took all the magic out of the books. it explained how every bit of magic the book had could be really happening, but with out magic! He took the all the fun out of it! When i bought it i thought it would tell me how the magic worked, not how it wasn't real. i was highly offended."
0,Stay way,These are way too expensive and are terrible. I have a small dog and the pads leak onto my wood floors constantly.
0,"Challengers Rock, But This Album Does Not","The Challengers are one of the finest instrumental surf bands ever, but this album lacks their magic touch. Aside from the slick cover of ""Hava Nagila"" and ""Apache,"" the cd has tepid takes of songs like ""On Broadway."" Only for the most hardcore Challengers fans. If you want a good dose of this great group, I recommend ""Killer Surf,"" their ""Best Of"" collection."
1,"Hesitant? Let me give you a hand... or a leg, or a head.","In the wake of this fantastic book, I'm left with little to say other than the bar has been set very high: Badal's peerless effort represents historic true crime at it's absolute best, and joins the ranks of definitive accounting's such as Sugden'sComplete History of Jack the Ripper. Kudos!"
0,I hated this calendar,"""Rumi, Heart of the beloved"" is a million times better. This one has an awful design and I am not sure if it's about Rumi it looks to me like the designer had something else (than Rumi) in mind when designing this. With all due respect, this is an awful job."
1,4.5 Stars... almost perfect.,"First of all I would like to say I love this game and think it is the best driving game, at least for the Dreamcast. But I really would've liked multiplayer and also the game gets boring after 30-45 min of playing. (It's not one of those games you play for really long periods of time, but you have many short plays) Overall it lots of fun... Buy it!"
1,"This is the BOOK, not the Movie/DVD !!!!","I'm not sure how so many reviewers managed to mix up the two . . . anyway, the nature and tone of the book are vastly different (and in my mind, much more entertaining) than that of the movie. Winston Groom's ""Gump"" is filled with side-splitting ironic humor, as well as an healthy skepticism of the various powers that be that the protagonist encounters. My guess is that people who saw the movie first will be disappointed by the lack of sentimentality in the book - but if you are one of the handfull of people remaining on the planet who have not seen the movie, PLEASE read the book first - it's hilarious and life-affirming, without falling into the maudlin trappings that (at least in my mind) diminished the movie."
0,Dont buy,"This listing makes you think you will receive two boots, for the price it looks correct. Surprise they send only one boot. Jokes on me. So dont get fooled. good luck, stay away"
1,Nice Tale,"This book was abosrbing, once it got going. It seemed to take a LONG time before a ""story"" developed. However, McMurtry spends a lot of time setting and introducing the characters. Sad book, about the final gasps of the Old West. I noticed, however, that some of the characters seemed quite a bit like the ones from Lonesome Dove... Same mannerisms and habits, which was a bit bothersome. Otherwise worth reading!"
0,Dangerous Sippy Cup,"I bought two for my 3-year-old son and 1-year-old son about 3 months ago. Few weeks ago, I found one of the soft spout broken and found a piece in my younger son's month. I stopped to let him use it immediately. I thought he bit it so that the spout was broken. However, it happened again to my elder son's cup last week. He never bit or chew it, but the spout still broken apart. It should be some problem with the spout material. I am glad they were not chocking by this product and going to report it."
0,Merely adequate,This product serves the purpose as a speaker for your system. So if that is all you need then it's the right product for you. There are better products that have remote controls. If you want something that doesn't feel flimsy and fragile then this isn't the product for you.
1,Better than the soaps,I absolutely loved this book. I only wish I had been more cognizant of the events as they were happening (I was young at the time). Forden truly captures all of the bastardly splendor of Gucci and made me nostalgic for the Tom Ford days.
0,It scares me that this book could be published,"The author is clearly trying to help beginners design better code, but I find it frightening that people are reading this book and putting his ideas into practice.James Cooper does not understand the essence of the patterns that he is trying to explain. He gets the patterns wrong from the start and then spends pages working his way out of the traps that he has set for himself.Please do not buy this book, unless you are looking for somehting to amaze your friends with. I seriously thought that this book was a hoax at first, and a pretty sick one at that."
0,Drop In Quality,"I had purchased a Remington Titanium about five years ago and loved it! After dropping these clippers several times over the years and through regular wear-and-tear, however, it was time to get a new unit. Unsurprisingly, I purchased another Titanium.Unfortunately, I was punished for my loyalty.While I can't comment on the supplementary pieces as I don't use them, the unit itself saw more metal components substituted with plastic; the cord length was halved; and the motor appeared weaker or blades were/went dull (stalls frequently when cutting my hair.) Forget salon quality ... these clippers are not even suited for casual home use.I'm sure the executives behind these 'quality' choices are enjoying their bonuses. I, on the other hand, am disappointed with their product and will avoid buying a Remington -- of any sort - in the future."
1,The power of now,"Enlightening, liberating, and insightful. Requires several reads to comprehend the deep meanings. Could bring peace in your mind. Highly recommended."
0,Size of fan,"This fan is advertised as a 20"" fan. When I receiced it, the fan is clearly marked on the box as an 18"" fan. Not only was it NOT the size advertised, but it is poorly packed and damaged enroute to me."
1,Turner does it justice,"Nikki Turner's ""Riding Dirty on I-95"" (yes i know putting book titles in quotation marks is grammatically incorrect)is a well wriitten tale of street life, struggle, and love. Although it lacks some details and I did figure out some things in the book before hand (like what Cleezy's mom did & how Cleezy and Mercy were connected)its still a good book and tells a good story. Go buy it, its worth it"
1,A decent little piece of Geek jewelry,"Pretty good item for the money you spend for it. It's a fairly simple piece of jewelry, about an inch in length and fairly light. You can't quite tell from the pictures, but it's missing the back half to allow it to lay on the skin better. That may be a good, or a bad thing for you, depending what you're looking for."
1,Good Read,"The only thing I didn't like about this book was that I thought it was very predictable -- the killer was easy to spot right from the beginning. However, it was a fun read and I look forward to the next book by this author."
1,"Smart, complex and packing a very entertaining, satisfying punch -- Not a combo we see very often these days.","Who knew Milla was such a great actress!!? Apparently Gary Lennon did since he cast her in a role we might not usually see her play, and with truly stunning consequences. Her performance is brave, dark, compelling and utterly human - as is the movie as a whole. Angus McFaden is also brilliant as a childlike monster whose charistmatic cruelty helps make this an artfully crafted and very thoughtful piece of cinema."
0,Colony WARS? Where'd the war go?,"This is the worst of the series, no doubt in my mind. First and foremost most of the missions are just moneymakers. They don't influence the course of the game. If you ask me, if you go off and sell yourself to the Imperial Navy (the ""empiret"") then why would the League want to hire someone who has sold themselves to the otherside repeatedly.My other complaint is the lack of connection with the last game. If you haven't played or completed Colony Wars: Vengence skip this paragraph. If I understood the ending (the only REAL ending of Vengence) then there was something of a peace between the League and the Navy, yet from the very beginning that wasn't there. What happened?This game was a disappointment after Colony Wars and Vengence. *sigh*"
1,Excellent Australian TV miniseries,"Six young Australian soldiers are captured by the Japanese and interred in Changi prison camp. Each of the six 1-hour episodes covers one man's recollections, as they meet for their last reunion. Each of the 12 principal actors is very good (six as the young soldiers and six as their older counterparts). This is the kind of engrossing story that you'll never see on American TV. The violence of their captors is quite graphic, but the humor they use to survive offsets it nicely. I highly recommend it."
0,Antique copper?,"I realize I probably should have read the description a little more carefully so that I would have seen that it was resin, but I'm not a huge fan. It seems pretty cheap. With shipping, it seems a little steep for 30 dollars for how cheap it seems."
0,Disgusting,"I can't even GIVE these things away. The best description I can come up with is ""Sawdust surrounded by wax."" Does not taste like white chocolate (or ANY type of chocolate) in the least. I've yet to know anyone who can actually swallow a bite of one of these. I have a ""HELP YOURSELF"" sticky note on the box at the office and everyone who has tried it, has SPIT IT OUT and tossed it in the trash. Save your money."
1,This particular set can be had from Scholastics ...,"I love the blue covered set of encyclopedias. They seem very durable and colorful. My children started reading Volume A as though it was a book. It had easy to read articles with detailed color photos. It goes into some depth without getting too technical, but covering subjects surprisingly well.You can get a free copy of Volume 1/A at scholastic books. But you will have to cancel or by the whole set when volume 2/B arrives. The price is actually good, comparatively. Don't pay any extra for special shipping -- try the trial version."
0,Warranty is a scam,"3 outlets failed within 5 months of owning this !!I called Amazon, they said that they wont take it back because it is a warranty issue -- and said to call BelkinI called Belkin, (the customer support line is overseas and has a VERY bad connection with people who can barely speak English) and they want me to pay the return shipping (Even though it is within warranty-- and it is obviously a faulty product !!!)THis is the first company I ever had a return with who actually expects the customer to pay for shipping when the product is FAULTY and within warranty !!!I don't plan to buy from Belkin ever again"
1,Wizard of Oz - Childhood memories,"I finally found this video on Amazon - and in Blue Ray. I was looking for it for the step-grandchildren as they had no idea about the magic of this movie (and neither had their parents!). It was a wonderful DVD, the colors, the clarity, the sound. It took me back many years and was thoroughly enjoyed by not only the grandchildren who were mesmerized but also by mother, dad and granddad!"
0,intro to matlab by Broenkow,"This book is indeed a basic text - however it misses the mark a bit and is a bit too basic ! For example - in several places the author describes the early development of computers in general and not the development of MATLAB (iam not to sure that such a history would be relevent anyway). Even so, the use of MATLAB glossarys is good and the inclsuion of various M-Files with the CD is a good idea. But what ever possesed the publisher to create the book solely on CD ! This is a terrible format to produce books in - i had to spend 3 days by the printer waiting for the chapers to come out - the additional expense that was incurred by me enraged me ! A collection of PDF files on CD ROM should not cost 25 dollars ! for this price i would expect a text book as well as the cd rom - if this is the trend that will be picked up by publisher then we are all in for some rough times ahead !"
0,Ishmael...aaahhhh,"This book stinks! Aren't you supposed to actually understand it. When I had finished it (because the school assigned it), I burned it and then ate it! This book is like a dictionary. Step away kids, this book is dangerous."
1,Great - simple awesome,"This grater is the best , simple to use and does an awesome job . Teh blade is fabricated with such precision it is a wonder on its own . Great products :-)"
1,Better than I thought they'd be!,"I had my doubts on their performance, as I have been fishing rivers for over 40 years and usually snag and break a line at least twice each outting and have tried everything!But these have truly out performed everything and have done as they claimed!I have ""NOT"" lost one yet to a snag and still on first one I tied to my pole and have been out river fishing at least 6 times!I bought 6 of them and wonder if and when I'll ever lose one!Great sinker Lindy!!!"
1,comfortable in hot weather,"These shorts are surprisingly comfortable in hot weather, considering they're part cotton and hold some moisture. My only complaint is that the waist is very high."
1,Awesome Movie,"This movie is AWESOME. I watch it over and over again. I have gotten other people loving it too. Based loosely on a true story of the Apollo 11 mission to the moon. After watching this movie, I hope to someday go to Australia to see ""The Dish"""
0,Beware NON GERMAN manufactured knives substitution.,"Buyers should be aware that the description of the knives on this site; as clearly depicted; does not necessarily mean that the knives that arrive may be made in(as in my experience Spain, Thailand or China. Even though the packaging indicates German made and instructions shows German made, the knives that arrived were Spanish made. The return policy may be alright for locals purchasers but adding half the cost of the product to return it from Australia is not cost effective. My concerns re the issue have not been responded to."
0,Disappointing,"I bought this cd off of amazon after reading many rave reviews of it but this is not a good cd for Puddle of Mudd. I am disappointed with it. Dont buy this cd, save your money!!"
0,Do not purchase!!! Does not deserve even one star!!,"I purchased this video in the hope of educating a tour group about Mexico. It is AWFUL. The tour guide agreed with me and would not show it. It is basically a string of home video clips with boring, overly general statements dubbed on top. Don't be as gullible as I was--this is a waste of money!!!!"
0,Don't waste your money,"I had always used the QUE series of books for MS Office reference. These are bloated goats now, only stating the obvious. I'm an intermediate / advanced user but no VB. I need a reference to tell me why new things I'm trying don't work or how features interact. Not what the feature is ""supposed to do"". When I find more useful info on the Microsoft Support page.... you know the book is a waste. Stay away from this one, unless you are brand newbie..."
1,Capacitor tester works great,Product works very well you don't have to know anything at to use it took up the wires to tell if it's the right 1 go to bed will buy more from them
1,Best Book I've Ever Read!,"I can honestly say Baby Catcher is the best book I have ever read. I cried through chapters, laughed, and had moments when I closed the book to just think. I identified with the women givign birth and with Peggy Vincent as the midwife, catching those babies! I loved hearing about her life as a wife and mother, and how being a midwife impacted those roles. I did not want this book to end. I want everyone I know to read this book because it has impacted me so much and I want them to be a part of that!Whether birth is your passion or you would just like to know a bit more about it, this book is a great read! I recommend it to everyone! It is also a great gift idea for expecting parents."
1,pleased,"I have just started crocheting with wire and out of the approximately 10 books I have collected, this one is my favorite. It has good information in it along with helpful directions. The pictures of the jewelry and baskets are beautiful. I like the projects because they are different without being something too over-the-top for the average person to actually wear."
1,GREAT TRUE STORY,THIS IS A REAL EYE OPENER ON HOW AA WAS STARTED. YOU'LL LEARN SO MUCH ABOUT THIS TERRIBLE DISEASE AND YOU'LL COME AWAY HAVING SO MUCH MORE COMPASSION FOR THOSE SUFFERING FROM IT. A MUST SEE FOR ANYONE LIVING WITH THE DISEASE OR ANYONE LIVING WITH AN ALCOHOLIC. THE COMPANY I ORDERED FROM WAS WONDERFUL AND GOT IT OUT THE DAY I ORDERED IT AND I RECEIVED IT WITHIN 3 OR 4 DAYS.
1,quick and easy,"Bought this product to fill some small crevices around my wood burning fireplaces that were bothering me. I was worried sparks could get in the cracks and cause problems. This product was easy to use and works very well. The gray is kind of dark. I was actually looking for a lighter gray, but it still looks fine."
0,Bad buy for the price!,"I was really excited to receive the Bushnell Instant Replay as a birthday present. However, I quickly learned that it's an incredibly difficult binocular to operate. First of all, I had trouble opening the battery compartment cover. I had to pry it out with a knife after many unsuccessful attempts. Then I had a hard time installing the Flash Memory card. The instruction booklet was terrible and did not mention the right way to instal it. I installed it the wrong way and it got jammed so I had to pry it out with a pair of pliers!! After doing all that, I got the camera to work. Then I decided I had to instal the software - the driver and the Photosuite. The driver was installed easily. Not so the Photosuite. After three attempts, the icon did not appear nor did it appear on Programs. I'm returning the camera!"
1,WE'RE GONNA WALK ALL OVER YOU!!!,"First off, let me state that I am in no way, shape, or form, ""old-school."" I was about eight years old when this album came out. Luckily, I had older relatives who turned me on to these types of bands, and I'm very thankful they did. That being said, this album is classic from start to finish. If you are new to Overkill, this is a good start (By the way, you also can't go wrong with their debut ""Feel the Fire,"" but I digress...). This band has a huge catalog of music which will most definitely not disappoint. Also, if you find you like this album, you might want to check out a film that was put out by Rat Skates (Overkill's original drummer) entitledBorn in The Basement. It is an outstanding film that covers not only the formation of Overkill, but also how Rat epitomized the ""DIY"" philosophy; whether it be the stage layout or promotion. That being said, THRASH OR BE THRASHED!!!"
0,Too much static electricity,This Mason Pearson brush has so much static electricity it renders it impossible to use. I don't know if it's an issue with the nylon or an issue with all their brushes.
0,Don't bother with this microscope,"Bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas and am VERY disappointed. I didn't expect a ""real"" microscope, but this one is made from flimsy plastic and won't hold focus at all, no matter how hard you try. If you want a microscope that is junk, you can get one for $15.00 - not $60.00. Wish I could get my money back! My granddaughter doesn't like it either; she's 11 years old and a science buff - she has no interest in it because she can't see anything. You might as well throw $60.00 out your car window."
1,Awesome!,This film has some of the best fight scenes I have seen in a while. And the fact that it's based on a true story makes it even better.
1,Takes the joy out of a road trip!!,"Joy Ride starts out with a boy deciding to take a road trip and picks up his just bailed from jail brother on the way. While on the road the boys are messing with some people on their radio, using the code name Candy Cane. Well they ""run into"" Rusty Nail on the frequency and tell him to meet them obviously leaving him a false location. Rusty Nail seems to have a bad attitude about the whole trick and an innocent man ends up dead. On the road the next day the boys run into Rusty Nail again.....will they escape??? Watch this Thriller for a scary suprise ending that will make you think twice the next time you want to set out on a pleasant Joy Ride."
0,I don't like this!,"I was trying to replace a peel off mask I had in college over 10 yrs ago but couldn't remember the name; it left my face soft and it was easy to peel off and it didnt have a strong smell, but this product is the opposite. This product is messy to apply and thick, and it takes a long time to dry and I don't see a difference in my face when I take it off. I left it in the draw with all the other products I don't really use because they do nothing special. I mean really!!!"
1,"Megadeth's ""Tattoo You""","This will probably go down as one of Megadeth's five best albums. It's everything a Megadeth fan craves, especially after Dave and Co. experimented with their distinctive sound for several records. This is mostly back-to-basics thrash by any definition.Megadeth's career arc reminds me a lot of the Rolling Stones: A legendary early batch of albums, then several years of allowing certain musical trends to influence their songs. The Stones finally went back to their roots with ""Tattoo You"" and basically said, ""This is who we really are."" ""The System Has Failed"" is that kind of record. Rock solid, honest, and thoroughly enjoyable."
0,If you believe that pink elephants fly,"Trust me, this stuff... and anything ""oxytocin"" is complete snake oil. I guess if you believe strongly enough that spraying tap water on yourself will attract women, then it will! lol Save your money dudes!"
0,powerful unit.,It's more powerful than the one we have before.Since I have it not very long that i do notb know how long it will be last.So far so good.
1,Wonderful childbirth stories,"The stories in this book, of natural childbirth, are truly wonderful. The book focuses on the circumstances, the experience, the miracle of each birth, even the ones that didn't proceed textbook-perfect. These stories are touching, and heartening for someone who's lost faith in our healthcare system."
1,Good product,"Good price since I didn't have to go to the store for it but the cost is comparable to most stores. But fresh and quality the same as that in the store. I do a lot of gluten free and pale cooking. This is great product.,"
0,IT WAS A BORING AND DULL BOOK!,It was not very intersting at all . A five year old could read it and it would be boring to them. Instead of having it recommended for 7th graders it should be for a 5th grader. We are to advansed for that book.
0,The star is for the book not stories,"First there is little explaination these are RE-printed stories from other books and mags. Second I still have not stumbled on the Marion Zimmer Bradley story, a primary reason for getting this book. At least the price came down and most tales are good if you have not already read them else where."
1,Moneyball is great!,"I love baseball and generally love movies about baseball. This movie is a slightly different twist on the usual ""bad team comes back to win"" theme. I was intrigued by the forward thinking of the general manager in the movie and absolutely loved this movie. I generally don't buy a movie unless it's one that I really love--and Moneyball is one of those."
1,"Bulbs are lasting so far, no issues... only one problem...",I can't get them clean! It's not that big of a deal but it seems like the dirt is inside the bulb :(Other than that I love them!
1,Was a great bread and buy -- for four months,"I liked the GF Pantry bread mix so well I signed up to have automatic deliveries. Unfortunately, after my initial purchase, I only received one additional shipment before the offer was discontinued and the price of the product went up considerably! I liked this brand because it has reasonably good texture and taste (compared with regular bread) and for a gluten-free it required minimal additional (and less costly) ingredients compared to other mixes I've tried. For now, I'm experiencing with other GF bread mixes I hadn't tried earlier and am leaning towards ""Pamela's."" One other note on the ""Pantry's"" mix, IMO the bread's texture is better and it freezes better if it isn't cooked as long as directed."
0,Overrated mess,"Other than a couple of killer tracks, this CD is pretty repetitious and boring when you really listen to it. 'Illin' in Heaven' is a total waste of disc space (the 'F' word repeated ad naseum - how deep), plus 'Praise You' sounds an awful lot like 'Unbelievable' by EMF. The Housemartins (Cook's band from the 80's) simply blow this mess away. No they weren't dance pop, but they had far more depth and variety than found on this limp CD."
1,Nice pump,"This pump really works for me. I work part-time, and have to pump on other occasions too, and it works well. I can usually do both sides in about 20 minutes all together. It really helps the milk let down, and gets it at a fast pace. At first, it may seem a little too strong for suction, but you get used to it. It feels a lot better than the Single Deluxe electric pump. The breast shield is also very comfortable."
1,Some of the best love poetry ever written,"Elizabeth Barrett Browning's poetry, especially the ""Sonnets from the Portuguese,"" is beautiful, intelligent, and honest love poetry. Anyone who has experienced the doubts, fears, and transformation of love will recognize the truth of the poet's struggle to trust and to love."
0,Buy Something Else,"The quality control on this product is poor (Pyle Pro PYLPDWM2700 Dual Channel 2 Wireless Mic). The first one I ordered had a intermittent handheld microphone (move it a certain way and it would loose battery power). I sent the whole set back and the second set had an intermittent channel in the wireless receiver which would randomly start making noise on its own and then saturate the signal to full volume. This was without a wireless transmitter even turned on. I sent it back and didn't want to try a 3rd.Also, the plug used for the wireless headset is unique to this brand and would limit the ability to replace just the headset if needed.Yes it's cheap for what it might deliver, but the hassle of trying new units to find a set that would work is not worth it. Spend more and get a better product."
0,A Groan Thing,We saw the trailer for this movie on another DVD rental and it looked like it was going to be a great comedy. Unfortunately the trailer contains all of the laughs. The guy who edited the trailer deserves an Oscar and then be shot. We wanted to like this one. We tried twice make it through the whole movie and couldn't make it either time. It was that bad. No it was worse. The lead actor is so over the top and stupid that he rendered the movie unwatchable all by himself. I can't imagine what James Brolin had to say to Barbara when he screened this one for her. Hopefully the paycheck was really big. Other than Stiles we have to say: Terrible acting - Awful Script - Insipid Humor. What a disappointment!
0,Huh? This games graphics seem 2000 years old!!!,"I don't understand who likes this game? The graphics are VERY ancient. There also is no adventure to this game. The only thing you do is level, and level, and level. The adventure tasks that your trainer gives you have about 30 words in them, that's all. 30 words that's all, thats the big adventure in this game? To show that your in a city, there are 4 or 5 stones around in a circle, thats it. I think a high school student could of done a much better job. By the way I only played Midgard, I don't know about the other realms.But don't take my word for it, you can download and play for free. Just check out the graphics, and redundant music, its embarrassing. Go to the co. main website download the game and play for free if you really want to see BAD."
0,Truly a waste of two hours,"It takes a lot to drive me to write a review, but this film has just wasted two hours of mine and my husband's time, and therefore I feel strongly about it. We were attracted to the film because of the fantastic cast, and they did act beautifully. However, this was a long drawn out story with a beginning and a middle, but no end. It was painfully slow, and with hindsight, we should have given up after the first long painful hour, but we persevered in the hope it would improve. None of the characters were likeable, and therefore it was difficult to care what happened to them.... and given that the scriptwriter couldn't be bothered to create an end for the film, I can only assume he felt similarly."
1,Glen Campbell never fails to please.,"In 1967, Glen Campbell's ""Gentle On My Mind"" was the first L.P. I ever purchased, and I've been buying Glen's records (and CDs) ever since. ""Somebody Like That"" lives up to all expectations, and there's even a booklet with the lyrics (just in case you are brave enough to sing along!) Unfortunately, on track 9 ""(If I'd Only Known) It Was The Last Time"", there are four verses printed, but Glen only sings the first three, repeating the third verse and leaving the fourth out entirely. It's a great song and I almost feel cheated, as I now really want to hear that last verse! Anybody out there got a copy of the entire song? Apart from that, if you're a Glen Campbell fan and don't have this CD, go on out and buy it. You won't be sorry."
1,Complete,"I have read many holocaust books of survival but this one left a mark on my heart. The story of a teenage girl, beginning to grow up and notice boys is suddenly thrust into concentration camp after concentration camp. Being torn from her family and placed in a Hell she didn't deserve or understand. This book is hard to read(emotionally)but is one of the greatest I have ever read. I will never forget it."
1,Absolutely a blast...a kick in the pants!,"This DVD is a lot of fun to listen to. It's not quite as much fun to watch, but the music is fantastic and the sound quality was great for a DVD. I listen to it at work on a Dell computer with Sony MDR-V150 headphones and it sounds great. There is a lot of energy coming from the songs on this DVD and you will find yourself tapping your feet a lot. If I were at home and wanted to listen to something fun over the home stereo, this would definitely find it's way into the entertainment system."
1,I have more of a question then a review.,"I do like having the series on dvd dispite the music being missing. That being said, does anyone know the name of the song at the end of the dye dye my darling episode that replaced the original? I just like the song, and I've been trying to find it."
1,Very Good Radio,"This is a very good portable radio. It is very good if you hate turning the dial on the other portable radios. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars cause I thought that the headphones where not of the best quality. If you get this product, I would get some new headphones. You hear a lot of static with them."
1,Andy Griffith--a real actor/gentleman,"Very very informative, using the viable sources available, he did a very good job. I wish Andy Griffith himself would haveeither given his blessing or with held it, but recognizing the privacy of this very very talented actor, I think the author did a thorough job."
0,No more Southwestern Bell Phones for me...,I totally regret this purchase. I bought this phone less than a month ago and it has already stopped working...one day nothing! It wasn't very good from the beginning. Stupid me forgot to keep the receipt and box. Guess I'll stomp on it like the other guy did.
0,Alborada - Placido's or Soap Opera Soundtrack?,"Totally disapointed, the novela has stunning and beautiful melodies that are not included in this CD (I'm so mad), what is doing the others Placido's songs in this CD anyways? Jorge Avendaño should have included the other songs used in the novela, since the Antonio's and Juana's melodies to the songs used by the lady that sung in the castle's parties."
0,Bummer,The ink is awful!! Plan to buy refill ink immediately. The stamp shows up so light on the paper it's really hard to even see it. The stamps themselves are adorable and the only reason we didn't return it!
0,Sometimes humour just doesnt translate,"John Kennedy Toole is a fine sophisticated writer of that there is no doubt. His turn of phrase is descriptive and vivid and his clarity of expression is a pleasure to read. His Pulitzer prize was earned and deserved in my opinion. However, sometimes humour and other charactistics of story telling, which is what this book definitely is, just don't cross borders. While I could appreciate the talent of the writer in an abstract manner, the story did nothing to entertain me. I was basically left unsatisfied and rather replused by much of the story, due, I am sure, to the inability of a non-american to relate to a very colloquial and private joke."
1,Love these books,I have quite a few of the Tarzan books and they are such a fun read. You have to get use to the fact that these are not like the Tarzan movies but once you get past the fact that Tarzan is just as much at home going to the opera as he is living in the jungle then you can sit back and have a good read.
1,would purchase from seller again,This book came in better shape and was much cheaper than was offered at the University Bookstore. It came very quickly and packaged well.
1,wings,"This selected collection of stories is as exquisite, exhilerating, excellent, ephemeral-yet-eternal as genus Miller Moth's fluttering wings. Unique."
1,I would love to be marooned with these guys!!,"This CD has just about everything for a Barenaked Ladies lover. It has the commonly heard on the radio tunes like Pinch Me, Falling for the First Time, and Too Little Too Late. And some great new ones that express funny, serious and what were they on when they wrote this. As much as I want to describe the greatness of each song, I won't since there is no way to do that without exploding from finding that one word that isn't in the English language. They are great, funny, smart people who need to keep writing great songs like these! I urge you (did you say urge?) to buy this CD and bask in all that is the brilliant Barenaked Ladies!"
1,Awesome!,I loved looking through the pictures in this book. It took me a while to get through all of them. I'm reading other Beatle bio books and it is nice to have this to go along with them and be able to look through photos and timelines.
1,I love the RDS,"This little FM transmitter works great for me. I love the RDS feature that puts the band and song name on my car stereo. I am terrible at remembering names like these. So that feature is perfect for me.I like the on screen transmitter frequency control. I get great reception in my area. When going to bigger metro areas, I have to change channels and the three select buttons plus the ability to adjust with a simple click makes it easy to find a clear space.The only problem is the lighter socket of my truck was a little shallow for the Kensington and it didn't want to hold a connection. I use a power splitter to be able to connect a phone charger and never have issues.This is my first iPod transmitter and I have been super pleased with it."
0,The projector does not work as advertised!,"We were VERY dissapointed with the quality of this product, the picture from the projector is extrememly blurry. This is not a good use of money and had we not lost some of the ""movie disks"" we would have taken it back for a refund!"

0,EXTREMELY POOR QUALITY (SINGES FROM HOT OVEN),"PROS: Large mitt size with good wrist and lower arm protection.CONS: Poor quality cheap outer fabric, not inexpensive given only 1 mitt is included.WOULD I BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN: No!REASONS: In the first week of use, I picked up a very hot metal tray from the oven broiler and the outer fabric on the mitt thumb singed (burning a small hole in the outer fabric exposing the inner layer of insulation material. Later in the first month of use, the same happened a second time only worse - the hot pan burned and blackened a hole the size of a half-dollar (I had to open the sliding glass door to outside to clear the smoke out of the kitchen. Maybe next winter I will use what is left of these on a snowman...CAUTION: I did not notice when ordering that only ONE mitt is included (if you want a pair you need to order 2)."
0,ICK!,"Ok, this book was positively wretched! I hated it! I'm not trying to be rude, but it was completely different from the movie, and on top of that, they made the characters seem like dorks! I mean, they turned my beautiful spot to a freckle faced red head! How can you possibly like a book that isn't anything at all like the movie! Not to mention, they told us what really happened! I didn't want to know that they actually lost, nor did I want to know that Spot Conlon didnt' really exist, or did i want to know that most of the characters didn't exist either!"
1,Great read!,"I checked this book out from the library, but would definitely buy this for someone who needed an uplift. I couldn't put the book down. This book is worth its weight in gold. I loved it."
0,BLATANT FALSE ADVERTISING in the store!,"I picked this up at a Toys-R-Us store. There was no size indicated on the box, other than a picture of a boy sitting on a very LARGE ball. The age was for 3 and up.I opened the box on my son's birthday and much to my dismay saw that this ball is 15"" max! I have an average size 4 year old, and this ball is WAY TOO SMALL for him!The picture on the box is so blatantly FAKE AND MISLEADING!!! I am VERY angry! No child is small enough for this ""toy"""
0,stay away,i thought this would be good but wasnt sure it would work and it wasnt good and it didnt work i love metallica and im into rap but this wasnt rap just a bad singer and bad musicians stay away from this noise
0,did not help me,"this book is not helpful at all,its hard to follow,index and content not well organized,information inside of it is not useful,rationales and nursing intervention are lazily written .i ended up going back to using the internet as a form of patient research.at least i got it for cheaps"
0,Do not buy!!!,"Bought these for my Bostitch framing nail gun. Nail gun was purchased earlier this year for some home improvement projects. Two problems with these nails. First they do not advance with two clips properly. Have to pull back the lever every so often to make the nails advance. Not a problem until your 30 feet in the air trying to nail something and it misfires. So have to use one clip of nails at a time, what a pain when you are installing plywood or OSB (still does not adavance every time). Just the other day I had a nail jam in my gun, took over 30 minutes to fix. Long story short switched brand of nails to BC & Eagle. What a difference, no jams and can use multiple clips!!! Do not buy these, you would think Bostitch nails would work with their framing nailer??? Plus come on amazon, you shipped these without an extra box, half the clips are falling apart due to shipment. Noticed someone else complain about this????"
1,Coen Brothers,"Coen Brother's film, what more needs to be said. These guys are remarkable at capturing a area's culture, dialect and humor."
1,My Favorite Children's Story,"My dad read this book to me when I was growing up. It's always been my favorite. Now I read it to my son. It's definitely not a politically correct book but it's perfect for any small intelligent, insatiably curious member of a rather non-P-C family. =)"
1,Refreshing Illustrations for a Plastics Text,The illustrations in this book are clearly its greatest strength. The illustrator does a fabulous job of taking complex ideas and technical text and making them clear using enlightening 3D diagrams.
1,Fantastic grip on reality,"Faulkner's use of the stream of conciousness allows the reader to get into, not only the lives of his memorable characters, but their thoughts, their dreams, and their souls. In the Compsons, Faulkner has craeted a family not soon forgotten. It is not a family to be admired and their circumstances should be avoided at all costs, but the Compson family is very easily identified with. The book draws the reader into the thoughts of the dying South and all that the ""South"" entails. The book is a challenge but gets pleasantly simple after the first two books. Faulkner's style either gets clearer or you as the reader become more accustomed to the style. Either way, the book is truely a classic that I would recommend to any of my friends."
1,Very Great Spooky Thriller,"I watch this movie practically every night. For two main reasons, first because Kiefer Sutherland is in it and second because I love thrills, chills and horror in movies. This movie was very creative when it comes to mirrors. I give it two thumbs up. The movie really opens up in a thrilling chilling scene where the prior security guard Kiefer will be replacing is running is the NYC subway station in Harlem from something creepy and winds up hiding in a locker room where he finds a small window which he hopes to escape through but to his ""Oh F***!"" surprise when he opens it he finds it is bricked up and he cannot get out. Being he has hit a dead end he turns around, apologizes to the mirrors and suffers the unthinkably brutal fate in store for him by the mirrors. And here is where the terrifying story opens! Watch on and enjoy!"
1,Feel The grit in your teeth,All that I can really say about anything by The Sand is that you can feel the desert rolling in like waves on the ocean.
0,Poor Quality TV Broadcast,"You know this DVD sounds too good to be true...and sure enough it is. The videos are all ""licensed"" from somewhere overseas where they were originally used on a Make or Break It type program. Most of the videos are of marginal quality and nearly all have program logos and other writing on the screen. Not usable at all for my purposes."
0,Cheap and too heavy,Too heavy and cheaply made! It has 3 different parts and you cannot move it or all the water comes out!!!
1,awesome,"I love this book. I have read it hundreds of times. Let me just say that I love the social issues addressed and as someone who loved Beatrix Potter as a child, she would be so proud to have been a part of this work. So cleverly told, and so well done. His depiction of the Lake District is also spot on. Everything about this book is so organic and real. You feel like you can see yourself in all of the main characters. Ellen is one of my literary heroes."
1,Multi disc player,This Pioneer is exactly as the specs suggest and a real deal for such a unique Pioneer mult disc changer!!!!!
1,THE Horror Classic,"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of the best and most influential horror videos of all time. Though this film does not get enough recognition, it is one of the best flicks out there on the market in the horror genre. The only room for improvement on this video would have been more detail in the murder scenes for those like me who are partiallly desensitized, and need more for optimal enjoyment of a ""slasher"" flick. If there is any horror ""fan"" out there that has not seen this film, then he or she is not a true fan of the art of horror videos. I reccomend The Texas Chainsaw Massacre to even those who are not fans of the genre, for it is pure greatness."
0,Hard To Follow,"I found this book hard to follow. The author put a lot of effort into trying to make this an easy book. There are 79 hand pictures of the basic hand claps with the movements described in words, but I just can't get it. Music notes are included for each rhyme. I wish the author would have included rhythym as well. I have yet to use it with my students."
0,"oh my, this is really bad","overacting, non-acting, poor script, just some of the problems with this ""movie"". i'll probably end up trashing the disc and reusing the case. it's really bad."
0,Could Be Better,"I bought this DVD awhile back and was a little disappointed - the concert was mostly very dark and you really could not see much. In addition Geddy Lee's voice is now in poor shape, his vocals are nowhere near the qaulity of the original recordings on the albums. However there is alot of material here aside from the conceet to dwell on, for a true Rush fan this set is a must, but don't overexpect."
0,Honestly not very good..,"I like the books. At least the early books, and I'm an avid video gamer so when I saw they had a Left behind game, I decided to give it a whirl. First of all, even though my PC is up to spec, the game has REALLY long load times. The tutorial was beastly, the interface awkward. The units (people), look too similar, and have specific assigned genders (such as no female soldiers, etc.) Halfway through the monstrously long and unweildy tutorial I gave up. The graphics and the clunky iterface just didn't do it for me.I think this series would make a better adventure game... You know with puzzles and traveling to exotic locations (like those produced by DreamCatcher) The LB universe is so interesting it would really shine in that kind of environment. Particularly if characters could visit places such as Jerusalem, New Babylon, and Tribulation force HQ.The one plus to this game was the soundtrack. It was beautiful."
0,Made my problems worse!,"My son is post colicky so this book was not helpful at all to me. He showed no sleepy signs due to being chronically overtired. He cried MORE often and for longer durations after implementing most/all of the books suggestions and got up even more during the night! This book is best for those who nurse and co-sleep, and are willing to be up nights for months on end. It obviously worked for many, but not me! I found that it made all my son's problems worse which were only cleared up after implementing the steps from ""Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child."" My son is napping pretty regularly now after only a couple of weeks, and his disposition is markedly improving! He went from being up 2 or 3 times a night to sleeping 12 hours straight!!!!!!!! AND with LESS crying IF ANY! ""No-Cry"" is NO GOOD for me."
0,Ruth needs a break,"It's not that I didn't enjoy reading this book or most of it. Ozick is a interesting writer with a unique style which I liked but the story was incredible depressing. This idealistic lawyer (Ruth Puttermesser) is put through so much disappointment and misery,(to what end I can not fathom), it seems she is attacked at every turn. Even her dreams/fantasies destoy her. It was that ending that took this book from 4 or 5 stars to 2. I really don't need books to have happy endings but Ozick truly but Ruth through Hell. I don't think it was fitting and it damaged the whole story for me. Let hope Ozick life is better than Ruth's."
0,little pricey,"this would be an okay starter, if you don't know anything about 'explorer tools'but I'd have a hard time saying it's worth a whoppin' twenty dollars(!)worth of use for just one shopper..."
1,I love this band so much,"Counterfit is so awesome. if you ever get the chance to see them live, it's totally worth it. besides being absolutely entertaining live, counterfit also has a really great album. New Year is my favorite song, but all the songs are really good. if you have the cash to get this cd, do it, because it's well worth the money. they have really meaningful lyrics, excellent guitar and are just really well put together. GET THE CD!"
0,Sent wrong book and didn't even have book I ordered in stock,I ordered this book as a gift. It took about a month to come and when it arrived they had sent the wrong book. After I contacted the seller they finally replied to say they did not even have the book I ordered in stock. Very disappointing.
0,MAGIX PIANO & KEYBOARD WORKSHOP 2ND EDITION,"THE RATING FOR THIS PROGRAM IS ZERO STARS. I CALLED CUSTOMER SERVICE AND WAS PUT OFF WITH NO REPLY MY HOME PHONE IS 703 685 4935. WHEN I TRIED TO MAKE A BACKUP DISC MY COMPUTER SAID THAT THERE ARE ERRORS ON THE DISK. THE SAME RESPONSE WITH TWO DIFFERENT COMPUTERS. I WASTED TWO BLANK CDs. I WANT A PROGRAM DISK WITH NO ERRORS. MICROSOFT SAID THAT IT DOES NOT RECOGNISE ANY OF THE ""E"" MAIL ADDRESSES I COPIED FROM THE INSTRUCTION BOOK. THE PROGRAM HANGS UP ON WINDOWS 98. IT MAY BE DUE TO THE ERRORS ON THE DISK REPORTED WHEN TRYING TO MAKE A BACKUP. NOT BEING ABLE TO CONTACT THE MANUFACTURER IS NOT HELPFUL. THE OTHER THREE PROGRAMS I BOUGHT FROM AMAZON ARE ALL WORTH FIVE STARS BUT I REGRET HAVING BOUGHT THE MAGIX PROGRAM."
1,Great condition for such an old book!,"I ordered this book for my father. We were talking on the phone one night and he asked me if I knew where I could get this book. While we were talking I checked Amazon and found it immediately. The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars was because I ordered it for my Dad. This book was printed in 1933 and in such great shape, as it was advertised."
1,Felt like revisiting my childhood!!,"I absolutely LOVED Party of Five when it was on TV, the characters were great and the storylines were gripping and for the time hard hitting.Party of Five isn't avaliable in England so to be able to buy this and relive all my favourite characters is fantastic. I can't wait for the other Seasons to be released on DVD so that I REALLY can feel like a teenager again!!I would recommend everyone who loved this TV show to go out and buy this DVD, it's nicely packaged and although there aren't many Bonus Features on it the show itself makes up for it."
0,TERRIBLE phone!,"This phone has been a nightmare from day one. I had to return the first one I bought because the handset often refused to turn on and the answering machine was acting up. The second phone was good for about a month, then the battery refused to charge all the way, the sound quality became horrible, and the phone began cutting out on me frequently. If I sit right next to the base, turn off my fan and do not move an inch when talking, sometimes I can hear a caller through an entire phone call. On long calls I often have to hang up (or I get involuntarily cut off) and call back in order to try and clear background noise and static. The answering machine ocassionally blurts out ""Please leave a message"" of it's own accord--creepy late at night. I will NEVER buy another ATT phone again!"
0,Say what!,"I read the book and feel it can be summarized as follows: ""Think good thoughts and direct them at your navel. Sit up straight when you do so. Be careful, your navel is going to just burn up with energy. This energy is good for you."" And it says this over and over again in 193 pages. Clearly I'm missing something (I hope). I'm relying on other readers to clarify what I missed."
0,Total Rubbish,Very dissapointing DVD - had great expectations given the cast - the storyline and manner in which it was directed was dismally poor - do not buy this film!
0,Bored Out of My Gourd,"This was all plots and plans and no action. While it might have pictured what life was actually like in the Boleyn/Howard family, there was no action to it -- and I know that ""plots and plans"" can actually make a decent book, because ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" proves it!Thankfully, I didn't buy this book alone (I bought it at the same time I bought ""The Queen's Fool""), or I would've discounted Ms. Gregory as a truly boring author altogether. Hopefully, this book was just a fluke and her others (like ""The Constant Princess"" and ""The Virgin's Lover"") are just as good as ""The Queen's Fool""."
0,NOT CHRISTIAN FICTION,How did this series get on the Christian Fiction list? Which is what I always pull up when I'm shopping for books. So I tho't nothing of ordering them. They are not Christian books and I think you should remove them from that list.
0,Inquisition...,"If batteries had been around during the inquisition, the Sonicare Essence would have been a prime instrument of torture! The nerve sensation in my gums, plus the high pitch noise, combined to make me feel like my brains were being fried."
1,Other Side of the Bidge by Mary Lawson,"The book came fairly quickly and as was expected. I truely enjoyed reading the book for my Page-Turner Book Club in the Chattanooga, TN area. Thanks."
1,Favorite Book Of The Series,"This has been my favorite of the Dark Age series. The story follows Clan Jade Falcon and their descant (invasion) into the Inner Sphere. A good bit of background into the Battletech/Mechwarrior universe makes this a much better read and I found myself checking the mechwarrior wiki page for context.I found the political intrigue of the 'heroic' defenders interesting and the conflicting views of the Jade Falcon leaders Malvina and Aleks very griping as well.The psychology of leadership and warfare comes out in the two leaders. Action Adventure novels tend to glorify war but Victor Milan did a good job describing it as what it is: brutal, ugly, and painful. . . But can also be honorable and just.Five Stars"
1,Performs exactly as described.,"This item performs exactly as was described in any of the marketing information I read. That, in and of itself, is something to be happy about. Keeps coffee hot up to 36 hours, is easy to disassemble and clean, and the Stainless Steel is well worth the extra $$. The last one I had was aluminum, and it became dulled and dirty looking over time. This one looks new all the time."
1,A cool retro microphone,"I recommend the whole kit, with C01U USB studio condenser microphone, desktop stand and carrying case.Fidelity is top notch, although I am still working on ideal volume settings and microphone placement since the recording levels are on the soft side at present. But I have been able to adjust with no distortion for my recording projects.Can't wait to take it ""on the road."""
1,Italmodern Gracy Leather Chair,"I took a chance and bought these chairs based on just the picture and the few reviews. I must tell you that these chairs are very sleek. They are well constructed and are very sturdy. The packaging was outstanding and all parts were included.I would like to get another pair of these, but it looks like they only come in sets of four. Great find and I am very pleased!"
1,Space is the Place for Ace,"Shooting for the stars, this September 1978 solo release from KISS lead guitarist Ace Frehley delivers a strong effort which has a great mix of pop and rock.The snappy New York Groove was a worthy single and it reached #13 on the Billboard chart, with I Was Made For Lovin' You peaking two slots higher. The album scored platinum sales status and made it to #26 on the Billboard chart.The studio band is essentially Frehley - guitars, bass, vocals and guitar synthesizer - and drummer Anton Fig, with bassist Will Lee appearing on three numbers. By keeping the musical framework simple, Frehley achieved a higher orbit than his other band members who issued solo efforts at this time."
1,"Works well, but antenna cable is a little short...","Bought it for a 2nd computer that is on the other side of the house (100 feet or so). Used the drivers provided (running WinXP Pro). Usually has 3-4 bars (out of 4) of reception, has not caused a reboot that I know of (system is not on for long spans of time). The only problem is that the cable does not allow me to place the antenna on top of the CPU case (full-sized desktop case).Overall, a very good rating."
0,company problems,"I ordered this product as a replacement for one had broken. I received the order in good time, but it didn't work. I sent it back and the lady told me that she would open the next one, make sure that it worked, and send me a replacement. However, a couple of weeks later, I got notice that I was receiving a refund! Luckily, I was able to obtain a Palm Z22 without them."
0,Not 8X Compliant,These disks are NOT 8X compliant with the LITE-ON 8X DVD Dual Layer drive. Chances are they aren't compliant with any DVD recorder - they will only record at 4x speed. The label on the inner circle of the DVD clearly indicates 8X in the DVD write speed.
0,Waste of Money,"This wrap is poorly sewn together. We had only used this a couple of times before the seams started coming apart. If I wanted to sew, I would filled a tube sock with rice and seam the top. Poor quality."
0,This one plays fast and loose with history...,"...but remains entertaining. We had just seen ""Iron Man"" at the theater earlier in the day (a phenomenal film) and were still in a movie mood, so we dropped by Blockbuster to see what was out.""The Last Legion"" caught our eye and seemed right for our mood so we took a shot.While I winced at the references to ""the gods"" (at the time this film was ostensibly taking place - 432 A.D. - the Holy Church of Rome was well established) this film was still fun and shot beautifully. I felt like my eyeballs would pop at it's sumptuousness, as it looks that good on an HDTV.I'd give it two and a half stars if I could figure out how to get half a star to light up on Amazon's rating system.While it's no ""Troy - Director's Cut"", ""The Last Legion"" isn't wasted time."
1,A great resource,"James Robinson is a tremendously well-versed and insightful theologian. I am currently pursuing a PhD in Theology, so I've read a lot of his material - as well as those from other theologians. Robinson does a masterful job presenting some rather challenging concepts regarding Q. Though not comprehensive, this book is a ""must have"" for any serious scholar-wanna-be (like me) or others who are honestly interested in learning more about ""the greatest story ever told""!"
0,Does this guy have Tourette's about illicit sex and drugs?,"It takes a white to get going--and then doesn't. This is the third book I've read of Tropper's and while there is a degree of sex and drugs in his other books, this one is only about teenage sex and pot (despite any claims to the contrary). It's quite egregious. I'm not a prude but there's only so much you can take and then it's just a bad joke--pointless, embarrassing and boring. I couldn't even finish the thing."
0,wrong order,"i received the order on sept. 12, 2005, and it was the wrong book, and i still haven't received a refund for their mistake."
0,Boring,"After reading the other two bio's on melissa, I couldn't wait for her to write her own. I was very disappointed. When mentioning her band she completely leaves out Dave Beyer. Talk about a slap in a the face for him. I thought she would have a least put in more stories of being on the road instead of rehashing old interviews. Bascially I'm sorry I wasted my money. Don't get me wrong I'm a major Melissa fan. I just thought the book [stunk]."
0,This movie is a bad as it gets,"I can't believe Hollywood would make such a film as Freaked. It should be called ""Boring"", and a waste of time and money.Their is no plot, and it just rambles along. The Attack of the Killer Tomatoes at least had some suspense to it. Despite the big name actors in this --it goes nowhere. If you like movies made for celebral pygmies then maybe you like Freaked."
0,Colon Cleanser,"These taste exactly like the regularly sweetened gummy bears, however one main difference is the nuclear armageddon it does on your digestive system, they taste great going in, but you'll regret it in a matter of hours, even if you only eat a few, I ate 20 tops, and here I am running to the bathroom..."
1,Almost perfect CD Alarm Clock Radio with Digital Tuner,"The alarm clock is great. You can set up to 3 different times for the alarms to go off 1 utilizing the radio, 1 the cd player and 1 the buzzer. The only thing I have found to be quite annoying with it is that the cd alarm function is quite limited. You set a track to play off the cd you have and it will play that track and only that track to wake you up unless you change it. Additionally, when you press snooze it turns it off rather than say pausing it so if you are like me and hit snooze one or two times before waking, it keeps playing the beginning of the one track you selected so instead of pausing the song so you don't hear the same 30 seconds of the intro to the song EVERY time the alarm goes off. Other than that I love it, especially on the weekends when my husband or I have to go to work and the other doesn't or one needs to get up at a different time than the other, you don't need to worry about resetting the alarm time!!!!"
1,Interesting story,I enjoyed listening to my daughter read this story. It is exciting and we both enjoyed the storyline. We patiently awaited each day we read this story to find out what the next mysterious adventure would take us. Great story.
0,This CD is a worn out LP transfered to CD...,They took the audio from a worn out record and then tried to clean up it with digital noise suppression. It leaves the whole CD sounding murky and without any life whatsoever. It's unfortunate that all the intrusive noise reduction artifacts make this CD an unpleasant listen. It could've been a cool experience.I wonder what happened to the original tapes? Couldn't they even find a copy or safety somewhere? Unfortunate.
0,Good while it lasted...,"I got this as a Christmas gift from some friends after my last DVD player gave up it's ghost. It's now July...about 7 months later...and this player is dead already. It was fine up until a week ago, where you had to open/close the DVD tray several times to make it read a DVD. Now it won't recognize any disc at all. Sure, it's cheap...but only lasting half a year is still too short for any kind of product to be considered a good buy - at least in my opinion."
1,Wished I could read Hebrew,very interesting translation and background information. I love this text. It is so sensual. You feel like you are a spectator of all happenings.
0,Suffers from an over-simplified worldview,"Originally published in 1973, ""Dominion Over Demons"" spells out Maxwell Whyte's arguments in defense of exorcism, but he makes the statement that ""every accident, misfortune, quarrel, sickness, disease, and unhappiness is the DIRECT result of the individual work of one or more wicked spirits."" In other words, White's book appears to promote the use of ""The Devil made me do it"" as an all-purpose cop-out. Still, this book is an interesting research tool for those who study exorcism/deliverance ministry in that it is one of the earlier books in the modern-day deliverance movement."
1,As advertised,Product came as advertised and so far so good. I wear size 9 shoes and are just a little bigger then my shoes which makes them actually just right.
0,This isn't needed on most items.,Only get this if you have 7 year old kids that break everything or want to waste money
0,Didn't last very long,"On the second, use the machine hung up on an ice cube and sounded like it stripped the gears. Trying again after removing the ice cube gave the same result except quicker.Wonder what the ""Bonus"" was supposed to be. Didn't get anything but the Ice Shaver.I will be returning this item."
1,Modern Aesops Story,This is an impressive and fun to read book. It offers children a terrific opportunity to sharpen critical thinking skills while empowering their interest in politics. Absolutely wonderful; My twin girls loved it. I also bought a copy for my local public library. There is currently a waiting list to check it out.
1,Great headgear,Helmet fits my sons head with no problem. Product seems to be durable he has not had any accidents to test that part. It seems like any other helmet that would be purchased at at store.
0,Bad Fit,"I purchased this and the Boppy Maternity Support Band at the same time - and I'm 31 weeks pregnant, with some ongoing feelings of thigh pain and belly pressure. For me, the mini cradle was ill-fitting, as many other reviewers have said. The largest hook-and-eye setting was just too large, and the medium setting was far too small. Additionally, the band was uncomfortable, and I was not able to find a position that worked for me.The Boppy band was much more supportive, and it's extra width helped lift my belly more evenly than the Mini Cradle, which put a lot of pressure on one area. I'm planning to return this product."
1,Works good,These fit perfectly under my vanity in the bathroom. They were easy to assemble but are not the most stable. I knew that purchasing them that a foldable laundry basket wouldn't be as strong as a non-foldable one. Full of clothes they are great bc it's not as flimsy. It fits about 1 week worth of clothes. I just wish they had darker colors bc I am hoping in time these don't get too dirty.
1,Amazing!,The talent shown on this album is unbelievable.There is an open space in my CD player for This Side when it comes out.
0,Trash,"If you liked ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" you'll hate this novel. This is a classic case of an author who stumbles upon a best seller, and the publishers quickly trot out all the writer's earlier bombs. This is a silly story of a sex crazed teenage girl who commits just about every crime in the book to hold onto the estate she loves but cannot inherit. This is the first of a trilogy, and reviews suggest books 2 and 3 are rewinds of the same basic idea. Ridiculous!--never would have read it except I had the flu."
0,"Empty out your garbage cans, folks...","It's too bad I ended up buying this before I read Steve's review below because this album really does bite. The only place this album stands a chance of being recognized is next to the Backstreet Boys or Green Day. Hell, Green Day is more entertaining than this crap! At least they can use speed and variety!"
0,Stone Angel,It was a dull and boring book that put me asleep while reading what was thought to be the most interesting parts of the book.
1,Excellent Reference Book,"I am the kind of person who likes to go direct to the point. This book offers an excellent way to learn HTMl,XHTML and CSS in a quick way. One does not have to go through an entire chapter to learn something"
0,From this day forward,From the editorial review the books sounds like blah to me. Nothing unique. So they had a good marriage. Great for them. Not worth the effort.
0,Stopped working,"I bought this charger because of the retractable cord and I thought it would be less bulky in my car. I used it periodically, maybe once or twice a week during my commute, and after 6 months, the device stopped charging. I thought it was my port but it was the charger as I bought a second charger from a local electronic store that worked but when I switched out chargers to this one, the phone would not charge. I have an iPhone now but this product cannot be recommended."
0,Problem in the table of contents,"Hey Guys,I'm enjoying using kindle so far. It has been great. Although this is the first book that gives me a headache.The table of contents has problems, you can not jump from one work to another.I already wrote to Amazon, they said that it has been fixed it, but so far the problem remains. I deleted the file, reseted my kindle and the file is still with problems. I even checked on kindle for PC and the problem is there as well.I hope this opinion might help to solve the problem, otherwise I will have to buy another version."
0,An Illogical Chain of reasoning,"When I read this book, I was amused by it. To say that the disorder in Africa benefits someone--e.g., via corruption--has been around for some time and is nothing new. To say that this disorder somehow makes the societies ""work"" is new but illogical. For something to ""work"" for the continent as a whole it must have positive net benefit. Right now, the disorder in Africa is such that the benefit to those who gain is far less than the loss to those who lose. This is a well-known research result. Africa doesn't work; the disorder results in a net loss to Africa. Why Africans do not do enough to change the institutional and organizational order is an interesting reasearch topic. How one can help Africans do something about this predicament is also an interesting research topic. But to say that the disorder works is illogical."
1,Kids love it,Bought Marine Mania and other ZT 2 expansion packs for my kids. They love it and told me Marine Mania is the best.
1,Great fan for small places.,I purchased two of these desktop fans for our RV. They work perfectly in confined space to move air. Extremely quiet which is great for a small bedroom area. Would highly recommend. Received both fans in perfect order and extremely quick. Would recommend seller and product.
1,A must!,"I've read this book in Polish so literary values of the English translations are not the point of my reflexion.I just wanted to say - this book will make yours eyes sweat...It never happened to me while reading. I just could not stop crying.No great classical novels have ever made me feel this way. This modest book appears in an era when writing a GREAT novel is wirtually impossible. We all know why, and we all agree. Of course - great novels can appear in the context of postmodern American Literature, but they don't necessarily make a great read.Schlink does it with his modesty and understatement.And one more thing: THIS BOOK IS NOT ABOUT HOLOCAUST. The author had chosen the Poles to be the victims in this book - please respect it. 3.000.000 Poles (besides another 3.000.000 Jewish citizens of Poland) died from German atrocities during WWII - and when one uses the word Holocaust it denies them the right to memory."
1,Smooth Operation,I didn't use the iron immediately because I was worried about the weight. However I did use it for the first time yesterday and the digital temperature is a great feature knowing exactly when the desired level of heat is reached. The surface of the sole plate is unbelievably smooth and the iron literally glides over the item. That alone is reason to buy this iron. It is so smooth that I didn't notice the 3.5 lbs. I would recommend this iron.
1,Good reading to learn about the amish,It was good reading and would be suitable for any age person to read it helped to learn about the amish way of life
0,DId not work for my Mac Pro,This mouse did not work well with my Mac Pro. Scroll wheel would stop for no reason. Mouse would not always track with the mouses movements. Replaced it within weeks
1,"Poorly-written, nonetheless extremely important and gutsy","This book is not very graceful. The prose is childish. Goldberg often uses profanity. And there is not much of a flow to the argument.However, I still think that this book is extremely important - and Bernard Goldberg is a very courageous man. It is true that the media is very arrogant and very tiltied to the left. We've all known it for years. Now, one of the insiders who has personal experience has confirmed what we've all known all along.The book offers a behind-the-scenes look at CBS News. It affords us an extremely important perspective on an important issue of our time. I would recommend it to anyone - conservative or liberal."
0,spend a little more...,"I bought this cd because I enjoyed the pianist's playing of the two chopin concertos, available on the Naxo's label. However, this recording in no way matches the artistry of lugansky, pollini, ashkenazy, or perahia. If someone is looking for a budget recording, berezovsky's is worth every penny and much more. The sound on Szekely's recording is marred by a murkiness, but it does not hide the pianist's wrong notes, which one would overlook in a live recording given the difficulty of the chopin etudes, and his hestiation to inhabit these works. Instead, these interpretations seem, like the recording, distant and unfocused. Save some money and spend a little more on the pollini, lugansky, perahia, or berezovsky."
0,Puerile and Ludicrous,"Can't anyone ever come up with a better conspiracy plot than at one extreme the government taking over and at the other capitalism? Give me a break! It's like a horror comic book spliced with a hard-core porn rag, meant to be shocking but ultimately laughable. But maybe if they could take an okay Stephen King story and concoct the * movie ""Maximum Overdrive,"" then maybe the reverse can happen here, but who'd bother?"
0,Could be Better,I don't think I listened to any track b4 track 9 more then a few times and that's where all the top notch rappers are.The only good songs would be big things and yes Sir.
1,Portable CD Player,Great little CD player with tape player and AM/FM Radio. The sound is very good quality and the CD and tape player work very well. Recommended.
1,Rich & developed,I love the depth & passion of the characters in their daily goings as well as the ramped-up love scenes.Believable & classic to Ms.Schulers writing style. Flawless~
0,Misleading,No indication what so ever that this is indeed a Belkin product. Identical to the the Cat 5E plugs I already have had. Otherwise smooth transaction and on time shipment
0,"Abrigdged, tiny book","Dang! Need to read the fine print! This is a tiny, abridged version. Get the whole book, not this whimpy thing."
0,Not too good,"What's up with Lonely Planet? Their new titles have been stinking for the last couple of years. This book wasn't very well researched. The Haiti section was very bare bones, and the Dominican Republic section was okay, but missed out on most of the best nightlife spots in Santo Domingo, some of the best beaches, didn't cover large sections of the country. I was really disappointed."
0,Bland popsters believe their own press clippings.,"...there are plenty of mediocre rock and country bands in the world and against all odds, Whiskeytown has joined their ranks. Pneumonia has 3 or 4 decent songs, but where is the rough edge and swagger of ""Stranger's Almanac"" and ""Faithless Street""??? Where is the heartfelt desperation and alcohol fueled raggedness, that give the band is uniqueness? There is some pleasant pop music on ""Pneumonia"" but what the Hell, you can get that from the Foo Fighters etc...I see a tuneless and hookless future, full of critical acclaim from people who never much cared for country music anyway."
1,The best is better,"I have been using the trackman wheel for what seems like forever and when I decided to streamline my computer system via wireless everything that I could, I was delighted that there was a wireless trackman. Had there not been one, my trackman wheel would have been my only wired connection because I would NEVER give up the wheel. It saved my shoulder from the damage the regular mouse was causing me. I definately recommend this product!"
0,Absolutely Horrible,The WORST item every purchased online. This really is very cheap - bad inkjet and looks like a high school project.Comes in a three-ring binder with page sleeves inside. READ THE REVIEWS!Will return immediately.
1,The Saving Graces,"The true test of a great book for me is 1.) I read it too late into the evening/early morning 2.) I can't want to share it with my mother,daughter, sister and best firend and 3.) I can't put the story out of my mind. The Saving Graces met all three criteria. Enjoy and share it with a friend."
0,Don't Bother!,If you're looking to fish in the Northeast...forget it. This book seems to focus in on two or three states for the most part. I was very disappointed with this directory. I expected more from Bass Pro Shop. Two thumbs down...save your time and money.
1,i couldn't put this book down.,a truly scary tale of the medical establishment gone very wrong. i hope i never get sick and need to go to the hospital again!
0,Uselessly Dim,"I purchased a few of these nightlights based on the ratings of others. Big mistake. If you are looking for a nightlight to replace any of the bulb variety you might be using now, forget about these. You will be greatly disappointed in comparison! These nightlights have a large bezel giving the impression they'll emit enough light, however the LED bulb is about 1/5 the height of the bezel and barely lights it's own cover, let alone a few inches around it. Run, don't walk from these. Stick with the incandescent bulb styles."
0,Shoddy Journalism,"Edward Klein is getting rich off of ""shoddy journalism."" Anyone who reads this book and takes the opinion that it's a good read or he did his homework and research on Hillary Clinton is a fool. It may contain entertainment purposes for some, but it's only pure garbage. The only reason why this book is selling is not because Edward Klein's name is on it, but because some writer's and journalists find it imperative to attack a woman who has a very good chance of being our first female American President; not to mention the huge profit factor involved for Klein and the publisher (s).I completely disagree with this book and the ""facts"" (if you can call them that) in this book. Poor writing, deceptive research, plagiarized and just an insult to anyone with an ounce of intelligence."
1,"Love it, again.","This is actually the second of this model of coffee pot that I have bought. I got the first one 7 years ago when they first hit the market. I used it almost every day and finally decided to replace it. The old one still worked great, it just had a small leak in it. Not bad for 7 years old. I knew that I had to find the same model again.It is so easy to operate and to clean. It brews a great pot of coffee.I also love the program feature. I get everything ready the night before and am greeted with a fresh pot of coffee when I step out of the shower each morning.I love it!!!"
0,the accidental book,"While I enjoyed some of the stories in this book, I couldn't really follow a coherent thread here. This book seemed a kind of fun and loose ramble through some of the authors musings on what is art. But it was way too loose for me and I can't say I came away from reading it with any really new thoughts or perspectives on what makes an 'Accidental Masterpiece' aside from the eccentric conviction of the creator. A mildly interesting perspective, but not exactly fresh or new or terribly insightful."
1,"Not a bad game, if you have the HD Space (850 megs)","Rustin Parr is a pretty alright game....Play it in the dark, at night, and I guarantee a scare... It does take up alot of hard disk space, though.... The whole game loads onto your hard drive, so do like I did....install it, take it back for a refund, and play til your heart's content...for free.. It is a pretty good game though....I never played nocturne....Overall, a game worth playing, especially if you are a Blair witch fan."
1,MURDER IN A MILL TOWN,LOVED THE SERIES. GREAT CHARACTERS AND LOVED READING ABOUT EARLY BOSTON. NELL SWEENEY IS A WOMAN AHEAD OF HER TIME. SHE IS BRIGHT AND INDEPENDENT WITH SECTRETS THAT ARE TOTALLY FORGIVABLE. I RECOMMEND READING THE ENTIRE SERIES. YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO RESIST
1,Incredible,"After listening to so many ambient artists and albums, Biosphere comes out on top with Substrata. The album captures that strange sense of being half awake and half asleep. Simply amazing."
0,Not worth buying,It is marketed as spicy and frankly it's not only not spicy but it's quite bland. I have fond memories of Buffalo Bills Shredded Jerky as a kid. This completely failed to meet my expectations.
1,Where Was It Really Recorded?,"In the other reviews, at least three writers claim the show that was recorded on this CD was in their town. Please let me set the record straight! Todd used sound effects records to create the audience noise, so I wonder what the other reviewers had for breakfast that day!If anyone saw Todd perform with ""A Walk Down Abbey Road"" this year, or last, they will know what he can do with a cover song.Many fans say ""Todd is Godd"", but personally, I am pushing for Saint-hood!"
0,Waste of time/money,"The techniques used were pretty old school and not so much for today's digital world. Majority of the pictures inside the book aren't impressive at all. The cover shot seems to be the best one but anyone can take that same picture with the right amount of light. I didn't learn anything I haven't already read online. Books on car photography are extremely limited, but even so I would not recommend reading this book. Read the other one by James Mann instead."
1,Best of Its Kind,"Of the 7 or so books on this topic I've bought on this topic, this is the best. The technique taught here - of trimming the edges before matching pieces - works better than what I'd tried to do from previous books. Furthermore, the designs are just down-right PRETTIER than those in most of the others. Patterns are a bit too small for my skill level, so I cheated by using a copy machine to ""enlarge"" slightly (125%). I'm absolutely delighted with the finished product."
1,A world we can't imagine,"As a mother myself, my heart broke reading this story of courage. Though the first chapter was more like a travel journal, the story became engrossing when grandmother's story took over. Though the writing is somewhat amatuerish at times, the story is none-the-less emotional and compelling. I learned a lot about life in Korea - a life we in America could not imagine. I heartily recommend this story of courage."
1,Haunting,"Unbreakable is not your fiery Bruce Willis actioneer and may be considered to be slow and brooding. If you like a movie that brings you into the all too everyday and mundane exsistence of a security guard and completely turn it upside down in suttle but errie ways. If you want to see Bruce play a realistic and memorable character in a film about the fantastic you will love this movie. Samuel L. Jackson is outstanding as a tragic art dealer who specializes in comic art, his character is named Elijah Price and will remind you of the mysterious people Vincent Price portrayed. Perhaps M.Night Shylaman was doing an off handed tribute to the late great Vincent. Robin Wright Penn and Spencer Treat Clark turn in great performances as well. This is the kind of movie you will not just watch once."
1,Insightful!,"This is a book very much in the tradition of Jack Schwager's Market Wizards. Like Schwager, author Michael Covel interviewed a number of great traders and attempted to capture the essence of each trader's approach to trading. The author does a good job of presenting the basics of trend following. Though much of what he says will come as no news to anyone who has read very widely in the literature of trading, his liberal quotations from other authors enliven what would otherwise be an uphill read. The author has a good eye for a snappy quote, and we believe that even if you buy this book only for the quotations, you will certainly get your money's worth. What you earn from following the trend masters' stock tips is entirely up to you."
0,Oh Dear...,"Yes this DVD has some new moves that you can use, but man it is incredibly boring. Sound, picture, cut, music, light, presentation etc. It leaves a lot to be wanted. It is NOT worth your money."
1,granddaughter's favorite,"My 16 mth old granddaughter loves this book. I don""t know what it is about it. It's not my favorite, but kids really seem drawn to it. I've given it as gifts and it's always well received. My granddaughter wants it read to her first, then she goes back thru it and looks at all the pictures again. I will be buying the other book in the series for her."
1,A good buy for Soundgarden fans. Not so much for non-fans.,"This is some good music. It is much more stripped-down than their later stuff, but the songwriting is still strong. The song quality is inconsistent, though. Very raw, it probably wont appeal to most people."
1,Wow! I didn't know that stuff,"What an interesting book. Lots of information. Very well written, very readable, and when I have time, doable."
1,Happy New Discovery,"It is always a delight to discover a wonderful new series, and Charlene Harris' Sookie Stackhouse books definitely fall into this category. She herself is fun to be with, as are those around her. Strange creatures abound, wackiness ensues, and fun is had by all, especially the reader."
1,"Works, easy to use","I used these to hook up speakers to a receiver. They are easy to use, and so far have proven quite durable."
0,Save your money.,"I was really excited with this purchase, but the seat strap didn't even last through one full rehearsal. Broke within the first hour! The metal clasp is just too weak to support the full weight of the bassoon."
0,"If you hate miso soup, this product may be for you!","I love me some miso soup.A good miso soup is a subtle combination of flavors(onion, broth, tofu, seaweed), but all I could taste when eating this product was the plastic bag the noodles came in. (And yes, I did remove the packaging before consuming the soup) I had low expectations for this soup and it managed to fall very short of them. Fortunately, a few dashes of soy, squirts of Sriracha, and squeezes of lime allowed me to pinch my nose and pour the stuff down my throat.So, if you hate miso soup, and have a hankerin' for a plasticky aftertaste, Annie Chun's Miso Soup Bowl might just be your ticket to paradise."
0,Horribly uncomfortable,"The underwires on both sides of the bra hve poked through the fabric, and the bare metal stabs like a knife. Very disappointing. I usually like Olga braa, but not this one."
1,Lee Morgan In Top Form Here,"Lee Morgan is in top form here displaying his trademark soulful sound and harmonically intriguing lines. Check out his full, round, fat (phat, too!) sound on the opening tune -- he stays very much in the lower/middle register and just plain swings. Jackie McLean is a perfect compliment to Lee and the rhythm section including the great Billie Higgins is cookin' up a storm. The ending tune, (a 24-bar blues, is one of Lee's great solos on record I think! Also check out the opening measures of Lee's solo on Miss Nettie B.! It doesn't get any better than that!"
1,great,es una excelente cancion. Una excelente calidad de audio y excelente composicion artistica. Viva el Rock! Recomiendo esta cancion siempre
0,Good Eye Candy...but NOT A WORKOUT,"I give this one star strictly for the eyecandy and nothing else. Don't waste your money if you're looking for a workout video. What cuiing there is, is lousy. The only thing that may come close is the stretching in the beginning. This is definitely NOT a workout video. If you want eye candy, fine, but don't expect much else."
0,not happy,"Took it out of box, put on table, did not turn, picked it up and litttle black pieces came off. Not happy."
0,GLUG GLUG GLUG,"Nice humidifier, UNTIL you need to keep your baby asleep while the thing makes this absolutely ridiculous glugging noise throughout the night (even on the low setting!!) -- woke our baby up, woke us up, 7AM I'm putting this thing back into its box (which was already in the recycle bin) and back to the store. Bought one of the Crane humidifiers (the frog) and it works beautifully and most importantly - SILENTLY."
1,you have earned another customer!,"The movie came, it was not scratched, Still wraped up.. you never know when you order stuff online what your gonna get I gave them a 5 star"
0,"Difficult to start, expensive refills","Need I say more? Starting the ""sausages"" was really hard and they ended up just getting into a big lump. With a newborn you go through so many diapers you end up using about 1-2 refills a week and I couldn't afford that with everything else a newborn needs. When it did start ok it did keep the smell minimal. Oh, there also wasn't anywhere to put wipes after you closed the diaper up and put it in the thing so you end up putting it in the trash where it smells...If you have the time and energy to change the refills at 2am then go for it. My experience is you either love it or hate it. I hate it."
0,What was I thinking?,"I read this book, because it was there in front of me. Pls do not do it. It is very boring and predictable. You will spend most of your time reading in circles....I gave it 1 star for two reasons, I cannot give it less and it always sent me right to sleep....."
1,"Really good game, very fun","I thought this was a cool game when I first played it. You can make cool sound effects go with the scenery, have Disney characters judge your ride and ride actual roller coasters from Disneyland. I just wish that there was:1. More Toontown and Frontierland scenery2. More lands to build your rides on3. Bigger spaces to build your ridesand 4. Some way to build a pond so you wouldn't have to put boats on dry land.What I DO like about it is:1. You can ride your ride or other rides2. Great sound effects3. Great graphics4. It's addictive!!I also liked the ""Flying"" coaster, which makes it look like you are soaring through the air without any supports. I also like that some scenery will activate(blow up, burn ect.) or make sound effects as you ride past.Ultimate Ride Coaster: Disney Edition is a great family game with no horrible violence that other games have. Buy today!"
0,Usually a great Patterson fan.,"The best thing about this book is it's length. With very short chapters of 2 to 3 pages and half empty pages at the beginning and end of these chapters to stretch it out, this book is a very fast read. It is not your usual Patterson. It lacks everything that is usually found in his books. I did read it all the way through hoping that it would improve as it progressed. This did not happen. All the characters seemed to be shallow and unlikeable and the plot strange because key points such as the plagues of illnesses were unexplained and vague. The ending seemed to be condradictory-if the Devil's child survived the drowning, why did the plagues end? And who found him and raised him with no publicity? Surely a new born baby saved from the ocean would make headlines even in the Irish countryside."
0,Eh not as good as you would think,Ok so I was excited to see this movie.. I thought wow a good actress is in it.. That's a bad sign.. I find sometimes horror movies with unknown actors are better..So the beginning is good. The blonde leader kid is good. Creepy. BUT then it starts getting DUMB. So the whole egg scene is bizzare. I dont wanna give away too much but she's just stupid the second time she puts up with it..and WHY on earth didn't she tell her friends!!!!!!! CMON!Then I also thought she has knives in the kitchen she couldve grabbed one quick and sliced the guys! BUT NOOOOOOOO............Overall.. I was dissapointed. The ending was UGH.. I spent 5 bucks renting this and I wish I had waiting for it to be on HBO. You should all just wait. see no evil is a better flick!
1,Dusty rocks!,I have always loved Dusty and this discography is great. Wish it had more personal info but her recording career is well covered. A Dusty fan must have.
1,Excellent biography,Chester Alan Arthur and post Civil War politics are explained in very interesting manner. The drama of Arthur's assumption of the Presidency and then the steady Presidency. Arthur's transformation from machine politician to promoter of a Civil Service Reform told in a interesting informative style.
0,Stills is King,"Anybody that knows anything about music will tell you that Stephen Stills is the greatest guitarist that ever lived. Look his name up on the internet, any site will tell you this. Without him, there is no Crosby, Stills, and Nash. Although they are the best ever together. Stills is lead singer and guitarist"
1,Breathtaking and emotional,"I felt very emotional after viewing this video. It's hardly worth banning, and I think that everyone should view it. It shows poignantly what happens with a depressed, angry young person. I idolize Madonna for her ability to express what she wants without limitations, and for touching on the most sensitive subjects that most people shy away from. I think this video is very important to society and people who are open minded will be just as deeply touched as I was."
1,MES PLUS GRANDS SUCCES,"I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF FRANCK POURCEL FOR OVER 20 YEARS.IT IS A SHAME THAT THERE ARE A FEW CDS OF THIS GREAT CONDUCTOR.I HAVE MOST OF HIS ALBUMS ON RECORDS & TAPES.NO DOUBT,THIS ALBUM IS ONE OF HIS GREATEST PERFORMANCES."
1,Started a discussion,"I am part of a Catholic mens discussion group and Steve's Video has started a continuing discussion about the Church fathers. How could anyone deny that the Catholic Church was started by Jesus Himself after reading 2000 years of His teachings through Ignatius, Polycarp, and many many more."
1,Weigh To Go!,This is a great comedy. I really enjoyed it. It has a great storyline. I must warn you if you are overweight and don't have a sense of humor you may just find this movie offensive. But in the end it all makes sense.
1,please with lens,"very pleased with camera lens, very lightweight, easy for everyday use use and does not add much to total camera weight, downside is that it is mostly plastic and not as sturdy. Pleased with product, arrived timely"
0,not dvd-audio,"First, I've always like Teddy, the music itself is fine; but this disc is not dvd-audio. true dvd-audio is either 24bit 96MHZ 5.1 surround sound or 24 192MHZ 2 channel stereo.This disc has neither. Also you would need a dvd-audio player to be able to listen to the music. You can listen to this disc on any regular dvd player of cd player. It does have Dolby digital 5.1 and dts 5.1 tracks on the disc but that means any dvd player will play those tracks. I believe the disc is being misrepresented with the dvd-audio words on the cover of the disc I have received. Too bad! You live and learn form your mistakes. If I had know this ahead of time I would not have bought this disc. Thank you."
1,That's Whatta Danc'in About!,"Excellent old school disco mix! Feel's like the late 70's! If you like a continuous disco mix, you'll love this CD."
1,ONE OF THE BEST,I PLAYED THIS GAME ONCE....AND IT WAS OVER I'VE WANTED THIN GAME FOREVER IF YOU'VE HAD DOUBTS LIKE ME DON'T WORRY IT'S A GOOD GAMEEASY TO CONTROL & 5 STAR FUN FACTOR SO IF YOU WANT A SPORTS GAME NOT TO SERIOUS GET THIS YOU WONT BE SORRY!
0,Not a book for novices,"I had developed a web site using HTML 3.2 and a text editor and had no problem. But after buying GoLive5 and this book I was ready to chuck it all and go back to my text editor. The book will not show you how to create a website using GoLive. It will explain what everything does, but it doesn't show you how to use it. I found myself referring to the GoLive online help to understand the book. I finally gave up and purchased the SAMS Teach Yourself Adobe GoLive 5. A much better book for the beginning user and half the price. An experienced web designer might find Real World GoLive a good choice, but be prepared to wade through a lot of stuff to find what you need to know."
1,Sherlockian Delight,"Priceless memories. I may be a younger person than most fans of Sherlock Holmes, but I loved him nonetheless. House is the ""Joeseph Bell"" version of Holmes, The master diagnostician, not the detective. Hugh Laurie's comedic and dramatic abilities are put to the ultimate test, which he passes effortlessly. It's truly an unforgettable character and performance he put together. I got the second season too, and it only gets better. Extremely Highly Recommended. A must-own item."
0,Intellectual Dishonesty,"As a PhD student in the UK studying religion and American foreign policy, I was hoping to find in Diamond's book a thoughtful and well-researched account of the religious right in America. What I have just read is a piece of shock journalism. Diamond's intent throughout is to paint the religious right (which she defines so ambiguously that it is meaningless) as a monolith whose unified intention is to support murderous dictators and greedy multinationals - whenever and wherever possible. This book is an excellent example of how ""good"" research - when it is driven by intellectually dishonest aims - produces ""bad"" (distorted/unbalanced) ends."
0,Extremely bogus!!!,"Unfortunately, this online review system does not allow the selection of 0 (ZERO) stars...cause that's what this title gets from me...it's not worthy of even one star!!! All of the other evaluations are correct. This title is a total waste of DVD media...and is not worth $5 or even 5 cents!"
1,"Great book, especially for beginners","I was thinking about getting a parakeet so I bought this book and it taught me everything I ever wanted to know about what having a parakeet would entail. I did notice there was nothing about breeding parakeets, but as a new parakeet owner that is far from my top concern at this point. Everything in the book was pertinent to what I needed to know. There was a great chapter on setting up your home for the parakeet and everything you would need to get and how to make your home safe, as well as a chapter about all the different things you can feed your parakeet (including several easy recipes that your parakeet is guaranteed to enjoy!) There are too many parakeet owners out there who neglect their birds, and this book teaches you how to be a great owner instead. I know that when my hand-fed baby parakeet comes home with me in a few weeks the knowledge I gained from this book will make me a great budgie owner!"
1,Great Seris,"I can't not want until the next season is on DVD. I love Kelsey Grammer play the bad/crazy guy. Too bad, there won't be a 3rd season."
0,This Is Bad,"Please, believe me....this is terrible music. People seem to think that Roofie has some type of Tom Waits, Randy Newman thing going, but.....he doesn't. Oh god, this is very bad. My fiance (who usually has great taste) loves the song April Fools and has forced me on countless occasions to listen to Roof-Dog's inane stupidness. April Fools is a very bad, whiny, annoying song that seems to never end. It's still the best song on the album, though. He tinkers at the piano like some highschool new-age-folkie wannabe. The orchestrations are equally as bad. Worst of all, though, are the songs, which all sound the same. Save your money, time, and sanity."
0,Terrible,I can't believe Amazon charged for a preview. What a joke. This needs to be fixed. Absolutely a rip off.
1,Fantastic product!,Had no problem winding/unwinding my 100-foot 12/3 extension cord. I will definitely purchase another one for my other extension cord as well. I just can't believe I hadn't bought this product sooner!
1,These girls rock,I Think Total's sophomore album is totally different from the first one and I really didn't expect that huge of a change. But I must say that I like the change . These girls are really Bad . That's why we love them + this cd is very sexy with tracks like rock track or move too fast ( don't forget the slammin' interlude MASTURBATION) These girls are the baddest. Keep on with the sexy sound Kima keisha(my favorite) and Pam
1,"An uncompromising, simply rendered description of modern","...society in the late 1970's in London. The ""quartet"" is four older middle-class, working people, two women and two men around the age of sixty. They face the challenge of being without spouses or truly close relatives other than each other. Pym writes of the tragic circumstances of being condescended to by well-meaning, irritating young social workers who only seem to alienate these pensioners. Though the loneliness is obvious; its solution isn't sloppily described with a simple, conventional ending. I couldn't put it down."
0,Freezes on Windows XP,"The ""create a W2"" or ""Add a W2"" button doesn't work.. click on it and the program freezes -- every time! Even restarted the program, rebooted the computer... always freezes there. I am running it on a new, power computer and no other program has problem.Asked TurboTax, they asked me to work around it by switching to ""form mode"" (that is, they know this is a problem) and fill in the form instead. When asked if it's a bug, this tech support said ""There is no bug in turbotax that I know of"" !!!"
0,Terrible,"every single aspect of this movie was an embarrassment to the original muppet showterrible pace extremly rushed ending ""so cliche its not even funny"", the worst jokes ive ever heard in my life sing a longs that last for way to long characters with no like value what so ever!!!!!!!!!!!"
0,Extremely poor quality product.,"I have purchased and returned two sets of these headphones. The first set overheated and fried itself as soon as the batteries were installed. The second set worked for a little over an hour before developing constant hissing and popping. Also the head band adjuster would not retract on one side, making it impossible to fold them up for storage in the travel bag.I consider the quality of this headset one of the poorest I have ever seen. Even frayed bare wires were visible on one side.I recommend you avoid Taurus products completely."
1,Headline,i like because it is very fun for me and my friends. it is also very intertaining. lol lol ha ha
0,Gizmo that really works,"In mid-80s I had the original GE kitchen device - forerunner of this Gizmo - and it was used multi times daily. Perfect to whip a couple of eggs to scramble, small amount of icing for tops of cookies, mayonnaise and secret ingredients for homestyle Arby's sauce or other secret ingredients for world's best tartar sauce. When the tool died of old age I was unable to find replacement. Just stumbled on this online and am delighted to have my friend back in my kitchen. The company who supplied it did so promptly and economically. I am one happy old lady!Incidentally - this is new, improved model with swivel head for use as upright tool with the additional 'tool' for blending beverages in container. I made custard pie yesterday using Gizmo - we did good!"
0,Trashy,"I picked up this title based on the recommendation of a friend, and I have to say I was rather disappointed. I expected Ann Rice to be a virtuoso. She turned out to be a hack with an anal fixation. The dialogue and narration is only slightly better written than Penthouse letters, and the effect is less erotic. The only reason I rated the book as high as I did is because it read quickly, so at least I didn't waste a lot of time getting through it."
0,"Product ok, delivery just so-so","I ordered this product for my son's required reading. The price was very good but the shipping took the longest within the guidelines even though the seller stated that the book was available to ship out the same day, I received notice that it didn't ship out until many days later. When it finally arrived it was not in ""good"" condition; I would have rated it lower."
1,The Land They Possessed,"The book, THE LAND THEY POSSESSED, by Mary Worthy Brenneman was an alterante selection of the Literary Guild when it was first published in 1956. This is the reprint authorized and updated by the Germans from Russia Heritage Society in Bismarck, ND. It is a timeless story of the clash of cultures during the settling of the Great Plains. It is not the clash of the Native American culture versus the White culture, but rather a clash of the Anglo-American culture versus the Germans from Russia immigrant culture. It is of two white cultures that have different views of life and how it is to be lived. It is well worth the read. The book arrived in good time and was as described."
1,Palm TX,"this is a very nice palm. the battery life is great, the internet in fantastic etc.However, sometimes it freezes on me, so I need to reset it.....no biggie, but still that shouldn't happen. The programs are really good, especially do I enjoy the DataViz to Go.....The calender is good as well. however, I have tried to use it to keep a record of my homework, but it doesn't work well enough for that.However, you can always download a program for that :)"
0,What the?!,"People seem to say this movie is so realistic. The storyline was so weak. The main character kept cussing to make it sound realistic. It sounds stupid. They were trying too hard.It had some decent pyrotechnics, but thats about it. The story was terrible. It was so offbeat and didn't flow smoothly.What really bugged my about this made-for-TV movie was they spent a lot of money on making it realistic, they should have spent money on a better script.Is the main character wearing lipstick???"
1,Not bad,"I bought this for purposes other than playing fighting games (but do use it for fighting games)Briefly1. the stick itself is not tall enough; from the base to the ball its like an inch and a half. For people who like to use the palm of their hand instead, this may be hard, especially with bigger hands2. the top part rotates; not sure if this is a positive or negative quality, but when i move the joystick sometimes i just rotate the top while not moving the stick, theres no friction from the ball on the metal post3. The base should be bigger so you can rest at least some of your hands in front of the buttons and next to the joystickOther than that, for 45bucks...this is pretty hard to beat, the quality is very good, inputs are accurate, the buttons are not flimsy...cant beat this stick at its price...its just a less expensive alternative to the 100+ ones -- drawback is its size...great stick on a budgetNOT WIRELESS"
0,Buried Onions,"Eddie the main character in the story has had his father, his couisin, and his best friend killed by stupid street violence.Eddie handles himself pretty good."
1,"Looks great, works as advertised!","Got this for $30 (yes thirty!) at walmart.It does what it says, runs silently! I was very impressed since this is the first tank I've had in many years...I remember the old NOISY pumps. Very nicely designed, filter and light fit and finish is great. The light heats up the water quite a bit, it got too warm for my goldfish...but you can replace the bulb with a flourescent which won't throw out so much heat.Has the newest features in the filter system, a ""bio wheel"" which helps break down toxins in the water.Do be careful with the power cord routing, it can get scraped/frayed when you are replacing the top. Might be best on a desk or high up where you can see it from 3 or four sides, rather than just the front, because of the shape..."
1,"I have met ""No David.""","The adult David in my life I know acted as the child in David Shannons' book ""No David."" I purchased the book for my ""David"" for Christmas and it was the gift that was shared the most with friends and family. I highly recommend this book to those with an individual in their life child or an adult who doesn't understand the meaning of ""NO!"" The artwork is delightful and captivating and is the type of book that will be well treasured on the shelf to be read again and again. To David Shannons mother the thoughts of... better days are coming... must have been thought frequently when her David was a child. Be sure to enjoy this book with someone and make them smile!"
1,Now this is a Great blower.,"I LOVE this thing. It works GREAT. The blower is powerful, and I have had no problem with the vacuum. Going out to the garage to get my blower is so exciting. I lose track of time blowing the dirt and leaves out of my driveway. Today I even picked up all the garbage in the street with my vacuum. I was surprised how heavy the bag gets with the leaves, dirt,etc, but all you have to do it empty and pop it back on. Very easy to change from blower to vac, and back again.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
1,We love it.,"The only thing we don't like about it is the cradle contraption. On the one had it's ok because the battery is rechargeable, on the other hand it's a pain to have all of the cables to hook up just to download photos. We had a different model that just plugged right in to the computer, which was much simpler. All in all though we are very pleased with the camera's performance."
0,The Jedi?,"This game was great up until a few days ago, when the combat upgrade hit the live servers. Now it has gotten so bad that a Swordsman can take on 2 Jedi Padawan at once, and it be an even fight. This swordsman had no armor, and both Jedi ran out of force power near the end of the battle. Thanks SOE great job ...... yeah right!!"
0,Not compatible with Windows 7!,I have to return mine since it is not compatible with Windows 7. Palm tech support confirmed the definite incompatibility. Wish I would have known this before I had to pay a ridiculous restocking fee.
0,Worst Movie Ever,"Okay, so it may not be the worst movie ever, but it definately ranks way down there. As far as I can see, it has only one redeeming segment. The scene where the alligator (or whatever it was) is having drug induced Vietnam flashbacks, that was pretty good. In fact, if that had been the only scene, I might have given this movie a good review. The rest of the movie was the sorriest piece of trash I have ever had the misfortune to sit through. I turned the movie off about half way through because it was so bad. I then watched the second half to see if it could get any worse... and it did. This movie was not funny, intelligent, thought provoking, or even mildly entertaining. The only emotions it got out of me was loathing and numbness."
1,What a refreshing change from the garbage out there.,"The Derailers have a style that brings back the real country music sound. Not only do they sound good, but they look even better live. They put on an unbelievably good show that will have you moving in your seat if you're not brave enough to get up and dance. A fun, refreshing change to the country sounds played on most major radio stations. We dig the Derailers!!!"
0,Elementary,Society has obviously moved the art of war to a higher level making this a curiosity rather than anything of substance.
0,A Horrible Movie of TITANIC Proportions,"This animated adaption of this so-called ""movie"" should not be seen by the human eye. It's because of the infamous traumatizing, horrible ""rapping dog"" scene. It rots both your brain and your very innocent soul. This movie SHOULD sink into the depths of the ocean like the titanic."
0,I don't recommend this product.,"Product: I didn't care for it as the pad is hard plastic and you can't place anything on the pad, like a soft blanket. There are other heating pads that are made to go under blankets or pillows. I returned this and got the other style.Seller: Arrived quickly, in good condition, return was hassle free."
0,"Good plot, weak telling","Unraveling of the plot is long drawn out, even though the plan might have been good.The religious stuff, then, it has nothing to do with it."
1,Works Just Fine,"We have one of these and I've just ordered another, it works fine. I've been able to accurately test the temp of a grilled pork tenderloin, pull it off at 145 degrees and found the expected doneness inside. As is any analog thermometer, it takes 15 secs or so to completely register, just have to wait until the needle stops moving. If you need instant readout, the digital affairs are available (and way more expensive). Too, any thermometer, regardless of type or cost, will require the correct depth of probe - this model will give you consistent results."
0,Collecting dust,"Well, technically, it works! I bought this over a year ago, and I was able to restore two or three dvds right away. But for the price, I should have just bought used dvds that work. One go only seems to strip about 80% of the way around the dvd. The replacement wheel costs too much to bother buying. I would recommend only buying this for dvds that are irreplaceable. And don't kid yourself- you can't effectively buff these dvds by hand afterward, I tried. You will have to strip more, using up more of the wheel's precious grit, and your dvd will look like crap. Either buy a buffer, or take your resurfaced dvds to a game shop to have them buffed for a small fee. I don't think I quite got my money's worth out of it, but will just cut my losses."
1,"As with cars, so with film: the faster the better","Kodak makes the industy's best film. Period. Like the title says, the faster the film, the better the results (for amatures anyway). 400 is the minimum that any amatuer should buy, and generally the results are pretty good. 800 speed is even better, but be prepared to pay more for it. 800 is good for low light and high-speed subjects. However, for most situations, 400 should be fine."
1,"Sad Slice of Life, Well Told","This book reflects with painful accuracy the cruel existence of so many poor people in the United States, particularly in New York. Walking these same streets every day, I can say that LeBlanc has captured the very essence of the lives of these people. It is not until one spends time--real time--in a community like the one described here, that one can understand the thinking that goes on. Babies being raised by grandmothers and greatgrandmothers, children being sexually abused by boyfriends of grandmothers, kids being carted off to see their parents in prison. These are real, everyday happenings. This book serves well as a warning call: Unless and until we--those of us who do not live in such an environment--are willing to help make things better, more and more children will be lost to this impossible existence. The author did a beautiful job of showing life as it is, and sadly will be for a long time to come, for so many poor people."
0,I won't even give this DVD away,"Just because something has Disney's name on it doesn't mean it is good. This DVD is just awful. I watched it with my 5 year old granddaughter, who loves Belle, and even she said it was 'horrible.' The Beast was ill-tempered throughout the stories, along with being selfish, churlish and childish. There are no good messages for children in this DVD. I am throwing it away as in good conscious I can't donate it to any charity."
0,Dosen't play well,This DVD does not play well at all. I wish I would have purchased this elsewhere. The price for this should have been much less to equal the quality.
0,not all it's cracked up to be,I loved the artwork John Byrne has always been a favorite of mine but unfortunatly that's all I got out of this book. the story jumps around too much I wasn't really sure where i was in the story. The charecters were not as fleshed out as I anticipated. To shorten my critique It's a beautifull package but not much more than that.
0,What were you thinking Joan?,"I've long been a fan of Joan's distinctive vocal sound. What a shame that in her later career she has been the victim of cheesy arrangements and second rate material. Only a few tracks on this CD are listenable. I'm going to look around for some of her earlier, more folksy songs."
0,Atrocious! Not Atreides!,"This is the worst possible adaptation imaginable. I would have given them credit for changing the story in positive ways -- due to the difficulty of translating such a complex novel. However, this adaptation doesn't even succeed as good space opera.The script, the art direction, the editing -- everything about this movie sucks.I'm not one of those people who thinks that a movie should be faithful to a novel. In fact, a few movies have been definitely better than their books -- notably Jaws, even Silence of the Lambs (book was very good, the movie a masterpiece). However, the point in changing a story is to make something worth watching. Read the book and hope someone makes a better version some day. (I don't recommend the whole of Herbert's series. Dune is excellent. The rest get worse in rapid progression)."
1,amazing product,"i was diagnosed 5 yrs ago about my health problem, the doctor's advice was no operation/surgery because it might cause complications,i live it that way , until it became worse, the Oil of Oregano save me to have surgery. it really works for me. i recommend it to my friend.she ordered already. thanks."
0,Blender not all it promises,"When you read the description about this blender on the box, it seems like a great blender. You find though, that when using it, it does not live up to its description. I put in some ice cubes and after about 3 min. of trying to get it to crush the ice the motor promptly burned out. This blender is not worth the trouble or the money."
1,Gently strides the border of bluegrass and folk,"A wonderful, melodic album. As Allison Kraus does, uses arrangement for the purpose of the music (not just verse-chorus-break, verse-chorus-break). The harmonies are gorgeous, and the song selection diverse. An outstanding disk - stands above the crowd."
1,"Not bad, but a bit contrived","It's a bit of a catchy sounding album but the vocals are a bit too contrived. It seems like they are trying too hard to sound like Interpol, Bauhaus or Joy Division. It's ok to be influenced by other bands but you should have a unique sound too.That said, I do listen to this album and I kind of like it."
1,If you still have misunderstandings about aids,"If you have any misunderstandings of aids, especially Pediatric Aids this is the most knowledgeable book to read and to educate yourself. From the moment in 1999 while I was watching the Essence Awards and heard Hydeia's acceptance speech for her award. I was automatically moved. I cried during her speech and I cried reading this book. I was sympathetic to her condition and was wondering what she must have went through as a child. She had a pretty good childhood and her mom was just so honorable to take on her and her little sister."
1,MTD Twin Grasscatcher,Arrived as advertised. Took about 20 min to set up and works great. Would highly recommend.
1,Very good,Nothing magical about this item. i'm sure my baby likes having a warm wipe across his butt than a cold one. the only thing i notice is that the wipes are extra wet.
1,"Beautiful creations, but...","Kumiko is a master of her craft and her book shows some of her cutest work. While the patterns are fairly simple. she leaves out important hints that make recreating her projects difficult if you aren't paying attention. Pay close attention to the weight and type of fabric that she uses but does not mention in her directions. If you use a heavier fabric than what she used, you may need to adjust the pattern to make it work. I wouldn't recommend this for a complete beginning sewer. Otherwise this is a great book full of fun projects."
0,5 Months and Dead,"Are you kidding me!! I paid extra ($153)and bought direct from Amazon and the (ThinkPad T/R/W/Z/SL Series 9 Cell Li-Ion Battery Sold by: Amazon.com, LLC) lasts five months. Piece of crap!! Looked new, Lenovo packaging, it just died."
0,Not very clear printing on this paper,"I like that the sheets are perferated for easy triming, but the picture quality of the paper was not good and I ended up using photo paper to make my lables instead of this product."
0,Pitiful and Tasteless,"This was a very contrived and manipulated plot. The sexual incidents bordered on soft porn, in addition to blaspheming sacred things. The style, vocabulary and literary features I long for in good reading were sorely missing. This is the first book I have read by the author and will be the last. When I finished the book, I tossed it in a trash can in front of my students. They were amazed. I simply said, ""if I want a little piece of steak I don't go to the bottom of a garbage can to find it."""
1,wireless linksys adapter,"thanks for fair price, great service. sent product right away, and it's performed well."
1,"Good, but repetitive ...","Having read the books 'The Inner Game of Trading' and 'The Tao of Trading', it is obvious that there are significant overlappings. This does not change my opinion that Robert Koppel has identified the critical success factors of trading. Because market behaviour is unpredictable in many cases, his various recommendations make a lot of sense and may help to become an overall winner in a volatile environment. His book gives valuable insights into the psychology of trading, but is no substitute for fundamental market expertise."
1,Good read!,"I read some of the other reviews, and I agree and disagree with what was being said.Yes, it did get boring at times, but the last 3-4 chapters made the entire experience worth it!Perhaps I'm just not as good a guesser as others, but I was caught completely off guard and surprised by the ending.Most books don't make me say things out loud, but this one did.So, I say check it out!What's there to lose, besides time that would just be wasted on something else?"
1,Too limiting,"I think this wonderful book does itself a disservice by limiting itself to what *women* want. In most cases, women want the same things any customer, male or female, wants: to be treated fairly, with respect, and with appreciation. Mary Lou Quinlan has done her homework, that's for sure, but I have heard her speak and I don't think I've ever taken so many notes in my life. The best book on this topic, bar none, is Paco Underwood's ""Why We Buy,"" but this one should also be on the shelf of any sales and/or marketing manager interested in examining why people make those crucial buying decisions - whether a candy bar or an automobile."
1,Best armband i've ever used,"I've been using this armband at the gym for about a week now and i've had no complaints at all. It staps onto your arm very easy and stays snug. The sansa slips into the slot and stays perfectly in place with pretty good protection (even the screen). I've used this armband on the treadmill, eliptical, bike and lifting weights and haven't had a problem with it yet. If you want to take your sansa with you when you do physical activity, this is the armband for you!"
0,THE ONLY SCARY PART OF THIS MOVIE WAS THAT IT WAS MADE.,"How STUPID a movie can you make? Well, Campfire Tales has taken the worst parts of every other movie in the teen shlock genre and combined into one terrifyling aweful turn-it-off-or-trash-it garbage circus of lameness. If you consider yourself to have any taste at all, you will not be caught dead with this movie. And finally, I must say that I am ashamed of the good folks at New Line for sinking so low. THANKYOU."
0,HTML,"Do not waste your effort, time and money.Deceptive and very vague. The author refers to chapters as hours the examples are vague at best. The continued use of incorrect wording is annoying.I gave this book a second try and came to same conclusion, this book have by a liberal democrap. Always lying."
0,"amazon hides all the negative reviews, haha!","This band is better than Nickelback, but then again most bands are.British hype bands, man...remember Menswear? I can see by your face that you don't.Franz Ferdinand are slightly better."
0,The worst movie ever,I had high hopes for this movie. After Meg Ryan being off the scene for some some I thought she was better than this movie. It started off with the star wanting to commit sucide and the first five minutes were the worst part of the film - and depressing. The movie had no plot and certainly no substance. There was a LOT of profanity which could have been left out. I thought Hollywood and certainly Meg Ryan could have faired better. Don't waste your time and money on this one.
1,The leading authority on emeralds,"John Sinkankas' Emerald and Other Beryls is a must have have book for all gemologists. As Director of the Smithsonian Institute's Natural History Museum, Sinkankas' experience and knowledge on the subject is unsurpassable. As an emerald exporter myself, I have learned more about the characteristics of the gemstone from him than any other source I have looked into. Excellent information. A. Morales Bogota, Colombia"
1,"A great book for those seeking peace, direction and calmness","I saw a part of Dr. Dyer's seminar on the Learning Channel one night and I knew that I had to get this book. It took me some time to read it, not because it was hard to read, but because it was so interesting that I had to take notes on the side and highlight certain sections. It is a great book if you are looking for peace in your life, a new direction and calmness. The priciples are nothing new but there are things that we take for granted for example the pricinple of positivity. We tend to concentrate our full energy on the negative aspects of life and our loved ones. When in reality what we are doing is attracting negativity and bringing it upon ourselves. How can we expect good things to happen to us if our thoughts and our aura are filled with negativity???This is a book that you need to read several times to grasp every time around different concepts and new meanings that can enlighten your life."
0,"So so video, goof audio and no night vision","The video monitor is like watching a tv from the 70's - it is black and white with alot of 'snow' noise and horizontal bars constantly. Also, the night vision does not appear to be working and after reading some of the other reviews here, it seems this is not a well built quality item and the night vision seems to have problems elsewhere.Good luck with your purchase! Hopefully it goes better for you."
0,Pain in the neck,"It's about 1 cm too short. You can just barely zip a U.S. passport inside, by stretching the fabric and bending the passport. Also, perspiration condensed inside the plastic window. After 17 days in Europe, my passport got so bent up that it took about a dozen swipes of the scanner before Customs could read it."
0,Pretty but not very functional,"I really liked the racks, and when I installed them on the bar shelf, they looked great. The problem is, they dont hold very many wine glasses. The opening is too small. i took them off and replaced them with some that I purchased at a wine store. They would work well for champagne glasses."
1,The Family Tree Problem Solver: Proven Methods,Interesting book that provides the reader with ideas about different avenues of researching those problematic and elusive ancestors we all seem to have in our trees. Recommend.
1,Conformation of arivle.,"I have been a fan of T.A.T.u ever since ""all the things she sead. To me it`s theire sound and vocals that I like. I am not in to the love thing, gay or otherwise. They are a fantastic duo, and they play well live. That is the criteria of an artist. Now since this girls have that, this album is conformation of there arivle. I can strongly rekomend both the cd and the dvd. In my apinion this is eccelent."
0,Complete waste of time,"A totally amateur made DVD. It really doesn't tell you much about blue water cruising, but at least you get 15 mins of some mealy-mouthed couple talking jiberish about their boat. This DVD is way overpriced and is about as sophisticated a production as my kids' skateboard videos..."
1,Great HOA Book,"This book is well written without a lot of ""fluffy"" space filling verbiage. It gets to points quickly and the organization is very good. If you are involved in an HOA this book will really help. Get your state HOA rules/regs, along with this book, and you will be able to get a handle on your responsibilities as either a HOA board member or a HOA member. Great price too."
0,not worth a dime,PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY ON YHIS THIN PAPERBACK. I BOUGHT THIS AFTER MY HUSBAND DIED. IT WAS NOT WORTH A DIME AND SHOULD'T BE IN PRINT. I WAS LOOKING FOR A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION THAN WHAT YOU MIGHT FIND IN THE NEWSPAPER.
0,This book is a joke,"According to Eat Right 4 Your Type, I should eat a vegetarian diet based on whole grains because I am blood type A. I tried this for a little while and got so sick - turned out I had a gluten intolerance. If this book works for you it can probably be attributed to luck more than anything else. I suggest Food and Western Disease: Health and nutrition from an evolutionary perspective by Staffan Lindeberg. It's real science and worth every penny."
0,First book I've ever thrown away,"Poorly written, the story seems to have been created by a monkey with short term memory loss. The plot progresses slowly with insignificant points drilled into the reader's head over and over again.I picked it up in the airport and was looking forward to diving into it, mostly because of the hype on the cover. Later that day I actually threw it away in disgust."
1,"Good information, but graphics could use improvement","The information and recipes found in this book are great. The only downside is, without nice colorful pictures, it is hard to gain the attention of a younger audience. My daughter didn't care for it due to the lack of photographs. There were illustrations, but when we're talking about food, you really need photographs."
1,Good beginning to a series,"This was an enjoyable read, though grisly in places, and I hope the rest of the series is as good. The murderer is revealed rather early on, which I usually don't like, but there were enough plot surprises to make up for that. My only real quibble is that the first 2 murders reference the nursery rhyme ""As I was going to St. Ives..."" which then disappears for the rest of the novel. It wasn't a necessary device to begin with, so his editor should have caught this. But overall a worthwhile mystery."
0,Garbage Remix With 80's Gimmickry,"As part of an attempt to capitalize on the success of their Eliminator sound, ZZ Top decided to go back into the studio and remix and also re-record parts of their first 6 albums thinking it would make them more money and entice fans of their newer sound to go back and buy their earlier records. Well guess what, in the process their older fans who were used to the original versions on the old cassettes and albums were shocked when they listened to any of these first generation CD releases. They heard bogus reverbed drums, and entire sections of both music and vocals re-recorded. Talk about tarnishing the legacy of a great band's output. Well someone finally wised up and now at least Tres Hombres and Fandango are now available in original mix, remastered form. So stay away from this trash and wait for the entire back catalog to be released in it's original mix, remastered form on CD."
1,Need To Have,"This is a great remix - the one that should have been done 15 years ago, and now finally has been. A must for all Stevie fans. I like version 3 & 5 best. I'm not sure if these are all new vocals ala ""Dreams"" or just re-mixed?? I think they're new vocals."
1,Good to accompany a life drawing class,I bought this book quite a while ago and had difficulty getting much from it because I had never had an anatomy class or a life drawing class. Now that I am taking an intensive anatomy/life drawing class I find it excellent and a valuable resource. I have a very good class book called Classic Human Anatomy by Valerie Winslow to show me literal anatomy. This muscle is here and is called this. You need this. But the greatness of Robert Beverly Hale's books are to also show you how these muscles appear in classical drawings. This is a different matter all together. It is the difference between an academic diagram and a great drawing. You need BOTH books and a live drawing class model to get the whole picture (no pun intended!).
1,breadman,"I use my bread machine to make dough. When ready I remove it and bake it myself in the traditional way. When mixing sometimes there will be stuff left in the corners. If I check inside during the mixing phase and scrape the corners this problem can be eliminated- it's just a pain and I don't always remember to do it. It makes great dough, it's easy to use, and is easy to clean. I make all of my own baked goods from scratch. I use my Breadman two or three times per week and could only be happier if it washed itself and put itself away...."
1,A Must for the prog collector,"It is hard to pick the best CD from IQ. They have so many great ones- Ever, The Wake, Dark Matter. But, The Seventh House is their best. This Cd will send chills, thrills and restore your faith in prog music. It is really amazing that IQ and Pallas are still producing such great music so late in the game. It is a testament to their artistic professional ability and their love of the prog genre. Absolutely essential!!!"

1,I Love the book!,"This is one of the best humerous books I have read in a long time. It takes a lot to make me laugh and reading this book did just that! I love the way the author brings humor into the everyday struggles that we see in some people. I like her theme, ""Watch how they praise the Lord and you do the opposite"" This book will not only make you laugh but will also help you to examine yourself to make sure you are being a godly example to others. I wish the author much success. I am looking forward to reading many, many, more of her writing."
0,Too flimsy,I have the Belkin but ordered this for my son's fiancee. It's too flimsy and I'm embarrassed I purchased it for her. Would not recommend.
1,You Just Can't Go Wrong!,"How could you go wrong with book that has contributions from Maeve Binchy (Circle of Friends / The Scarlet Feather / Tara Road) Marian Keyes (one of my personal favs : Watermelon / Rachel's Holiday / Under the Duvet) and Cathy Kelly (Someone Like You / What She Wants)?? Well, I'll answer that for you. You can't. This wonderful collection of stories from the best of Irish writers is a true find and a wonderful introduction for those who aren't familiar with their work. It's a really nice and funny collection that can bring you to tears one minute and laughter the next.I just loved it - and there is no doubt that I will be giving this away for gifts in the near future!Cheers!"
0,The worst textbook I have ever read,"In my opinion this book should NOT be used in colleges and universities. It is convoluted and filled with superfluous text that distracts and dilutes the existing weak content. It is poorly structured and is redundant in some areas while completely lacking in others. The fact that it costs as much as it does is shameful. What a waste of time, trees and money."
1,Toy and treats,A great toy with rewards. One of our two cats seems to enjoy it more then the other. It does inhibit boredom eating.
1,Beauty in its simplicity,"This ring is perfect for those who wish to express their feelings without being over-the-top or in your face. It is a simple silver band with the engraved message on the inside. The only drawback for me is that I wish I could get it for my current girlfriend, but I'd feel weird seeing as my ex bought her and I matching rings in this style.Still, it is a durable ring that will endure any sort of bang ups (I know cuz I lead a busy, rough life), and still remain a lasting reminder of your love for you other."
1,Very detailed,"Hicks has a lot to offer in this book on activity-based costing, however it is not an easy to read. It very quickly dives into the weeds of detail. I think this is a very good second book to read on Activity Based Costing, because it goes into the details of how to actually implement a system. I would recommend that you first read Kaplan's ""Cost and Effect,"" to get a good grounding in the fundamentals before reading this book."
0,Barron's needs an editor...,"I am appalled by the errors in this book - and I have only studied the Math and Science sections so far. Some of the answers are glaringly wrong. Some of the statements are completely inconsistent with each other or with the quiz answers. That said, on the bright side, researching the science inconsistencies has taught me a lot. The breadth of the subject matter is actually helpful and there were some beneficial explanations in this book that I did not find in others - but don't always trust the answers given and do research the inconsistencies."
1,"The irony of ""Lucky"".","""Lucky"" is Alice Sebold's ironically titled rape narrative. Her blunt and frank recall of her assault are daunting but - as she notes - she is ""lucky"" to have survived. While not for the faint-hearted her story is important. I recommend it to a broad readership because it poses questions about violence, family, law, punishment and recovery. I liked the truth of this biography and its pacing. Although there is another rape narrative near the end, it added nothing to strengthen the core theme; the book would have done well without it.Personalized, micro-histories of this sort offer valuable opportunities to understand, interpret and feel what are too often vague, anonymous news articles. Sebold's direct style courageously stares this kind of crime straight in the eye without blinking. It is a solid read and a valuable story."
0,Don't even bother,"It was a good attempt for a first time publishing author. I'm holding more hope for his subsequent books, however. This one was a flop: it starts out interesting with a thickening plot, but it loses steam and becomes exponentially ridiculous and cheesy. Some of the dialogue from Ashley to her son Jason made me want to gag. All of that ""hun"" talk is quite antiquated and unnecessary. I made it 3/4 through the novel and had to call it quits when I realized it wasn't worth my time. A good attempt, sir, but the next must be better than this or you're off my list."
1,Yellow Box are the Best,Love Yellow Box!!! Desperately needed this color. I wear Yellow Box all the time and they all wear wonderfully. This pair is no different.
1,Excellent Documentary,"This is an excellent documentary. Of course, it includes the famous newsreel and radio broadcast of the airship's destruction, but it also describes the history of airships and sets forth the political and economic circumstances surrounding the Hindenburg. It also makes a balanced presentation of the various viewpoints on what caused the ship to explode. I heartily recommend the purchase and viewing of the videotape."
1,Incredible Music.,"It's too bad they went belly up. They are easily, one of the most interesting bands of all time. Very inspirational"
0,Round Up The Usual Suspects,"Just another exercise in intellectual onanism by the right-wing, sticking pins into dolls representing things they don't like, while pretending that Bush didn't lie through his teeth to get us into Iraq, that Cheney isn't a war profiteer, that ""compassionate conservatism"" isn't an oxymoron--It's all a sideshow, meant to distract from the high crimes, misdemeanors, and just plain stupidity of the Dubbya Administration. Nothing you haven't heard before, be you on the left or right. So get some K-Y and get pumped up."
0,Small budget Star Trek.,"ST2 is an enjoyable adventure marred by a miniscule budget.The budget was so small that they re-used effects from the first film,used a television film crew,re-used the bridge set 3 different times for different ships and didn't have the money to finish the Eden Cave effect which was over-exposed.The ship's power source(which Spock repairs)looks like a giant salt shaker on a disco dance floor,hardly the large power source that it should have been,due to the tiny budget of 3 and a half million dollars(the real budget reported at the time).On the plus side,the battle scenes are eccellent,although the nebula looked a little fake at times,and the Kirk/Spock/McCoy interactions are fun the watch.After the slow STTMP,it was good to see the relationships and humour re-ignited on ST2.Nicholas Meyer's direction is good and the music by James Horner is a highlight.So,if you like an entertaining B-grade film then ST2 will entertain you."
1,Good Cleats,"These cleats are light, comfortable, and have very good spikes on the bottom. They are molded, but are different than most molded cleats, they are all separate and they are long... ultimate traction. The only bad thing about these cleats is the white upper of the shoe gets scuffed some."
0,Horribe Horrible Horrible,"This book was so horrible it wasn't even funny. There was no redeeming qualities for either of the two main characters! How can you even label it a romance. It was a tragedy. Not only did the writing/plot not make a lot of sense, constantly jumping around and such but the characters lacked even a smidgen of morals!!! The H slept with the h's best friend who was a .... well I think you know and he didn't seem to give a care about all the abuse that the h went through at the hands of her so called ""step brother""! Nope he just added to it. I think this book is more a study in obsession. Sick Obesession!!!!! It really would have been better if Trista had just disappeared never to be seen again. I think Blaze would have been just fine with that. I know I would have been fine with those two not getting together. . . EVER!!!!!! Can't see how anyone could ever say those two loved each other."

1,The Masses Will Obey,"This Is A Great CD, I Could Listen To It Begining To End Every Time I Put It In. I Mean I Love The Butal Music, James Growling Vocals And The Lyrics Are Great.

Mabey This Never Happened To Him But Anyone Whos Ever Been In This Situation Would Get This Song. Like The Lyric ""How Much Can I Take, This Mans Mind Fueled By Hate, How Could You Just Let Him Pound My Damn Head Like This.""

1,Exactly what you are expecting!,"This movie is exactly what you think it is. That being said, it is better than most due to production values and attractive women. When I say attractive women, I mean they did a casting call and some of the girls did not make the cut (I'm looking at you every movie by The Asylum).It also gets a bonus star for being actually scary. Not the story, or the tone or even the freaky killer. The scariest part of this movie was Beetlejuice. Seriously. That guy gives me the creeps. Worth a rental and the picture quality (streaming) was excellent."

1,good cd but what happened!!!!!,"ok first off this cd is not at all like the old a static lullaby cd. Which is a freakin great cd. An unbelievable cd at that. This cd is pretty good. They sounds different, not completely different but pretty different. I bought this cd becuase the old one was so amazing. But dont get me wrong there are some really good songs on here, for example: radio flyers last journey is amazing ( best song ), half man half shark.... is a pretty good song, shotgun is a good song, calmer than you are is great, faso latido is great, god bless you is very awesome, marilyn monorobot is very awesome the chorus is great, jesus haircut is pretty good. Stand up is horrible and cashcow buttbell is horrible as well. If you do buy this cd please buy the old one too it is way way better but this cd is good. Or if you dont want this cd get the underoath cd or a change of pace ( FREAKING BAD ASS CD )"

Pre-schoolers would enjoy reading it and like the overall message."
0,Punch-Drunk Love,"What a complete and total waste of 95 minutes of my life, not including the money I spent purchasing this DVD. I have always been an Adam Sandler fan, but there was not one scene worth watching in this movie. And for everyone to say how great it is, doesn't have a clue what a great movie should be. Save your time and money, you will thank me for being the only person truthful enough to state it the way it really is!"

1,You would spend the money on a digal thermometer anyway!,I think the items in this kit work well. You get more than you would if you were to buy the thermometer alone .... So for the price it is worth it to have the extras on hand or to throw in your bag when traveling.
1,AWESOME!,"I picked up this disc when it came out also. I have had it playing non-stop. I love how each track flows into the next. It takes you on a musical journey of extraordinary proportions. I can't get enough of Darren Hayes. This by far is the best he has ever done. If you have ever been a fan of Savage Garden or any of his earlier work, you must pick this up."

0,junk!,"I am a flash beginner and right now I am in the middle of chapter 2 of the book. I must say that I am already quite frustrated with the lack of details and errors. I have been following step by step with the examples but when i get to the end, things aren't the same as the final example. Thinking that I was messing up, I would go through the steps again just to see if I missed something. Well, after reading the other reviews, it is obvious that there are some serious problems with this book. Not so sure i want to use this to learn how to create flash movies incorrectly! Don't waste your money!"

0,Don't waste your money!,"I purchased this adaptor at Walmart. At first I thought I was grtting a good deal at $7.44, until I plugged it into my phone (V3c Razr). It seemed pretty snug so I pulled it out and to my dismay I noticed that it had what looked like a bent pin. I looked at the phone's connector and it had one as well. Luckily I was able to repair my phone by myself. I went back to Walmart and tried the other two they had in stock, and they all suffered from the same problem. Needless to say I will probably never by another Belkin product again."
0,"Funny BadMovie Sometimes Good 3-D Effects, Sometimes Not!!!","The Movie is funny, bad movie with Anthony acting like Clint Eastwood cousin, Shoot in Spain, If you want to see all the 3-d effects it's important to adjust at perfection the Tv screen.My advice : Turn down the color on the Edge to the Black&White, and turn Up the brightness (sometimes it's difficult to achieve, but believe me, it works)(be patient)The bests 3-d shotts are in general the Wide Shots, the problem is sometimes in the close ups"
1,Winning History for the holidays,"This is another in the series of programs hosted by Harry Smith that reveal the reasons behind all of the things we have come to expect as part of our celebrations of various holidays. They never fail to amaze first time viewers who usually have no idea why they carve Jack O'Lanterns, send Christmas cards or set off fireworks at the seasonal gatherings of their friends and families."

0,Too Sad & Maudlin For Me,"This is designed to be a tear jerker, so keep a roll of toilet paper or some Kleenex on hand if you dare watch this one.Although I liked the book and thought the film adaptation fairly decent, I could not stand the maudlin song that shares the title of the movie.The story is this: in 1985, a lawyer whose marriage is crumbling meets a little boy whose mother is dying. It turns out that Nathan, the boy is the lawyer's wife's pupil. Nathan wants to buy his dying mother shoes so she will look nice when she goes to see Jesus. If that ain't sad enough, the part where Nathan listens to her heart to see if she is still alive was just too hard for me. I had to leave the room on that part. It hammers you over the head with what is really important in life, but still, as other reviewers on the US boards have said, I, too prefer something more upbeat and cheery for the holidays. Although the movie was well acted, the execrable song cost it two stars. That was overkill."
1,"A frightening tale of an enslaved, socialist future","1984 is frightening. 1984 is thought-provoking. 1984 is a literary masterpiece, warning society of a possible future that would more or less end meaning in life. There's little more I can say. Just read the book for yourself; it's what I call required reading."
1,Great companion for the books,Everything that you cant figure out in the books and manual...you can see with your own eyes. This is a valuable asset if you are new to the Canon Digital Rebel XT or XTi
1,Love this book!!!,This is not only the best book on healing that I have ever read but it is simply the best book period next to the bible. I love how he also gives you actual miracles examples too of those that were healed. I look forward to reading more of TL Osborn's books in the future!
0,"Great idea, poor sound quality","I was so disappointed with the sound quality of this device that I returned it. Music files that sounded great on my computer were noticably reduced in quality due to the FM transmission. I thought Audio Books would work, but there is so much hissing and buzzing that it was hard to concentrate on the book. BE WARNED there is NO REWIND or FAST-FORWARD through a track. There are only forward and backward track skip. If you have a large audio book file and lose your place or forget to pause when you leave the car, you cannot get back to your position in the file. The device ""remembers"" which track you were playing when it loses power, but it starts over from the beginning of the track, not at the place in the track where you left off, as in a CD player. The lack of a power switch seems quite odd to me as well. Overall, the device seemed like a great idea, but it just wasn't thought out well enough."
1,Loved this movie!,"My children saw this movie when they were very small in Germany. We bought the VHS because there wasn't DVDs then and they played it to death. They loved Natty Gann. I saw it on Instant and could not believe it. I had to see it again. My oldest son, a slain police officer,@22years old, loved the fact that the wolf got top billing at the end of the movie. He loved the fact that it ended with Wolf played by Jed"". I miss my son so much and when I see this movie, I am reminded how much he loved these type of movies. It was nice to remember our times together. Natty Gann, was one of his favorite, now mine as well."
1,Protection with a good price,This is some AMAZING yellow plastic. This little piece of yellow plastic keeps you light from being broken. It's totally worth buying. BUY IT. YOU WANT THAT! BUY IT!
1,Lots of use!!,"This was bought as a christmas gift for my 18 mon old. He uses it at EVERY bath time, it ashes right off his skin, doesn't turn soft and mushy like other bath crayons or soap crayons. I like that all the colors are in one item. It does take a bit of time to wash it off the tub, you definatly need soap to get it off all the way, but no staining so far!"
0,Defective DVD,"The series is an excellent drama. The main complaint is that the DVD quality is poor. This is the second time that I bought the set of DVDs and more than one of the DVDs is defective. We tried cleaning it, using another DVD, etc, and the video would continue to pause or skip in the middle of play. It is very frustrating that even buying this series the second time would still have defects. Something needs to be reported to the company that manufactures these DVDs."
1,great unreleased tracks!,"what a great disk,why in the world most of these songs didn't make it the official albums is beyond my ears,especially the unreleased track from ""fallen angel"",'a right to live'.other highlights include,'split image(no guitar in ear sight),just a synth driven track,great vocals from peter goalby(my second fave heep singer,you know who's best!),'high and mighty'outtake'name of the game'is another great heep heft-rocker and probably better than anything off that album.so why only 4 stars?,due to the fact that there's too many tracks from the bernie shaw era(sorry,but he's a really cheezy vocalist)and he does really sabotage the live tracks of older byron-sung classics."
1,Mrs. Wilkes' is A+,"Mrs. Wiles' cookbook is as good as what she puts on the table. Glad to have this book, allows me to introduce some fine southern dish's to the yankee tables up here."
0,Disappointed,"We liked the idea of a built-in thermal carafe. But this machine has drawbacks that has made it more of a disappointment than a boon to us:1) The clock isn't backlit.2) The carafe doesn't hold very much coffee. The carafe's bulk is misleading.3) The darn thing drips for several minutes after it has stopped percolating.4) Pouring coffee out of it is a challenge, especially if you're getting near the bottom of the carafe.5) The coffee doesn't stay warm for long, even with the extra-bulky carafe.It is not worth the money we spent. Looks good on the counter, though.It's inevitable that we have to sop up coffee from somewhere every time we use it. Frankly, I want to drink it, not have it end up in a kitchen rag.Recommendation: Buy a Mr. Coffee and a good Thermos carafe (we got ours at a thrift shop for a quarter; it keeps coffee hot for 24 hours!)."
0,SideKick 2 is a bad phone,"I got this phone for christmas. So when I got It I noticed that almost all of the calls I got were not sent to my phone so I took my house phone and I called The sidekick2 and guess what it didn't ring, it even didn't say missed call. Then few Weeks latr the Camera breaks, When i go to take a picture it has a black screen. Another thing is the battery, The battery is located inside the phone so if your battery breaks you have to send it to T-mobile to fix it and it takes Around two weeks to fix and the insurence plan I pay for doesn't cover the battery. It cost me like $200. The service is just straight out bad I don't get service practicly any where.Please people don't bother reading the Teenagers reviews because they just use the aol instent messagenger they don't even care for anything else on the phone.I suggest you save your money and if you want a pda cell phone go for the palm treo's."
0,Leaked everywhere,"We thought spending the extra money for Swaddlers was worth it because of the wet line and the absorability. We were wrong. We love the smaller packages of Swaddlers that we've purchased locally. For whatever reason, this box didn't have the colored, wet line (to let you know your child is wet) and there seemed to be less absorbable lining (which we carefully examined after they seemed to leak numerous times). I haven't had leaking problems with any other diaper (even generic, store brands). I'm not sure if we got a bad batch or if this size is just made cheaper; but I wouldn't recommend them at all."
0,Pure Rubbish,"Ben Stein's 'movie' is nothing more than a propaganda piece that doesn't dare to look at anything rationally and objectively. If it had, he and his crew would have found out about the thousands and thousands of scientists that are able to do their jobs and hold their faiths both at the same time.It is not worth your time or money. In fact, I am going to have to increase the amount of money I give the NSF, just to make up for the money I spent watching it in a theater..."
1,Peaceful Heart/Strong Heart,"Aimee Jo has touched upon a subject many women are so scared to share with others...She opened up her heart, her soul and her gift of writing to show her walk into the valley of shadows..What a BRAVE and lovely woman Aimee Jo is...We always think something like this happens to the other person...but when it hits home..and becomes a reality...people tend to withdraw into themselves...Aimee Jo has showed us all the spirit, determination and unselfishness in sharing her story...What a wonderful gift she has given to women everywhere...showing that life can and will go on...Thank you Aimee..I intend to read it again and again...and have books for my two daughters for Christmas."
0,Monica's Story was a struggle to finish..,"I plunged into Monica's story with much anticipation, anxious to hear her take on all events that had transpired over the last year. The beginning staged Monica's life growing up, much more detail than most people probably care to know - I wanted to know about her relationship with the President (or at least her perspective) and not her entire life story. She isn't that valuable to society to have us all know this information. The book is not very well-written, with many typos and backwards English. If someone was writing this book about me, I'd make sure I came out looking a little less like a mental case. I found myself skipping pages toward the end and eventually just skipped to the last chapter. It's basically the same thing over and over again - and never once does Monica take ownership, she's always blaming others (maybe that was illustrated in the parts I skipped)."
0,Interesting from a clinical perspective,"If you would like a guided tour through the mind of a dim-witted sociopath, this is the book for you."
1,Better than before,"This second book was even better than the first one in the series. How is that possible? It is because it reveals places such as the nightmare room. Now what is the nightmare room? Well, it is as it's named, it is where you're living inside your nightmares. Yep, that is very horrible. Yet, there happened to be one person who had put up with it all and survived! Buy it and read it to see what happened!!"

0,sad sad day for savage,"If I were Daniel I would be sorely embarrassed. The first time I listened to this CD I hated it. The second time I strongly disliked it - only ""Insatiable"" started to grow on me, but even that is not a quality song. There is essentially no music on this CD - just computer generated crap accompanying adequate lyrics but awful melodies and beats. Darren is nothing without Daniel, and this solo attempt proves it."
0,guy movie!,"If a guy made this kine of film, people will say he is a porn star. What it wrong with that female actress? Does she have a low selfasteem or what? Maybe she is desperate for money."
1,Excellent until the last 50 pages,"I have read all of Kleypas's works and find them to be very well-written, entertaining, and compelling. This book fit the bill until the last 50 pages or so, when apparently our author realized she had to end the book. To say the least, the ending is farcical and almost unbelievable. Still, the book as a whole was very good, and although the most of the characters were stereotypes, they seemed to fit in this story. I look forward to her next book!"
1,A must read,"Having just finished this book, I am keen for everyone to read this wonderful and touching novel. The writer is very perceptive..managing to detail the heroes flaws yet keeping us, the reader, hoping for his redemption.I disagree with one reviewer who says it is a man's book..I think it is a book about the frailty and the strength of humanity. We are also given a slight glimpse into Afghanistan, a country we hear about constantly but fail to really know.The plight of Afghanis is examined and it is hard to come away from this book without having sympathy for these people.I also liked the way the book came full circle yet did not end with a neatly packaged ""happy ever after"" ending.Excellent."
1,Very enjoyable,"I have read other books about globalization, politics and philosophy but I have never enjoyed it as much as with this one. It's a wonderful love story that goes down like a good glass of wine and I actually picked up some useful information and great ideas on the way - DNA as the collective unconscious -what a great thought. The book really provides some optimism and faith, despite all the problems it deals with. I guess the message is this: it's all part of the process and we'll get there one way or another."
1,Great Job All,This movie tells a very good story. T.D. Jakes is a brilliant story teller. I didn't get to see it when it was in theaters due to limited distribution. I heard T. D. Jakes speaking about it on a radio program. My friend purchased the DVD as soon as it was released and was good enough to share it with me. Sharon Leal is so beautiful. She always brings her best to a project. She didn't disappoint. Blair Underwood also is always masterful. I am glad we live in a time that movies are made where these people can showcase their talents. I loved it.
1,Show Don't Tell,"Excellent guide - if you don't know how to do what the title says every writer needs to learn and do, get this book. Too vague? Open the book, read, practice...no 'ing' verbs, no 'would, could or shoulds'- no 'will' or , well, you get the idea?"
1,Final Fantasy 7 Guide for Playstation,A lovely book for FF7 fans. Each step in the story is explained and sidequests explored. Methods for gaining each character are included in both the main walkthrough and sidequest section for easy use.
1,"Grungey, jazzy, silent, loud","Made me fall in love with dEUS.The first album from the band, and you easily feel their style, and that the band is a couple of years younger than they are now. They behave like roots. Not in the Curt Kobain way, but in a cooler, relaxed but equally noisy."
0,Don't buy this...,"Purchased this alternator based on the good price, which was a terrible idea. Ran into problems getting the alternator to fit correctly, then after installation the battery light remains on. Faulty equipment. I recommend bosche. Terribly unhappy."
0,Not too good,"I decided to try a bag at a store first before buying in bulk here - man I am glad I did. I didn't really think about the ingredients too much, figuring if it was called ""all purpose flour"" it would probably work in anything - wrong! Though the texture is nice, the smell and taste completely overpower that benefit.I tried using these to make cookies, and it was horrible...way too much after taste of the bean flavor. Also, the fava bean thing kind of scares me too - apparently kids should not eat it because of possible health risks if they have certain genetic dispositions. Bob's Red Mill has some great stuff that is gluten free, but this one should be labeled as ""garbanzo/fava bean flour"", not all purpose."
1,Family Guy Rules,My mom and I love Family Guy. This just came in the mail today. Now I can watch my favorite episodes of Family Guy without having to wait for it to be on telivision. I can't wait for season three!
0,Couldn't squeeze an ounce of enjoyment from this one.,"I must agree with Dave_Gannon@msn.com regarding this ""abomination."" Reviews on the front cover called it a ""comic masterpiece"" but I found Sebastian Dangerfield a terribly depressing character with absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever. There was not a single character of which to endear me and as Gannon said I only finished the book because I have a strict policy that I finish each novel I begin hoping in this case that Mr. Donleavy was going to surprise me at the end and justify my decision to finish the book. Unfortunately the last paragraph left me frustrated and confused and feeling that maybe I should rethink my policy."
0,Bad Acting and Stolen Footage,"This movie couldn't decide if it was a soap opera set in WW II or a docudrama. Heston/ Sullivan romance adds nothing to the movie. Albert's character is winey. If you start watching the movie at the point where the American carriers leave Pearl Harbor is not a bad movie. The scenes of the air attacks on the Japanese carriers is interesting and has a degree of accuracy. Most unforgiveable and annoying thing about the movie is most of the battle on Midway Island is lifted from the attack on pearl Harbor in Tora, Tora, Tora. I know special effects were expensive but that's a trick worthy of a bad B movie."
0,False advertising!!,"The title of this book is misleading. KT does not give you one single cure for anything! He bashs the FDA for most of the book (for the most part I agree with some of his theories, but the title is not FDA: What are they hiding?, is it?...) and the last few chapters are about common sense things like eat organic foods and drink spring water. No kidding! That's the secret to healthy living??The positive reviews for this book are bogus. Anyone with common sense will not have a life-altering experience from reading this book (see above for his ""secrets"" to live a long, healthy life. Duh!). What you will have is less money in your wallet and a useless book taking up space in your house, as well as a sense of betrayal for being taken in by a con.I ordered this book from his infommercial two years ago and returned it for a refund, minus the outrageous $9.95 shipping and handling charge, of course."
0,first few weeks good only!,My mom bought this product for original price. And for the first week it worked fine but after a while it stops working and the hot water starts to drip from it and it burns. After awhile the steamer doesn't even get rid of wrinkles if.
1,comfortable,"My 13 month old seems comfortable in this car seat. I find it to be a little bit difficult to adjust the actual seat belt on the car seat. I found that the Graco infant carrier was easier to adjust. However, this had great safety ratings and that is why I chose it. The denim fabric is nice and comfortable and stays pretty cool in the warm South Florida weather. All in all a good purchase."
1,Very informative and helpful!,"I find myself using this book as a reference to help weigh and balance the best course for my individual needs. I'm glad there is a place to turn for solutions to some - not all - of the problems associated with hormones. I recommend researching your symptoms in this book, make a list, and then make an appointment with a doctor addressing your issues."
0,Awful experience,"I wish I could write my own book on calc at this moment while I'm learning it, so that I know which topics I must explain with great care, not to confuse students. This book took more pages on exercises that it did for explaining the subject. Sections are short, sometimes very short, but exercises--sometimes you'll count them up to 100(!) for just one short section! Man, what kind of reasoning is it? Everyone in the world knows that calc isn't an easy subject to learn, and yet authors do not take their time to explain topics with care.Proofs are so technical, seems like it was written by a computer, not by a human being. Authors like Stewart simply forget that not everybody understands calc the way they do, and that some students, if not all, need extra examples and explanations before they can do a bunch of exercises."
1,This review of the larger 310 page book,"As usual, the Insight Guide relies heavy on photography for a visual feel of the country, probably 40% of the book is photographs, the quality of which is good to very good. With 80 pages of Maltese history, you will get more in depth history here than with any of the other travel guides.The text does not pull any punches with discussing Malta & its people when it comes to their love of killing birds, leaving trash around, stealing car parts, overbuilding the island, being stubborn, or being horrendous drivers. But there is also an understanding and appreciation for the natives. The essays on Maltese people, their vehicles, the architecture, and superstitions are good. The last 20 pages of travel tips are helpful, the hotel recommendations adequate, the description of the various areas of interest detailed.This book is too cumbersome to take along, this is more for pre-trip research. A good book if you are heavy into the history end..."
0,If you like the Weekly World News,"You're going to love this book. My favorite nugget was where he describes sending (beaming, whatever) Gorby thoughts on ending Communism. Next thing you know they're knocking down the Berlin Wall...That he was a part of this project with the U.S. Army is not in question. That this stuff actually works, well, that's something else entirely. Funny thing about these ex-project guys - they're all trying to cash in using a failed program to give them credibility.Rather than taking money from the foil-lined hat crowd with seminars, courses, and books, why not locate Osama and pocket some real coin?"
0,Big disappointment...,"I love most OXO kitchen products, but I am tossing this one! The wire is just too loose! Somehow, I ended up with both this one and the Cuisipro around the same time. I put the OXO in our trailer, thinking that it might be tolerable for limited use. However, during our recent trip to Tillamook and Rogue River (""Cheese Land""), the decision was made to buy a second Cuisipro. Although twice as expensive, the Cusipro has kept a nice tight wire, while the OXO wire cheese slicer is so loose (even after attempted tightening) that I just decided life is too short..."
1,A fabulous and disturbing story! The best of the quartet!,"Ender's Game takes us to a future where humanity lives in fear of the alien ""Bugs"" that threaten humanity. The earth governemnt has turned to a new weapon, children. Kids begen their millitary training at as seven. Andrew ""Ender"" Wiggins is one of them. He is put through a series of grueling ""games"" pitting him against other children. If Ender loses the games, mankind may be eradicated, but if he loses, we may be the eradicators."
1,"Great toy, great price","I bought this barbie for my daughter and her friend and it is so much fun! They are still playing with it and really do love it. The camera sets the barbie apart from others so its not just a regular barbie. And you cant beat the price! Great value, great doll... you cant lose!"
1,Great wall-mount!,"I bought one from Circuit City with my TV for about $100. It was 3.5"" thick (thicker than my TV) and looked like junk. This one is higher quality, for nearly half the price. I have a 52"" Sharp LCD on it."
1,Get up and Dance!,"Pink Martini's version of ""Yolande"" is reason enough to buy this CD. Regardless of your mood when you put it in, you will be dancing around your home within 30 seconds. These guys can play!"
0,Awful,I can't describe how dangerous this was for me. After using it I made sure the knob was turned all the way off and I unscrewed it a little so it wouldn't fire off accidentally. I came back 20 minutes later and smelled something burning. the bottom plastic had COMPLETELY melted onto the wood bottom of my drawer. I couldn't touch it for 20 minutes because it was so hot. I'm surprised it didn't burn a hole in my drawer. Fire hazard product and even before it melting was very touchy and would only work if I screwed it on just enough. DO NOT GET THIS!
0,my horizontal life,This is one of the worst books i have ever read. its a book about a woman who drinks too much and is a slut. I cant see what all the excitement is about when its a woman who sleeps with anyone with a penis and if she is missing a penis she sleeps with a bottle of Ketol One. Thats a week of my life Ill never get back.
1,Credit where credit is due,"This project is an improvement over the earler released, self-titled ""Killingtons"".Due to the contributions of the actual co-writer, bass player & project engineer, Sean ""Flope"" Felcyn, the melodies & songs are stronger and JK's voice is brought out to it's full potential. But because of the unchecked ego & temper tantrums of JK & the irreconcilable differences between them, Sean's heart was broken and his name was removed from the project.If the maturity that is reflected on this CD could have made it into real life, this band could have been huge.But that's just my opinion."
0,It Bites. Literally.,"Dear Authors: if you have a number of interesting but not necessarily related ideas, take the time to flesh each one out individually in a well-plotted and well-written book. If you decide to cram them all into one short work you'll end up wih a pointless little casserole like Vittorio, the Vampire. The book starts well enough but then disintegrates; while the places are, for the most part, beautifully described, the characters are poorly drawn, the plot meanders aimlessly from pillar to post until it disappears altogether, and the various jumbled themes can't be addressed satisfactorily in a book this brief and hastily assembled. No wonder it was only $3.98."
0,Interesting But Feels Lacking,"The topics the film brings up are very thought-provoking, especially the idea of how people treat other people as objects in everyday life.The story wasn't very cohesive. After I finished viewing it, there was just this feeling of ""Really? That's it?""I don't know."
1,Love this!!!,This is so great that I just had to write a review. This has music and helps with the childs motor skills. My daughter is 3 yrs old and received this as a Christmas gift and plays with it everyday for hours. Parts have been steped on and they are very durable. I would recommend this for any 3 yr old.
0,Don't buy this game!,I bought this to play at a fun New Year's Eve party and it was NO FUN at all! It was very slow to play it and it was not entertaining in any way. We ended up playing Scattagories instead and having a blast.
0,Sizes in product description are INCORRECT,"The description says the smallest cutter has a 1.25"" diameter. It is actually well over 2"". Now I need to return these because I was looking for a much smaller cutter."
0,Not the original,The original edition is much truer to Hemingway's style. This is an editied edition from his grandson who didnt like what Hemingway originally said about his grandmother.
0,Han Will Always Shoot First - Lose New Hope Jabba,"I actually enjoy all the little backround additions GL added into the trilogy, but I just can't get by some of the major changes like Greedo Shooting first and Introducing Jabba in Star Wars.Greedo shooting first I shouldn't even have to explain.CG Jabba looks technically terrible, also a bit wimpy (seems to be getting pushed around by Han) and the build up to a great menacing creature is lost by showing him in the 1st movie.I know I can't pick and choose what to leave in and what to take out, so I would prefer to have the original movies I saw as a kid and that is where my money will go if they are ever released. If not, so be it.GL can do whatever he wants, but I personally will not be buying this on Blu Ray."
0,A Disappointment,"Initially, this book looked rather promising. Amis's stylistic touches were nice as usual and for the first hundred or so pages it seemed as though this was really building up towards an intense and revealing climax. Unfortunately, Amis failed to make the plot nearly as interesting as the setting or characters. The ending was horrid and sudden and although it appeared to say something, it really said nothing about either our condition or the mindset of the characters. All in all, an easy read with its fair share of good lines and amusing scenes, but ultimately as unsatisfying as the drugs the characters intake."
0,This Book Only Preaches to the Converted.,"This is not simple fiction, folks. It is a preaching tool for Christians to scare people into following them and their religion. Since talk of Hell doesn't seem to bother anyone anymore, propagandists LaHaye and Jenkins have used ""The Rapture"" as a contemporary way of scaring people into ""falling in line."" After all, who would possibly want to be denied the lavishness of heaven by being ""left behind?"" The authors do not wish readers to think of this as mere fiction, but as a warning for a future that they are convinced is coming.Make no mistake. This is not intended as simple science-fiction, or a light Sunday afternoon read. The intent is to convince you that if you do not follow the path that Christians follow, you will be ""Left Behind."" It's arrogant, pushy, and should be seen for what it is: A blatant, recruiting tool for Christianity using fiction and fear as their main weapon."
0,100 % Brutality,"Well, the movie itself is brilliant. Cameras, scenes, shots, actors, everybody did a great job. However, it seems to me that the movie's a little bit too brutal. In almost every shot you see somebody getting killed or somebody dead. After an hour or so, I was really bored by this movie."
1,finally have it,pretty good movie if your a John Wayne fan. amazon was the only her in Wisconsin i could get this movie from as i am working having an entire collection of John Wayne's movies and this one i have been looking for for some time now. glad i was able to find it here
1,If only I could download the data into a GIS...,"Great device. I would really like to be able to access the raw data- the readings of coordinates and time and elevation and heart rate so I could plot them as I need. I've heard of some freeware that could do this, but Garmin really should take the lead here. Also, it seems from the highly erratic speed/pace data that some smoothing is in order... a single errant point (common in GPS receivers, especially those with antennaes being waved around) can cause distortions in speed calculations. But these can be smoother out using averages over several points. Another reason I'd like access to the data. Ok, I'm a geek, but there's great information wasted here! And in the interest of full disclosure- I'm a GRMN stockholder."
0,NOT Star Trek!,"Oh, yeah, the enhanced scenery was nice, in some cases even better than the original, but for a long-time Star-Trek fan like me, this version (The Director's Edition) has one modification that totally ruined it. One of the scenes in the all important climax, the one where Decker remarks: ""But of course! We all create God in our own image."" was dropped from this version, no doubt in deference to the more pious consumers. Now this remark was not gratuitous, it was the main moral message and lesson of the entire adventure and an intrinsic aspect of the Star Trek phenomenon which made it (Star Trek) what it is today.Dropping those two lines from the movie changed it from a deeply significant work to just another shaggy-dog story. Boo! Mr. Director. I will hunt down and buy the original cut, thank you."
1,Ecocitology,The most amazing book I have ever read...life-altering look at evolutionary coexistence. There is hope for our future...with others understanding and implementing ecocity principles. Please - I challenge you to read and use the book...our way of being depends on it.
1,Great,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Interesting topic and characters that kept me engaged. A definite page turner from beginning to end.
1,Great childrens book,First read this book to my son in a Doctor's office and it was so cute that I had to go home and order it for us.
0,Beyonce or Jay Z,Beyonce doesn't do as well without Destiny's Child. All the songs are forgettable and her only hits on both CDs that I like have Jay Z in it. Beyonce needs to get back with the girls and stop depending on Jay Z.
1,A Love Story of Fate,"This movie is so wonderful. It takes you through an emotional journey. The story is about a man and woman in love that live at a lake house... just not at the same time, two years apart to be exact. They correspond through letters left in the mailbox for each other. An incredible tale unfolds about true love and perfect timing.If you enjoyed The Lake House, then I also recommend Just Like Heaven with Reese Witherspoon, another great love story of timing and fate."
0,Only worked in the garage,"Was initially excited at the clarity of this setup, but then pulled out of garage and experienced quite a bit of static. Tried a wide array of frequencies to no avail."

0,Only for the die hard Hemingway fan.,"This book, although kind spirited, is only for the die hard Hemingway fan who must read everything, true or false, about the man. I found this book to be tedious at times and sometimes just simply less than truthful. At the end I felt that the authors attempted to pull the wool over my eyes but were unsuccessful, even though I was a willing participant and wished to believe their outlandish stories. ..."
0,Nothing spectacular,"Typical compliation fare. Nothing to go run out and get (unless you are an avid ""got-to-have-everything-she-puts-out"" Madonna fan). If you are a casual listener of Madonna (like me), then I'd recommend just dubbing her songs of the radio or borrowing it from a friend. Also, on another note, why did Madonna have the audacity to remake a classic? She is on one with that. Just for butchering a classic, I give her one star. Shame, shame Madonna."
0,Boring!,This book is overly boring and really not very insightful. I think that is enought to say. Don't waste your time.
1,A new and more experienced Vivanativa,"The album is great, and the songs show they were really worked out, the packaging is a bit flimsy, but still ok. These guys can rock, everything from blues to ballads, to pop oriented tunes. They sound even better live. Lets hope sales are good and that they can do a crossover like other artistsn from Puerto Rico such as ricky martin and Puya"
0,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE!,"I own quite a few books on tattoos and body modifications, but this one just doesn't make the cut. There was nothing special about the tattoos and piercings featured in this book, you could pick up a copy of any number of tattoo magazines for under ... and see more interesting work. The photography was good for the most part, but the subject matter was lacking. If you want a really good book on this subject get a copy of The Customized Body by Ted Polhemus. Charles Gatewood also has several outstanding books on the subject.If you do decide to buy this one, make sure you save your return label, you'll probably need it."
0,BAD!!!!!!!!,"Really, be honest. This has got to be the WORST LucasArts game out there, besides the fact that they all are really horrible. The game has no real objective, besides get the bounty on an alien, while shooting five hundred others that look exactly alike. The gameplay is like a broken record.1st, you scan an alien.2nd you capture him dead or alive.3rd repeat the process for 18 levels, while being blasted by dozens of other aliens that don't die until they have about fifty red hot laser beams in them.I really fooled myself buying this without renting it first...I wasted --- dollars on a game that isn't worth two. The long and the short of it? Do not buy this game, unless you like to be driven to the nearest padded room in a white coat..."

0,Dawkins brought me out of atheism,"I would just like to thank Dawkins for ending my destructive 35 year run-in with atheism. Dawkins' stretched reasoning, poor logic, and self-refuting facts helped me see the light of God. This book is a wonderful expose of how science can degrade into the worst kind of faith. In fact this book is really nothing more than a Bible for atheists. However it advocates a faith without any kind of salvation, just meaningless living. Why doesn't Dawkins take his theory to its logical conclusion and advocate a ""might makes right"" worldview? I suppose it is because he doesn't really believe what he says..."
1,"A wonderful, magical love story","Nora Roberts has done it again. She's written a beautiful, magical love story and we all need a little magic in our lives. When I read the last page, I turned back to the first page and read the whole book again at one sitting. I had read Captivated, Entranced and Charmed, and didn't think she could outshine them but she did in Enchanted. If you haven't read any of these books, you're missing a great read."
1,Second Edition a big hit for horse owner,"Bought this for my sister, who's a new(ish) horse owner. She was disappointed at first because she already had the first edition, but then got really excited when she saw the new material included in the second edition. BTW, the pics in this book are GRAPHIC so do not purchase for a young (child) horse enthusiast."
0,"This ""kit"" is just one piece.","Linksys sells a ten-pack of the plastic wall/stack mount but this item is _not_ it. Seller will ship you just one plastic mounting bracket for this price. That wasn't what I expected, and seller processed a return and refund satisfactorily.I was able to purchase the ten-pack elsewhere for less money than the cost of this item. The ten-pack has no screws included, but does have a one-page instruction sheet that seller did not include in this ""kit.""Amazon has the ten-pack listed under item B00007FH2V"
0,Horrible,"Paul Walker returns in this sequel to 2001's The Fast and the Furious. Brian O'Conner (Walker) has left L.A due to his illegal actions from the first movie and now soars the streets of Miami making money here and there by street racing. Watched by Customs Agent Monica Fuentes (Mendes), Brian is caught by the police and is given a deal by Agent Markham and Bilkins to go undercover and try to bring down drug lord Carter Verone (Hauser)in exchange for his criminal record to be erased. Brian agrees but only if he is given permission to choose his partner. Brian heads home to Barsto, Arizona where he recruits an old friend Roman Pearce (Tyrese) to help him. Pearce agrees but only for the same deal Brian was offered. With the help of Monica, Brian and Rome work together to take down Verone. This was a horrible movie. There was no reason to make a sequel. They should have stopped after the first one."
1,An excellent hair regrowth product,"I have now used the product for about six weeks and I am more than satisfied with what I see. It is however important to mention the fact that I did combine this with biotin tablets (maximum strenght). If you have hair regrowth issues like I do, this is the best solution to use, at least based on my experience BUT at the same time combine this with biotin maximum strenght. This is what I am doing right now and getting excellent results. You get both products at AMAZON markets place at excellent prices.Thank you"
0,Supremely disappointed......,"I've been a major fan of the HP series for many years, and never acquired any of the books in hopes that they would release all of the hardcovers in a set. When I saw back in July that this set was being released I was thrilled. I just received it today, and have already filled out the return form to Amazon. I am HIGHLY disappointed. I am in the Graphics industry, and we would NEVER package something as precious as the novels themselves in something as shoddy as this faux woodgrain file box. Maybe if the publisher receives enough of these back (at $120 each), they'll get the hint. Just watch, six months from now they'll produce a REAL wooden box.... Avoid this!!!"
0,Sweet Dreams,"Proving that inspiration can strike anywhere, anytime, Claire finds hers scrawled across a bathroom wall. Urged to find a life, she takes off to find her long absent father. Shreveport no longer feels like home since her husband dumped her. However, her destination, Valentine, gives her what she was missing- surrogate relatives from parents to a pregnant teen who needs mothering herself, and an interesting man who is interested in her. Just when life has a more rosy tinge, her cheating ex realizes that she was worth holding onto and how foolish he was to let her get away, making her wonder if the way back is the way forward.Eccentrics give the novel color, much like Steel Magnolias or other Southern chick lit might have. The emails between Claire's surrogate mother and her love interest throw the narrative off a bit, however. It does, to on the positive side, have a good heart to power the story."
0,Not the Tampa Band,"Sad to say, this isn't the Tampa band I grew up with. Knew the guys. Was here when they recorded the albums, and they only had two before breaking up."
0,Compared to the real story?,You only need to read the book by Whitley Strieber to know how truly disappointing this movie is.
0,Incorrect item shipped with camera. Credit never given after item returned.,"Do not rely on Amazon recommending items to go along with previouly purchased items. I purchased a camera and Amazon recommended an entirely wrong Dock to go with it. The mistake was bad enough but when they were informed of thier mistake one would think they would have bent over backwards to correct it. To my knowledge, my credit care was never credited. I never received an apology and they tried to make it seem like their mistake was mine."
0,Oh well.,"This author and dvd is absolute trash. Anyone who believes in Christ and try's to live His teachings is a ""Christian"". I know many members of the Latter Day Saint Church, and they are wonderful good and kind people striving to bring up their families according to Christian values, loving their neighbors, serving in the community and supporting truth and virtue. Good grief, How anyone would have the gall to call them unchristian and not think that they are revealing themselves to be blind bigots as they accuse these charitable people is beyond good sense and reason."
0,DON'T BUY IT!,"If your looking for a book that can really teach you all of the specifics of the game, this is not the one to get. It is generally sparce, filled with common, unhelpful information, and redundant.Avoid this book."

1,"Great Band! New Sound! Awsome, Awesome, Awesome.","I personally had the pleasure to see the band in a small bar in Hoboken, NJ about a year ago and I knew then that they would be stars. The music is fantastic. Not since the emergence of all those bands from Seatle on the early 90's have I heard such a great band. Thay have a very unique sound. It would be unfair to compare these guys to other bands but, if you like the sounds of The Beatles, U2, Radiohead, Live and others like them, you'll definately love The Kidneythieves. The lyrics are deep, the guitar ripps, the drums rattle away like a thunderstorm and the bass is REAL GOOD! Great Sound great show, watch for these guys in the future. Get ""Tea and Apologies"" from them. It's great also."
0,Acrobat 6.0 Standard will not create fillable forms,I upgraded from Acrobat 5.0 Standard to 6.0 Standard and promptly lost the primary function which I used the program for. In 5.0 Standard you can (and in 6.0 Standard you canNOT) take a regular PDF document and create fillable blanks and checkable boxes. In order to install 6.0 you are told to uninstall 5.0. You are told not to run both on the same machine. Once I uninstalled 5.0 I lost the functionality I needed.
1,There are few who meet my standards...,"I heard Human Resource and I was blown away. There are few people who can put together a group of songs so well it makes you want to dance no matter where you are, no matter what your doing. This is the music you dance to the day after you hear it moving to the beat in your head. The musical ability of human resource far exceeds dare I say FRANKIE BONES!"
0,So misleading,I think the idea of being guided by a spirit with your wellness in mind is very appealing. This book should be filed in children's fiction. There are so many protests at this woman's events I am surprised she is still able to convince people that she has a meaningful connection to the spirit world. Especially with all the footage of her bombing on youtube.
0,What a waste of time!!!,"If it were merely poorly written as are many of her other books (and I have read them all ignoring her writing for her superior story telling ability), I could have tolertated this book. But, poorly written coupled with a ridiculous, shallow story and undeveloped characters is more than I can stomach. I have bought, read and mailed all her other books to my family in Texas to enjoy. This one will go to the recycle center."
1,Best dog bed,"This is the best dog bed, haven,t had many, but how can you improve it. You can,t. Washes really nice. Dogs love it. Fits up to 80 pound lab. If you have big dog like great Dane buy two and put them together. Funny I always had blue side up I guess it is suppose to on bottom."

0,Terminator with wings,"My title sums it up. I wanted to like this film, angels, great effects, violence and only a thread of a plot, normally I do like movies that are heavy on the action even if they only have the bare wish of a plot. This one? I kept feeling like I'd seen this story before, it had wings and angels instead of cyborg assassins from a distant future. God instead of a computer program trying to stop the resistance from happening, but at the end, it was Terminator with wings. And not done nearly as well. With the mythology to draw on, with the possible conflict available, it failed to live up to it's effects.The effects were good, but instead of being as creepy as it could have been, it was just gross in parts. The caricatured charactures kept it from ever becoming the scary look at a possible apocalypse it could have been. It just never seemed to quite make it clearly into one genre or another, and failed at all of them."
0,Worked ok for 6 weeks then wires broke near volume control,These headphones worked and sounded good for about 6 weeks. Then the wires broke internally near the volume control.

1,An Evening With Danny Kaye,"I purchased this VHS casette from AMAZON US. I liked it, my son too.We watched nearly 4 times in a last week.Quality is satisfied, sound is clean and stereo.

1,"An enjoyable, non-stop action read.","This was my first adventure into the world of Robert McCammon, and a fun one at that. The wolf's hour tells the tale of Michael Gallatin, a werewolf who is also a spy for the allies during World War II. Mr. McCammon intertwines two stories at once, the WWII part as well as the story of how Michael grew up and became a werewolf. This second story was my favorite part of the book. Mr. McCammon portrays the emotions of the characters so vividly that you can almopst feel the pain every time the ""change"" overcomes Michael and you really get a sense of the internal struggle between man and wolf. This is one of those books where suspense lurks sround every corner and the action never lets up. My only beefs are that 1)near the end, the author seems to rush the story and 2)the ending could have been a bit better. Even so, I still gave it 4 stars since the rest of the book was simply awesome."
1,A Saintly Switch,I thought this was a good family movie. I would watch it with my sons and niece and nephew. Two thumbs up.
0,Amazon Hype Sells Books,"Amazon must have a huge profit sharing deal with the author because there is no way anyone with any literary sense whatsoever at Amazon could have read this and enjoyed it. As an avid reader and amazon customer(though I will be more careful in the future) I found this book to be silly and poorly executed. I will agree that the premise is unique, but it ends there. Dig deeper in to all that amazon has to offer and don't fall for this one."

It is long, or maybe too hollow, or maybe the pace is too slow. At the same time it focusses on just one, rather small place (Lawson), and the time frame is also short . Also there are some political undertones which I could not really always understand. As to the characters, they are are not too ""live"" actually (probably due to the amnesia that stikes Peter/Luke); I was not really impressed by Peter Appleton, Harry Trimble, Irene Teriwilliger, Emmit Smith, Sandra Saint-Clair, Adele Stanton and Lucille Angström Ichtville. The only interesting part of the movie is near the end when Luke (now Mrr Appleton again), reminds us of the 5th and 1st amendments of the Constitution of the United States."
0,"Like its characters, this tale lost focus and direction","Based on the premise, I really thought I'd love this book -- and after the first few pages, I was sure I would. But it lost focus and direction. Characters were introduced and dropped -- for no apparent reason. I wasn't looking for a happy ending, but I was looking for some sense of closure. The book doesn't have any. I can only say if it was a gimmick setting up the premise for a sequel...I'm not interested."
1,The Cay,"The book ""The Cay"" took place in 1942 during World War II in the Caribbean Sea. It's about a young boy named Phillip, who gets stranded on a small cay/island in the Devil's Mouth along with an old, ugly, black man named Timothy. The main idea of the story is about their survival on the cay for several months through hurricanes and the raging sea. ""The Cay"" is a good book, but it sometimes it lost our interest."
0,not as advertisied,Ordered this and product is good quality however ad is misleading. The picture shows three snaps two on the side and one on the front . It came with only two on the side and none on the front. Next time I will call first to make sure I am getting exactly what I am paying for. With the weight of the saw I think the third snap would really help extend the life on this product.
0,piece of junk,"Most of Tandy leather's tools are junk. This is no exception. Rotating tip doesn't ensure perpendicular contact with the leather, because the locking mechanism has too much play. As a result the hole maybe crocked or misplaced. Just avoid this one and buy non-rotating punch from Osborne"
1,"Good Beginning for Object Oriented Design ""Virgins""",I borrowed this book from a co-worker a couple of weeks ago and I could not put it down. Mr. Page-Jones breaks down the concepts very plainly and succintly with excellent examples.All the sections were clear and it provides very helpful hints on designing good applications with some real world examples. I really enjoyed his sense of humor and candor throughout the book.An educational and entertaining book. A must for newbie's to object oriented design
0,Rip-off,"This is absolute offal. Not only is it a rip-off of a GOOD idea, it's not even a good rip-off.Dumb pictures, dumber captions.Up next ""Bad People""!"
1,Good bike,"I bought this bike for my wife. She assembled it. It took around 4-5 hrs. She did it alone. I was quite amazed, because i find assembling such a difficult job.There were 2 problems:-(a) Seat needed more washers. We have ordered and yet to getthem.(b) The tension was not working. After speaking with the customer service we got it fixed.I would recommend this bike to others."
1,A Turtle's Tale: Sammy's Adventures,"A Turtle's Tale: Sammy's Adventures DVD. My grand kids love this movie, age 2,4 and 6 and have watched it several times already and want to watch it more. It is a great movie to teach the kids to care for their environment and the sea life. They now have a greater understanding of why we don't throw trash on the ground or in the water. Colorful and good music too."
1,No typical boyband here!,"Although it isn't a cappella, it is still an awesome album! The CD basically lives in my player and is put on repeat! It has a lot of tight beats and smooth grooves! My cousin and I party on the road with this CD too! Although the entire album is awesome, there are a couple tunes I ""play favorites"" with. ""Love Land"" has a Jackson 5 feel to it, it really rocks! Rhythmically, ""Forgiven"" has an Alliyah/Timberland bounce to it; totally can groove. ""Everyday"" is my party song! It's one for you to put on in your car while driving with the top down and the wind blowing in your hair! Also, they did the chart ""Cherish"" and it is one of the best versions I've ever heard!"
1,Typical McKillip,"My introduction to Patricia McKillip was the ""Riddle Master"" series. At every trip to the book store thereafter, I looked for her additional works. Eventually it occured to me to try Amazon. I've collected all her books now and I've enjoyed each of them. ""Od Magic"" is, to some extent, predictable in plot but the author's fluid, graceful style makes the reading a joy. Her characters have texture and complexity even though they seem to follow a formula.After you've read a few of McKillip's works you'll find few surprises in the rest of her collection. However, during those times when you read just for pleasure, you really don't want surprises. McKillip never disappoints."
0,Doesn't quite fit,"It has all the right features. It looks just like the picture. I love that I don't have to remove the camera from the cover to take a picture, but the openings for the controls don't *quite* line up. The LCD cover is a hard, clear, plastic piece that floats over the screen and is not connected to the rest of the camera cover. I wouldn't buy it again."
1,Great product,This is a great product at a great price. Have been using them for years and worked with the sulfer taste you get with Florida water
1,cant beat that price,"Just recieved my G4 Ibook recently and I can honestly say I love it! im a college student and my pc laptops kept freezing and crashing nonstop! and I really wanted a mac but I didnt have the ""mac"" money or so I thought. This is my first mac and its life saver! for less than $300 dollars you can have a portable mac that does everything a $1000+ new mac does ( minus the camera)... It does get warm but that isnt a real big issue with me...as far as battery life it doesnt seem to be the greatest, in my case it isnt a problem because I intend on having my charger with me. I think people should consider this computer as a start mac."
0,Disappointing...,"I have struggled to get along with my boyfriend's parents for the past year and, having read the positive reviews on the cover, had strong hopes that this book would offer some insight into how I could make things better with them.I think that calling this book a ""how-to"" guide is misleading. This is mainly a collection of anecdotes from a variety of ""in-laws"". About 70% of these stories are about positive in-law relationships. The author merely strings these stories together and at the end of each chapter offers a small paragraph or two of vaguely-defined, common-sense suggestions.If you are looking for some real life stories that you can relate to, you may enjoy this book. But if you are having real difficulties with your in-laws or prospective in-laws, this book offers little solid advice or insight."
1,Sci-fi-martial arts,"To be honest I much prefer seeing Jet Li kicking ... in a more ancient China setting (ie. ""Twin Warriors""). I must also add that I'm not a Sci-fi fan however Jet Li being the martial artist that he is won me over. He plays a double role of good guy vs. bad guy. Although he was a bad guy in Lethal Weapon 4 the brand he portrayed in ""The One"" is much different and shows another side of Jet Li's talents. If you enjoy seeing him kick ... then you'll enjoy watching ""The One"""
0,Shocking,"I read this book about a month ago and I'm still in shock at how terrible it was. I normally don't critique people's writing styles but come on, this was so horribly written that I could barely finish it. I can't believe it was actually published...and even more that some people like it. Also, I think the author is a little out of touch with the younger generation-what kind of high school party plays Celine Dion music? Really. I actually don't ever write reviews on books either but this was so terrible I felt compelled to save someone from wasting their money."
1,Great Catholic Guide,"I really enjoyed this book. It contains lots of information about Catholic homeschooling, organization and discipline. I found the book very informative as well as inspiring. It motivated me to try to be a better Catholic especially for the sake of being a good example for my children."
0,A MUSIC FAN FROM NEW YORK,I think the album was poor only one song is good in the album I perfer the second album
0,"Lost sync with dongle frequently, stopped working completely after 18 months","I like this keyboard... when it works. I'm not a heavy user, and yet it would stop working every couple of months or so. By trial and error I figured out that to revive it, I needed to remove the batteries, wait a few seconds and put them back in, then re-sync. Then finally it seems to have completely failed just now, after about 18 months. I can't revive it anymore. I find it unacceptable for modern electronics to fail so quickly."
1,First in the Series...,"The House of the Dead (sometimes called Curien Mansion) series is amazingly awesome. Although this game is simple and graphic, every Saturn owner should have it, and if you own the Stunner or Light Gun for the Saturn, it just makes the experience more awesome! Warning: It's hard to find for a decent price, and they didn't make any remake like they did for the second one and the third one. This is the only version you can find of House of the Dead. Although it's a great game, it's not worth $50, so don't fall for the pricey claims."
1,Literature and Entertainment!!!!!,"This book possesses something very rare: the ability to entertain as well as just about any Agathe Christie book along with a wildly rich variety of diction, intrigue, and (though the author denies it in his prologue) meaning. I have read it three times and each time I chuckle over some droll detail I missed on my last reading. Moreover, a great introduction to Nabokov: Ada and Pale Fire require much more cerebral work, and unlike Despair, don't lend themselves as easily to being happily re-read - something pretty much required if Nabokov can begin to be truly appreciated, as his stylings are difficult. A wild romp that will particularly be appreciated by worshippers of Dostoevsky and Pushkin, as critical extensions of some of their work are oddly offered (and strangely juxtaposed)as well. A solid, muscular masterpiece that makes much of Lolita look tame."
1,Overall good information...,"Dr. Vanheemst does a great job giving the facts to the situation. The first couple of chapters are a list of facts it seems, but he makes a lot of good points in the midst of them. Overall, its a good read if you are interested in school choice."
0,"Gorgeous box, however doesn't work","I cannot say enough about how nice the Steinhausen looks. It was also packed extremely well. Unfortunately, despite trying every mode of operation that each winder has, the winder failed to keep any of my eight watches wound. Within three days every watch had stopped. When I contacted the customer service number for Steinhausen (which takes you to GadgetUninverse), they were less than helpful.This is another case of you get what you pay for. Stick with other brands if you want your watches to stay wound. However, if you just want a nice jewelry box, you might consider this piece."
1,Spiritual Journey,Babette's Feast is a glowing spiritual journey as expressed through food and gratitude.
1,All around great bag - high quality,The dual compartments and front accessible opening were very well designed. The overall quality of the bag is also worthy of praise; very tough and the wheels glide effortlessly. Great product.
1,Great Movie,This was a great movie.The price was a good value also.Service was great an all around good experience with purchase.
0,Crack too easy for the price,I bought two of these glasses to drink the odd bottle of wine with my wife. One of the glasses cracked in the dishwasher. I won't buy any more at $25 a pair if they are so fragile.
0,Tried to grow twice with zero success.,"We followed the directions on the first disc and got nothing. So, we reread and followed them meticulously again. This time it sprouted, but just sort of got stuck at that stage. I wish I knew what we did wrong. I'm glad it didn't set me back too much."
0,Don't buy this,This is a cheap and poorly made item. Instead of advertising this bulb they should spend the money improving the product.
1,Great solid headphones,"I purchased these for my friend after his broke. I dont know much about headsets but from the reviews these seemed like the best for abour $100. He said they work great, and doesn't have any complaints. It's been 6 months and they work like the day I got them."
0,Not Worth the Price,"On Amazon this book will set you back nearly 15 dollars (that includes shipping and handling). And what do you get for that 15 dollars? Not a whole lot. I knew I was in trouble with this book when I noticed in the table of contents that there was an entire chapter devoted to ""How to Buy a Computer"". Maybe the author should've gone all the way back to ""Ways to make money to Buy your own Computer"". To be fair, the book does offer specific links regarding web page design and affiliates, but you can get that by going to Yahoo, for free. Save your 15 bucks."
1,A comprehensive look at the most dominant team in history.,"I think that last years video has more dramatics and excitement, but this year's does a good job of showing the team in a less exciting and more challenging role of being the favorite to win it all. It's all there, the great running of Terrell Davis, Elway magic, Shanahan's genius. There is no better way to remember the fantastic season than with this video."
1,back in the day,"In the days of early fusion few pioneers were as capable as Mr. cobham,you could could argue norman conners,alphonse mouzon were the ones ,but Billy is the best. Spectrum is as the name implies, a full spectrum of a very ,very talentd musician. Check out; anxiety.le lis,snoopys search, and red baron. SPECTRUM is great!!! buy it"

1,Rock On Elton,"What a great, rocking record! I dusted off the CD this week and gave it a spin. Great tunes...""Hard Luck Story,"" ""Yell Help Medley,"" ""Grow Some Funk Of Your Own,"" ""Dan Dare,""..all great tunes.This record has aged very well. Unfortunately, it was panned when it came out. Perhaps they were looking for a profound statement. Elton just wanted to rock!!Buy this now!!"
0,Dissapointed,"We expected dimensional man to be well, more dimensional.My husband is a teacher and bought this as a teaching tool. This would be more useful if you could access the layers better and if it had a back view also. He doesn't have a vertebrae under his layers and the access to look at the heart is limited an awkward. There isn't a brain in the skull to view either. Over all very disappointed. Dimensional man will probably end up being a very expensive Halloween decoration."
0,DEFECTIVE OUT OF THE BOX,After wasting a couple of hours with D-link techs. finally determined unit was defective. Amazon was great about how painless they made the return.
1,Brandon Jenkins - 5 Stars,"Yea to the Tulsa boy. He is down home and truly raw - Country- Blues - Has a definate ""sound"" You should give it a try. Writes and sings about ""REAL"" life. Not the stereo-type BS songs we're all tired of. A breath of fresh air. He should do well if the real people snag him and carry him to where he should go!Ray"
0,Not worth the money,Very slow print speed and poor print quality. And the size was not that much smaller than other ink jet printers.
0,No Way....,"No way to buy this pack of rather mediocre cartoons without the opening and bumpers.I'd rather buy the ""credits"" with out the cartoons,they were the best part of the show.Let's boycott it."
0,"Amazing sound, faulty unit","I love the sound signature but they are bass anemic, something I had read pros and cons about but my main concern is that one side is considerably louder than the other, this is unacceptable from a respected and trusted company as AT.For the kind of money these cost I would expect a better quality control."
1,Great product would buy again,"Great product would buy again, took a bit of a long time to arrive, I had forgotten about it, but when it got here I was very happy with the product itself. I use it everyday in my hair products"
1,Disney,As a fan of Disney animation This was one movie I'd not seen. It is a typical animation from this period of time. I really enjoy hand drawn animation. With Henry Mancini doing the score and Vincent Price as one of the voices I thought it might be a good watch. The story is not as engaging or as strong but the movie holds together well. What you would expect from Disney.
0,very disappointed.,"This thing tastes like it has fermented and it was left a little bit longer it would turn into a local wine. I am surprised people who already used this product recommended this product with good things to say about the taste. Believe me if I were to choose between this one and a bitter Melon, I would go for the later one. We had guests over the day we received this product and offered it to them. They were like what the hell is this. One sip and one of them was ready to vomit. I am just wondering now if I should even look at amazon reviews because this is a second instance where i was disappointed by trusting the reviews. I would guess it was the problem with the batch i received or something had changed in this product to not to match the review I read here."
0,You Will Cringe,Buyer beware...make sure and listen to the music clips before purchasing this item. The only thing classic are the titles.
1,Fun Read,"""Something Borrowed"" is the tale of Rachel: dutiful daughter, loyal best friend, kick ass laywer who happens to realize she's in love with her best friend's fiance. Obviously anyone reading this has already read the synopsis, so I won't bore you with that AGAIN. The one thing that I want to impress upon anyone considering this book is JUST DO IT. It is well written, the characters are well developed and fun, and you will not be able to put it down! Great to take to the beach or on vacation. I'm currently reading the sequel (""Something Blue"") and it is equally as fun so far! Looking forward to checking out Giffin's other books as well!"
0,Disappointed,"I purchased this set because the idea of a countersink, with a correctly sized tapered pilot hole in one step seems like a time saver. The set delivers on these points as long as you don't need to move the countersink towards the tip to accommodate a shorter screw. The set screws that hold the countersink in place have very little to take purchase on when it is moved onto the flutes of the drill bit. Thus, the countersink has both slipped and wobbled. This set will go in the trash when I receive the 3pc Pro Countersink Set from Rockler. This system uses a much longer sleeve between the countersink and the drill bit allowing you to move the drill within the sleeve and having adequate purchase for the set screws of the countersink."
0,Prejudice,Writers have prejudice against Maalaea Bay area. Reading the description of that area you think that every day is cane field ashes and high winds. The Trade Winds vary in strength and we are blessed with natural air conditioning.The cane fields in Kihei and other locales are burned as needed very early in the morning. Varying amounts of ash floats on the winds. No burning in the care fields next to Maalaea Village.
0,Beef,"Beef 1 is the best one of the 4,the only reason worth watching is Pac',all the rest is just post-1996(Rap Game is Dead)malarkey,Biggie,G a y -Z, flab boy,mobb sleep are all whack, East Coast Rap unless it's 80s or BDI and Bootcamp Clik/SmiffnWessum it doesn't matter, And all these so-called ""Positive Rappers"" as Willie D once said Positivity ain't getting nobody paid. All these back-packers read Fake muslims(Nation of Islam is a Radical Communist Sect-yet they have an monopoly on bean pies and providing security for the industry,ironically the suspect last seen around BIG was an Bowtie wearing ""Peaceful"" follower.) The only ones worth listening to Yukmouth,Scarface,Willie D,Dru Down,E-40,Bone,Spice 1,GrandMaster Flash,Big Daddy Kane,but all these others are all over rated,Krs-one is one self centered sucka MC.Backpackers or bling rap is still dead."
0,Still waiting for the game,"Not sure if we like this game or not as we ordered on on November 19th, and as of today, December 23rd it has not shipped. This has happened to me before with pre-ordered stuff so I would be really cautious if you want something for a gift when you order from Amazon. In reading the other reviews it looks like this has happened to other people. Better buy it at the store, so you can be sure you get it when you need it. I thought over a month was plenty of time to receive it, but I guess I was wrong."
0,"If you LOVED ""Love Actually""...","then you probably won't be impressed by this film. Sure, Bill Nighy is fab, as usual, as is Kelly MacDonald, but it's pretty hard to swallow their random relationship. It's also hard to believe that she could so easily infiltrate the G8 Summit. There are several sweet moments, but they're just as implausible.SEMI-SPOILER:Why exactly does she kiss him when she does? I don't buy it.I'm a fan of movies with a point, but it just doesn't work. Sorry, folks."
1,Excellent,This is the best Playboy video I have seen! Excellent quality. Well worth the money. Jodi Ann Paterson is incredible!
1,Great depiction of navy seals,I'm not a seal but can believe that this movie is the closest to how the operate in theater. Pretty basic plot but the details are great
0,poor quality,Had trouble assembling the product out of the box. Then realized they packed two left upper arms and two left legs so there was no way to get it to work. After we had the right pieces it was still hard to get it together. After assembly it's not very straight and we need to prop it up. Wouldn't get this again.
1,A good climbing DVD on the subject,"I've got no complaints really. I got what I wanted, which was a proper documentary on Eiger North Face. Highly recommended!"
1,Holy $h!%,"Those were the first words out of my mouth after listening to the 2nd track, Revolution Deathsquad.I'm a fan of other power metal bands like Iced Earth, and mostly progressive metal such as Dream Theater and Symphony X. I had heard abuot Dragonforce but never really gave it much thought. Then I saw this little beauty and in an impulse buy snatched it up. And boy am I glad I ever did.The amazing intensity just smacks you in the face, and boy this is some solid stuff. I love the speed, and it's not just mindless speed, it all has some sort of musicality in terms of the actual song which makes it 20x better.Without a doubt pick this up if you are any sort of fan of Power/Speed/Guitar in general and you will not be disappointed.I'm off to go purchase Dragonforce's other two albums!"
0,Needs Improvement,"What can you say about a $99.95 Power Washer? Needs Improvement.Unlike the other reviews, I utilized this Pressure Washer for several projects...Deck Washing, Pool Liner, Concrete Driveway and also borrowed to my neighbors for their projects. Combined over 100 Hours of Use. The only Flaw is the connection of the extension wand to the spray nozzle. My unit unfortunately broke in this location, replacement not available.. I even tried a J-B Weld Epoxy repair and secured with #8 Screws Directly to the Extension Wand. When &quot;Pressured Up&quot; the connection let go! As a low cost intro level Power Washer, you will get your usage BUT Don't abuse by dropping the Wand or use adversely."
1,Very Nice,"The shoes are very good quality.Perfect and moreover a comfortable fit.Monk strap looks slick for a pair of shoes to go to work with.Unlisted uses good quality material.This seller shipped it really quick,Thanks"
0,This review is for the audio version.,"I absolutely love the story ""The Birds"" and was so excited when I found there was an audio CD version of it. Little did I know this version wasn't an unabridged reading--not even an abridged reading, it was rubbish that was painful to the ears.In this audio version there about 4 or 5 people, some male, some female, and after every sentence one of them read, overlapping the other. So it goes something like this:Guy: [The guy sat there looking at the birds]Now, as soon as he started saying ""birds"" a female would kick in with the next sentence.Female: [the birds were acting strange]then another guythen somebody elseTHE WHOLE WAY THROUGH!It was so bad, after listening to less than 2 minutes of it, I packed it up, and sent it back. Something that awful shouldn't be on the market. Especially when it's being done to such a fantastic story."
1,He'sDoneItAgain,"Yep, Kem Nunn has produced yet another winner. I've just finished this one, and I loved it again. He is a writer who can give his characters depth, and give his story-line meaning. A thoroughly good read once again. I'll be hunting the pages of Amazon.com for his next title."
1,It came broken,The stone came broken. Packaging was the problem. I was sent a replacement at no cost. It works great! I would have given it 5 stars if the first one were packaged right and not broken.
0,This album was pretty bad.,"I thought that this album would be excellent after the thrilling Titanic album. Unfortunately this had ""other"" music in it, and I really didn't enjoy it one bit. People, don't buy this album, it is much better buying the first one, which is terrific."
1,one of the best,This is the first of Doreen Virtue's books that I have read. I will definitly be reading her other books. This is probably the best angel book I've read to date and I would recomend it to anyone who is interseted in angels.
1,An Education in Journalism,"Talese's masterpiece has stood the test of time since its publication in 1969. Far from boring, the content is fresh and the style is flawless. The excitement of working at the NEW YORK TIMES comes through nearly every page. What also comes through is the standard of excellence, something that the TIMES has struggled with in recent decades."
1,"same book, different author?","I have had this book for a number of years - it's on my keeper shelf, and probably is rising again to the top of the re-reads~BUT MY copy, 1994, of ""Shields of Pride"" has Elizabeth Chadwick as the author of this Ballantine/Random publ. book - was this first done as a pseudonym? or is the name ""Chadwick"" the pseudonym?? or is this a mistake - however, to paraphrase, ""a book by any other author"" remains a good read."
0,Tedious!,"Dickens has very beautiful prose, however no amount of poetry would make this a good book. I kept reading because I continued to hope that the story would eventually become interesting, and it took about 60% of the way through before anything substantial happened. Yet even then, I wasn't impressed. Some of the key characters were not sufficiently developed, so the ending lost some of its impact. B-O-R-I-N-G."
0,a big disappointment,"This book should probably be called ""gated communities"" rather than ""hidden homes"" - the homes photographed are the super-expensive vacation retreats of people who only live in the area periodically. These interiors are the work of professional designers, static ""museum spaces"" for the art collections of movie producers and ex-fashion models. The book is sadly lacking in the integrity and spirit of the people who actually live in the area, where a distinctive architectural and decorative style has evolved over thousands of years of human habitation.It would be a pleasure to see a book about northern New Mexico houses that are designed, built, or lovingly restored by people who actually live in the area."
0,"Nice back brush, but it's turning black with mold","I've used many back brushes over the years. This one is very nice and has very soft bristles. But the wood in the head of the brush is turning black with mold. Also turning black where the bristles attach to the brush. Gross. I've only had it about a month. I hang it in the same place as all the other brushes I've had, but no others have ever turned black."
0,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"Nirvana kicks ass, but this cd blows it. The reason i gave 2 stars is because i liked about 10 seconds of the album."
0,Very Disappointed,"I enjoyed his first album, so I thought I would be loyal and give this one a try. I will not lie and tell someone to spend money on this one. Only 2 or 3 tracks hit hard and right away."
0,Does not glow in the dark - terrible ball all around,"I am really dissapointed by this soccer ball. Firstly it does not glow at all. My regular white soccer balls are actually easier to play with in the dark than this ball because its actually very hard to see in the dark. Not only that but the ball only lasted for about 3-4 weeks of semi regular soccer practice. After about a month it started getting ""eggs"" as my friend calls it. Basically it is little bubbles on the ball. It got to the point it wouldnt roll but randomly bounce around because of the eggs. Yesterday I finally lost the ball playing street soccer. Didnt even care."
0,Im done with this show.,"Season 1: great show, captured my imagination, actually made me devote myself to fun, exciting television. Season 2: Lackluster, brought back characters I thought had died with great impact and import in season 1, halfway through the season I started skipping shows, moved onto other prime-time shows that were better written and acted. Season 3: Yawn, what happened to this show?!? Seriously, the most disappointing season of a seriously faltering show. If this show continues on this path I predict cancellation after the next season."
1,EXCELLENT!,"I absolutely love these vitamins! My menopausal symptoms weren't that extreme, but since taking these capsules I don't have any noticeable symptoms at all. Great product!"
1,Big Improvement!,"Have the original boxwave stylus. It worked but I never loved it. The tip was squishy and i had to write fairly big. As soon as I tried this new version, I knew it was a huge improvement. While the tip is soft, it doesn't drag the way the original did. I can write with a light touch and the size is ""normal."" like the options for attaching it to my iPad, too, so it is there when I need to use it."
1,Chariots of Fire,Enjoyed this movie very much when first seen on the big screen and had been wanting to view it again. Outstanding film and of course excellent music. Larry
1,Great for asparagus,"Just what I needed to serve asparagus, I was always looking for what serving spoon or fort to use but this work just perfect and I'm sure I'll think of a lot of other uses for them."
0,Poor,"I didn't like this movie much. It was allegedly a kid's movie, which we showed it to my 4 year old. Maybe it was too old for him, and too juvenile for my wife and I. Stupid story line, bad acting."
1,What a fantastic book !!!!,"If you are a great Joy Division fan then this book is a must for you. I have read it three times and every time I read it, I think I'm with the band back in those days from '77 until'80. It's written fantastically. More about Ian Curtis as a person than as a musician. This is why the book is so fantastic. Read it and read it again and again and..."

1,"Dark Angel, savior of tomorrow","Somebody needs to do this show over, even if Jessica Alba is not in it, though that would be nice. A movie with her in it would also be nice. Just don't mess up the story!One of the best shows ever made. If you like action, stunts, combat, sci-fi, alternate realities, near-future realities, post apocalyptic futures, etc... then this is for you. If you like Soap Operas, then this is probably not for you, but they get 0/5 stars, while this one gets 5/5, so go figure.Jessica Alba kicks ***. Nuff said. However, she does most all of her own stunts and sends several actors and stuntmen to the hospital in the name of good TV.Just buy it!"
1,Effective book about hygiene for young children,"We like how this book is very straight forward and to the point about hygiene education. Sharing this book during class discussions about germs, hand washing, sneezing and other infection control topics can be a big help. Germs Are Not For Sharing is a good asset to have when there is an outbreak. Keep this book handy and share with your students whenever possible. It is also highly recommended to pair this book with a hygiene activity that SHOWS the principles found within the reading.OUTFOXOUTFOXprevention.com"
1,Great watch for the price,This is a great watch. The only complaint that I have is that the battery died not too long after I bought the watch.
1,Best book I have read in some time,"I have rarely read a book completely in one sitting, but I couldn't put this one down. The author is a very good story teller. I look forward to the next book outing for Mr. Miletich."
1,"Crappy, but classic films!","I remember watching these movies when I was a kid, renting them through the local video store. Seeing them available online brought back memories so I had to buy them. Although being laughably bad, watching them again was enjoyable, shipping was quick, no complaints."
0,WHAT?,How can there be an influences record for Sarah McLachlan without any Joan Biaz. The woman her mother listened to all the time and made her want to become a singer?
0,Not worth the price tag,"I bought this for my daughter when she was about 3 months old and thought it would be good for tummy time. I picked this specific mirror over other (cheaper) ones because it said on the box that it can stand on its own, but it constantly toppled over. The talking was also a bit too startling for my baby (it is very loud and there is no volume control). I ended up returning it."
1,A must read for every Wicaan!,"I put off reading this book because although I heard about how important and influencial it was for Neo-Paganism, there were many complaints about rampant sexism and politics.I wish I had ignored the negitive reviews and read this book much sooner. It was so beautiful and it really inspired me! I can understand how this book started so many covens and brought so many people to the Goddess.Read this book, and read the updated footnotes. Yes, some of her history has been proven untrue, but she owns up to it in the updated edition. If you are a Pagan of any tradition, this is a must read book!!"
1,Great toiletry bag,"Perfect size, nice design, ideal for frequent travellers. It is also large enough for everything and has plenty of waterproof compartments."
1,Awesome book!,"A compelling and wrenchingly honest first-hand account of slavery, manytimes breaking my heart and making me think of the children of Africatoday. A new book, ""The Last Witness From a Dirt Road"" which takesplace in 1946, was given to me after commenting about Solomon Northup'snarrative, and it could almost be a sequel to Twelve Years a Slave,written a 100 years later by the son of an overseer on a plantationalong the banks of Bayou Bouef in the same location in Louisiana. Oldsocial and economic orders seemed little changed from 1841 to 1946,tragic, heart rendering but both books are riveting and honest, aretimely and universal."
1,not for the younger toddler,"I started really urine training my daughter at 17 months (and had her doing BM on the toilet at a year). While this book had tons of information for the later trainer, there was not much at all for the younger child, other than the typical list of ""readiness signs"". I still give it four stars because if my daughter were maybe 3 or 4 years old, this book would be invaluable. There is lots of information on how to motivate an older child, how to deal with particular problems and temporary setbacks, etc. It does not give one definite ""way"" to train, but rather suggests many possible routes along the way and emphasizes that each child is different and will be more or less successful depending on the route. If you're starting at an earlier age, I'd look somewhere else. My child has all the readiness signs, but is not old enough to be motivated by ""pretty panties"" or ""friends at preschool"", nor is old enough to give me major temper tantrums or refusal to go."
0,Undead and Board,"I was really looking forward to this book comming out,i really wanted it to pull my attention back as i thought the last one was lacking something (a real Plot). All the right elements where going to be there, zombies, unknown european vampires, and a friend with a possible incurable illness. However the polt just did not deliver for me.Sorry MJD but you just aren`t grabbing my attention, and i loved the first three books.Betsy just seems to be going no where in the last two books, no character developement no suspence no anything. Lets have a few more pages for our money and lets see an enemy thats worth fighting , and lets have our Betsy do the fighting insted of some one else!!!"
1,When Todd met Tubes; Call it UTUBIA!,"Recommended for fans of Todd Rundgren's power pop soul (with hints of Prog instrumentalism) and for fans of the Tubes high concept rock showism. Basically a concept album about TV, in a Tommy like reactionary tale of brain drain and ultimate consumption. But with great hummable tunes and cheeky lyrics. Standout tracks include ""Turn Me On"",""TV Is King"" and the almost punk rockish ""Telecide"". Funny but not goofy, intense but not pretentious, Remote Control is a secret fave now back on CD. Yeah.Paul MyersBerkeley"
1,Great for stopping hair loss,"My wife and I live in Chicago and had been experiencing severe hair loss, and had tried several home remedies of eating healthy, applying oils/ointments but nothing worked. Finally someone suggested this and it works like a miracle. Our hair loss has stopped and hair have strengthened. Too bad we didn't know about this earlier and I Lteady lost half my hair."
0,Someone slam the lid shut please!,Listening to these songs is like sitting in a hotel bar and listening to some really bad piano player destroy wonderful songs with truely tasteless vamping. Absolutely awful arrangements. Several of the songs were primarly piano solos and there was nothing wrong with the original arrangement but he couldn't leave well enough alone.
1,It was really good.,"I bought this to use it for both my mobile and laptop. When using for my mobile, i find it very very useful and it is clear too. But, i have issues while trying to pair it with my laptop. It doesn't pair with my laptop so easily. But, still it is really good if you are trying for a good headset at a very reasonable cost."
1,Handy,"I bought this as a spare to travel with and to sync at home. I leave my other cable at work.Pro:-Standard USB plug so it doesn't crowd out other plugs in our computer or our 4-port hub-Built in ""sync"" button on the end that attaches to the Palm is handy-Firm connection to the palm-Good cable lengthCon:-Black connector hard to see, would like a gray or white option-No cover for the palm connection end, be wary of damaging the exposed pinsBottom line: recommended."
0,boring and depressing,"awful book. even ms. keyes said writing this book was 87% depressing. if the author knows its depressing while shes writing it, then WHY would she think the public would like it? I guess i am simply not a fan of Ms. Keyes writing style because i did not like Watermelon either. This book probably brought me to my mental breakdown."
0,Smells... SO BAD,"Did not like this product! I got the jar out, red the directions, opened up the bottle, and about died from the odor. It reminded me of the latrine at girl scout camp, it was that bad. The brush did not look soft (the bristles were bent all weird), nut I needed to get rid of the hair so I put it on anyway. Bad idea. I had to sit with the awful smell under my nose for three minutes. I finally got to wipe it off and the hair was gone, so I figured that was that. Then it started to burn and turn bright red. I am not happy. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
1,"A Book full of wonder, beauty and the fantastical","This book is one of the best I have ever read. I've read it and re-read it many times!The sheer beauty displayed in this book is astounding.It holds your attention the whole way through. It's a fantastical journey through a mysterious land. Very, very highly recommended."
0,"Impactante,frío,muy duro,.....EXCELENTE.","Cruel definición de la sociedad clasista norteamericana.Donde el dinero,las ""marcas"",y el poder es lo único que importa. Además el sadismo descrito en los crímenes de Bateman es inigualable."
0,Cheap,"The sound quality is good, but unfortunately they are extremely uncomfortable after about an hour because there is no padding on the top strap. Also, mine straight up stopped working after less than a year."
1,One of my favorite scifi books,"I found this vision of a future world for humanity to be intriguing, if not entirely believable. I just don't think that many people would be satisfied with a life of so few choices. Yes, I understand his theory that ""artificial selection"" by years of living in Urbmons would weed out people who dream of something more to life than reproduction, who question the status quo, who long to explore the outside world. I just think he underestimates how MANY people would be dissatisfied with this superficial society, and that they would get together and conspire to cause a revolution. Still, it was very well written and entertaining, and made me think long and hard, which any good book will do."
0,My little guy finds them uncomfortable,These run small and like I said my little guy finds them uncomfortable and fights me over putting them on. They also tear easily.
0,READ THE FINE PRINT!!!!!!!!!!,"we were sold a lexmark print trio, that was supposed to have ink included in it, it even states on the box, ""ink included"". it is too bad that now a days you cannot get what you pay for. what do you people do, open a new box and take the ink out, and then sell it too. poor business if you ask me. I miss the old days when you got what you payed for by honest business people. I also see on other peoples comments that the printer is being sold as ""new"" and is instead used merchandise."
0,Battery Eater,"My mom bouth this toy for my son. The music portion of the mobile is fine. Plays classical & lullaby music. At night you can see the stars on top of the ceiling which we loved. However, the mobile moves so slow that you have to look closly to see if it is actually moving. And the whole unit eats batteries like crazy. I only used to about two months and had to change the batteries about 6 times. Even with fresh batteries sometimes the music won't play, or the light for the stars wouldn't come on. I highly suggest not buying this product. In fact, the next time I'm in a city that has toy-r-us, i will be returning it."
1,Honeywell Air Purifier,"This air purifier is effective and quiet, My husband and I are very satisfied with this product. I highly recommend this air purifier."
0,"for the ""special needs"" student","This is used in my local high school and is geared for the student who never faced a foreign language before. It travels, like a desert caravan, at the speed of the slowest. Lots of repetition, lots of drills, and lengthy explanations of things that are obvious to anybody who has EVER studied a language. If you have always been totally lost in grammar class but have some life-threatening need to learn Arabic even if it's very slowly, this course is for you."
0,Too many tangents,"The book starts like gang busters and grabs your attention. Then, as you keep reading chapter after chapter, Coben goes off on tangents that quite frankly don't add a lot to the story. I found myself doing a lot of skimming to get back to the story of Matt and Olivia. In the end, the story comes to a good conclusion. But getting there -- took a lot of patience. I would not read it again knowing what I know now."
1,Awesome!,I brought this for my son-in-law for Christmas. 2 days later we had our first winter storm and received 8 inches of heavy snow. He kept up with the snow fall and we had a clear driveway and walkways. He absolutely loves it and it works better than anticipated!!!!
1,Beautiful,"I'm very happy with my new bread box. It's beautiful, holds a lot and looks great on my countertop. It arrived at the specified time and was in perfect condition."
1,BACKYARD CRIMINALS RULES!,This is a great DVD if you love pro wrestling or if you love backyard wrestling. The wrestlers will also say a lot of great things about Backyard Wrestling that you wouldn't expect to hear.
1,SOOOO CUTE,"I bought this more for decoration than function, but when I opened the package not only did it spring to life, it was so much larger than expected, I was pleasantly surprized. Currently its a hamper but later I will keep it for toy storage. Soooo cute!!!"
0,CA870,"Very Very Very terrible air soft gun. I bought this for my son and 3 weeks later it broke! The laser batteries runs out quick, and its made of some cheap plastic. I would NOT buy this product."
0,"Margaret, Australia","I found this book, so boring and predictable. The charactors were so unbelievable that I don't know why I continued reading the book. The plot, was not too bad, but if you can believe a man who is bashed, stabbed then spends hours searching and tracking his wife is then able to satisfy his wife sexually etc , etc, then I would like to meet this superman. The book spent too much time in sexual writings, which doesn't even fire the imagination. Just say this book is a waste of good reading time, as this is the first book of hers that I have read, I would have second thoughts in ever choosing another of her books"
0,Go back to school,"No reputable historian ever uses the term ""Dark Ages"" since this is an inaccurate and pejorative term for a period in which art and learning were thriving in Byzantium and many places in western Europe (Ireland, for instance). Moreover, anyone who places Van Eyck in the Middle Ages is simply an ignoramous and should not be passing him/herself off as an expert on any aspect of history. It may be that these errors do not occur within the DVD under review, but are merely the gaffes of whoever wrote the ""editorial review"". I haven't actually seen ""Landmarks of Western Art"" and the review does not encourage me to do so. I guess this might disqualify me from writing a review, but after all, this is Amazon.com-- since when do reviews have to be written by people who've actually seen the product?! Just check out books by writers like Kate O'Beirne, whose work has been subject to a massive free-for-all of mud-slinging from people who clearly have never read a word of it."
1,Must read...Amazing!,It was one of the best days of the year after I got this set for $34 at Sam's Club the minute they marked it down! There was chaos in the store to get this set...women taking the display model to get this deal!! Never been more happy in my life.
0,What a load of garbage,"COOMPARE THIS BOOK TO TOLKIEN? SHAKESPEAR? Tolkiens series was literally a work of art, While this book isn't fit to, uhh.... something really bad. How can you even consider comparing this book to the artistry of tolkiens masterpiece? Now don't get me wrong, I didnt particularly like the lord of the rings series, but I recognize talent when I see it, and this is not talent. this is sophomoric and boring. WHAT A LOAD OF GARBAGE!"
1,Brief but WORD full,"You do not need the Day by Day Kid's Bible - BUT - we love that too so with that said - we are enjoying reading the Word (sWord,) memorizing a key sWord verse each week, and then doing some of the activities it suggests. Our children at home are 14, 13 and 8 so it brings some good discussion about how to use the sWord."
0,Disappointed,Still havnt received my book!! Supposed to revive it October 22 it's now nov 12. Not to impressed with this websit taking my money & not giving me the product I paid for ?!
0,"Part 4, shopworn and formulaic.","My big quibble with Soul Harvest was just how closely it followed the event outline of Nicolae. Buck saves Chloe from harm, then runs off to save someone else. Meanwhile Rayford continues to spy on Nicolae and seek out the newly saved. The intrigue heats up and the nastier bits of the tribulation are yet to come, but did Jenkins have to gloss over plagues in mere paragraphs? And just how long is he going to drag these events out? Questions I would not be asking if he spent more time developing three dimensional and complex characters to inhabit this hellish world. I wasn't exactly bored with the novel, but I was far from impressed. I'll get around to reading part 5 someday, but I'm rapidly loosing interest in this seemingly endless series since it obviously has nothing for its characters to do."
1,WHAT YOU PAID IS WHAT YOU WILL GET....AND MORE,"GOOD -1) REASONABLE PRICE2) GOOD STYLING (ESPECIALLY BLACK AND SILVER COMBINATION)3) SUPER SHARP IMAGE (OUTSCORE 400:1 CONTRAST MONITORS)4) AUTOMATIC ADJUSTING (NO NEED TO TOUCH THE MENU / ADJUSTING BUTTON)5) NO DEAD PIXEL (MAY BE I AM LUCKY)BAD -1) NARROW VIEWING ANGLE (ACTUALLY IT'S NOT BAD, IF YOU DON'T WANT OTHER PEOPLE SEE WHAT YOU ARE DOING)2) THE STAND IS TOO HIGH. (HEIGHT IS NOT ADJUSTABLE)3) REPONSE A BIT LATE (WELL IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME, BECAUSE I DON'T READ WHEN SCROLLING)4) THE POWER CORD (FROM MONITOR TO POWER ADAPTER) IS TOO SHORT, I NEED TO TAPE THE ADAPTER UNDER MY DESK RATHER THAN PUT IT ON THE FLOOR)5) CONFUSING MENU BUTTONS (THERE IS A BUTTON FOR FORWARD BUT NO BACK BUTTON, YOU NEED TO KEEP CIRCLING THE MENU...)CONCLUSION: BEST BUY FOR [price]RANGE."
0,Felix,"Coffee is pretty decent, but:1.When using 2 cups filter the coffee is dripping very slowly, can't go through the filter,using tamper makes it worse,2.The distance between the filter holder and cup tray is very short, even small cup hardly fits there, makes coffee machine usage very inconvenient. To make coffee I remove the coffee tray cover and put the cup on the bottom of the tray which is just ridiculous.3.If I knew about this before I wouldn't buy it."
0,Card board stiff,"Stiff and inflexible, abrasive and uncomfortable. Covered by a highlyreflective glass bead? material that makes you easy to see at low light.Causes some flash flair if in the back ground of someone else's picture.Best use would be as a dog leash, and not on an expensive camera."
1,More African/American Issue,"This was basically about how ""WE"" African/Americans view ""THE GAME."" For those who choose to get into the game, realize the whole concept not just getting fast money--""THERE'S NO EASY WAY OUT.""Thank You"
0,Awful...,"Although I passed w/ an 839, this book is, in a word, awful. The errors are unbelievable, the flow is choppy, and the illustrations are difficult to follow - just look at page 469. Quality was definately sacrificed for speed. I can't believe a CCIE put his name on this book. I hope the money was worth the discredit...Although the book did cover everything on the exam, the mistakes lead to lots of re-reading and frustration."
1,this is a very fun cd,i enjoy this cd all the time i think that he is the only good rapper who doent cuss (even thought cussing doesnt offend me)i would srongly recomend this cd to you and anyone else who likes good music the best thing are all of the original beats there something you can just jump around to.overall it is a very good album.
1,Very good Titanic,"Very good toy. My son likes it. He love kits, Aspeccaily Revell. This is one small but he liked it because bulkheads were already put in for him to sink. So he put coins in it, it sank. i was disapointed that it does not include paint, making the model look ugly. But it is nice"
0,Stay Away From Philosophy. Charged Me Then Cancelled My Order.,I was charged $51 for my order. I just got a cancellation notice and no refund. Where is my money at? Very dishonest company. I will NEVER order a Philosophy product ever. You shouldn't charge people then cancel their order. I had better get my money back or I will be taking action.
0,Weak singing doesn't do justice to Dolly's compositions,"Skip this one. I can't understand what all these reviewers are praising this CD about. Stick with Dolly Parton's original versions. There is some incredibly weak (and bad) singing on this CD, with Melinda Etheridge and Skinhead O'Conner leading the worst of the worst. Only Emmylou Harris and Alison Krauss' versions of Dolly's songs are worth listening to. I would love to know what Dolly honestly thinks of these performances. Sigh. I promptly gifted this CD to a lesbian."
1,Great resource,"This book is an excellent resource for anyone wanting to fish in New York State. Detailed information on streams & lakes, fishing access, fish species and much more."
1,Love it,"We've had several other brands, got this for free with a coupon, and like it best. The retraction spring lasts longer than the more expensive brands. Yes, it's annoying that it's free advertising for BabiesRUs, but this shade has stood the test of time, so it gets our vote."
1,After reading lots of reviews on Noni and other razors like these I decided to try an inexpensive one. What a GREAT razor. Great,"Recommed for face, and other small areas. Not sure about legs because of size you could if you wanted to"
0,Not believable,dont waste your time and money. Juvenile. Had to stop half way. Personalities were cardboard cut outs and emotions described were not believable.
0,didn't help me,"I was hoping the chi vitalizer would help my neuropathy and circulation, but it actually made my neuropathy feel worse. It kind of increased the numbness and tingling, plus the feeling like my feet were covered with saran wrap. Really disappointed, because I had great hope for this because I have other foot problems and can't walk for exercise at this time. I know a couple of other people the chi has helped. The machine is well made. I got my money back without any problem, they took out money for shipping tho."
1,The Adobe Photoshop CS Book for Digital Photographers,"This is a great book for anyone who wants to learn about Photoshop. It is well organized, contains a vast variety of techniques and the steps are very easy to follow."
0,Oak Ash & Thorn M.C.S...(L.C.W.),"DISAPPOINTING, WHAT KIND OF HERBAL SHAMANISM INSTRUCTS YOU ""Drink a cup of herb tea OR SODA....""???????????? i had heard this author was known for making.. educated fabrications.. and stating personal experiences as fact, but this book was less than i had prepared for. i read a lot on this subject and i DO NOT RECOMMEND PAYING FOR THIS BOOK! IF YOU WANNA READ IT GO TO A LIBRARY!(i wouldn't make a Special trip, but if you're there....) I put this in the category of BS bedtime stories, the only part i say is good is the personal inventory for why you want to be a shaman, but then its still worded for extreme amateurs and skeptical readers.. this is a Wiccan book for 6th graders, its fantasy fiction, or simply BS.. this wasn't worth the shipping, let alone the $5 i lost.."
0,Sigh!,"I've had this book since year nought. But I have never made anything from it. Having said that I currently have cubed butter and a flour mixture in the freezer. My first stab at making pie from this tome. Obviously my rating of 2 stars does not reflect the quality of the recipes. It's reserved for the wonderful folks at Scribner. I think Ms Beranbaum might be the world's most gifted cake/pie/bread maker but she certainly needs a bit of help when it comes to picking a publisher. My 'Cake Bible' fell apart very quickly as the pages couldn't wait to detach themselves from the feeble spine. This has not happened to my pie bible coz as I said, I've never used it. The sections are not very well organized and having to refer back and forth is annoying. A couple of those built-in bookmarks (like the Gourmet cookbook) would have been so helpful. Anyway, I can go on all day but other reviewers have beaten me to it."
1,As a first time reader,"As a first time reader the book was well written. I love historical romance and the issues it entails. I liked how possessive Brandon was with Heather from the beginning. His loyalty and faithfulness to Heather was refreshing considering he only slept with her one night. Their nemesis Louisa which was Brandon 's ex-fiancee spiteful comments were believable. However, I gave it a 4 star because was way to meek and shy for my taste. She needs backbone to handle a handsome rugged hunk like Brandon. Although, I'll give Heather credit for getting one in the end. Also, I think Kew could of expanded on the sex scenes instead of starting with he kissed her neck with heart beating fast then ending it there. So for you reader's out there if your into romance with a plot and adventure this will be a good read. But if you looking dreamy love scenes forget it look some where else."
1,Wonderful compilation of ancient views of biblical stories,"Lots of short excerpts from ancient texts show how biblical stories were interpreted and expanded by ancients. Interesting as history, literature, and for expanding your faith."
1,"Vivid, intense, adventuresome...eloquently written!","War and upheaval are never a scene where one might expect to find eloquently written images of love, fantasy and true friendship. Vivid, intense descriptions of a young man's feelings rapidly brought on by the war, seem to become that of the reader. Through the eyes of the main character, the reader is quick to learn the lessons of life and death with the war as the instructor. The author's skillful writing allows the reader to actually perceive to have the feelings, emotions and actions experinced by the main character; thus making the book most pleasurable and adventuresome!"
0,Boring and Bad,"This movie revealed to me how difficult it must be to make a good action thriller. Sure, Gina's acting is awful, even painful, but that wasn't the worst part. The movie spends long stretches of time exploring boring, tedious moments set to ridiculous, comically bad smooth jazz. You keep waiting for a reason to care, and it never comes. Watch the four action scenes on Youtube instead."
1,A good place to begin.,"Paradise Lost can be a very difficult poem to read. However, this edition, which contains only the first two books (a good starting point), has a commentary section which was extremely helpful to me as a first time Milton reader. Many of the allusions are clarified to cater t the modern day reader who hasn't yet grown accustomed to Milton's style."
0,This is the worst juicer,"As another reviewer experienced, it broke on the first use. The gear stripped itself out and wouldn't rotate again. I had to send it back. This is the third ""cheapie"" handy juicer I have had in the past six months. I wanted a handy juicer for making a quick morning juice and for when I'm cooking. My food processor has a citrus juicer and an extractor on it, so I didn't want to have another big electrical item to pull out for just a simple glass of juice. These smaller juicers are cheap and poorly made. They are a waste of time and money. I ended up getting a non-electrical handy juicer from Oxo. It is GREAT! Not too hard on the hands for pressing down and does exactly what you need it to do."
0,Junko,I have not found this product to reduce the ringing in my ears. Maybe I have real bells up there.
1,Works as nicely as it looks,"In a time where the choice of cheap 5-port, desktop, GigE switches is plentiful, this one stands out for one simple reason: exterior design. It looks good enough to show off anywhere, and the vertical stand is a great desk-space-saver, something that becomes handier every day.The only case where you wouln't buy this model would be if you need Jumbo Frame support -- but that's something 99% of people with a SOHO setup can't even use (because your standard router for Internet access won-t support it...). So why bother?Definitely my favorite in this price range and feature set. Highly recommended."
0,A Coat Hanger Is Superior,"Save your money folks. This product may work perfectly in the lab, but it's useless in a more 'ordinary' environment. I was actually able to get better recption by creating a 3 foot loop of heavy gauge copper wire (AM). Still haven't figured out what to do to improve FM, but that was the whole thrust behind the Terk."
1,Great Memories,"When I was a child in the late-60s and early 70s, I listened to my father's LP of the Film Festival for hours. Frank Chacksfield made some very excellent records. Percy Faith and Montovani are perhaps best remebered for this genre of music - Beautiful or Easy Listening Music, which changed into something else by the late-70s. Some of the songs here were played on the two beautiful music stations in Chicago, which my father played daily.King of Kings is a good addition to add value to the CD.My favorites are:Theme From 'Elvira Madigan', Theme From 'The Mercenaries', This Is My Song From 'A Countess From Hong Kong', I Will Wait For You From 'The Umbrellas Of Cherbourg', Irina From 'Shalako',A Man And A Woman, and Love Theme From 'Ben Hur'.I am grateful that Dutton Vocalion brought these recordings back. It's been a long time. Great memories."
0,Awful Game. Total waste of time and money.,"Save your money. I play Texas Hold'em regularly and I can tell you that this game is a total waste of time and money. I would rate it Zero if I could.Not intuitive. Slow and awkward to use. Doesn't work with Mac OSX. How any competent reviewer could rate this almost completely unplayable turkey of a game, anything above the lowest rating is beyond belief."
1,Glad I boutht it,This radio-CD player is compace enought to join the other items on my husband's bedside table -- I looked through a lot before I found one that was. His only negative comment is that the instructions weren't very helpful. But he figured it out and is enjoying having his music whenever he is in the bedroom.
1,This is in my top two favorite yoga DVDs,"This DVD is spectacular, and that is not an overstatement. It is filmed beautifully, and the music is perfect. It's also great to use one of the four practices they've created, or make your own. You will never outgrow this DVD.BUY IT!P.S. My other favorite is Power Yoga for Happiness."
1,NOt bad,"THis is a very accessible album by SFU, I think albums like total carnage is garbage, carnage made me laugh to death because of how stupid barnes sounded with that stupid screeching of his. Warpath is an album I actually like by SFU because it has its highlights as well as you can actually understand barnes for once. True its not death Metal but it is good metal none the less. There is nothing wrong with toned down metal as long as its true metal and this album still is true metal."
0,outdated,"Seems to function ( that it tells me it is on ) though that is it. never seems to actually -stop- bothersome calls, soo...perhaps a newer model is needed. Or else the tele market fiends have finally found a way around it."
0,Almost 3 yr old boy only tears the pages up,"My son has never liked this toy from day 1. He tried to touch the pictures, but it is so sensitive that his arm and elbow would touch other pictures. He has ripped up the books. Maybe when he is a little older he will be interested."
0,Think Critically For A Moment,"It's truly a presumptuous individual that claims he knows what is best for all people in all circumstances. And if the cover of this book doesn't promote a stereotypical, racist, and derogatory view, I don't know what does. While the preferences and decisions that one has in regards to their own relationships are a very personal thing and while interracial marriage and relationships are something that deserve serious discussion and consideration, I wonder how anyone feels they can find valid advice or analysis from a volume whose very cover portrays a very racist and derogatory image of a white woman. Anyone should be ashamed to buy or read this jingoistic trash, regardless of their own feelings about whether or not dating or marrying outside of their own race is right for them or not."
0,wrong book delivered,"I ordered for 7th editions but they delivered 5th editions so that doesn't help me at all, i sent the book back to the seller and i never get the money back . that's my terrible experience with the amazon.comregards,Nadege"
0,Wretched album,"Just as some may confuse an amature photograph with an artful one simply because its in black and white, New Found Glory have confused ""mature"" music with sad, crybaby songs. They seem to have Jim Carrey's disease. Too bad."
0,These are Junk!!,Product only charged twice and when they worked only lasted 1 hour on a camera. Don't buy these buy a real Sony battery.
1,A great biography of a sad life,Information on Pier Angeli is hard to find; I'm so glad I found this book! Pier's story is wonderfully told - I simply could not put this book down. I highly recommend it!
0,Title Misleading-Not What You Think,"I bought this book thinking it would help me in my new venture of antique collecting. While the authors are very well-qualified in this subject I feel as though it wasn't written for the average person. This book WILL NOT help you when you go to your Saturday garage sale or flea market. The book spends way too much time on furniture and the second half of the book is all 'practice appraisals' which are for objects the average person will never buy or be able to afford. I felt like this book had a certain 'snob' appeal and if you can afford to buy a $5000 or $10,000 piece you probably have enough knowledge without having to consult a book. (I was stumped because the practice appraisals don't list a value for any of this stuff). Save your money and buy a book that directly relates to what you are collecting or hoping to find."
1,"Matthew, Robinson Crusoe, Moby Dick, and The Tempest","The opening reflection of Geoff Wood's Living Lectionary centers around the Old Testament reading for the First Sunday of Advent, in which Isaiah speaks of beating swords into plowshares. Wood recalls looking a the ruins of the World Trade Center and finding a renewed appreciation for ""all construction in human nature,"" everything from the Golden Gate Bridge to ""the long series of people who, when I flip a switch, flood my home with light and warmth."" Links to Life and Literature is filled with such personal observations as well as connections to literature. For example, Matthew's account of Jesus' baptism is tied to scenes in Robinson Crusoe, Moby Dick, and The Tempest. This refreshing approach to the Year A readings is especially effective in bringing the scriptures to life in twenty-first century America."
0,Do not buy these shoes if you have normal or wide feet!,"These shoes are the narrowest shoes I have ever bought! Half of my foot hangs out from the side of the shoe. These shoes were very expensive and I would have thought they would have been made better. I was wrong! I wear a size 9 , but I bought a size 10 and they still did not fit. Since I received the free shipping discount and I have to return them, I will now have to pay for the original shipping costs and the return shipping costs. Such a waste of time and money! If you do not have a narrow foot I would highly recommend not buying these shoes."
1,Great movie!,"This movie kind of reminded me of Dark City, which I also loved. The idea that someone can create a world and alter it is very interesting to me.The movie was very well written and I was entertained throughout the entire movie. All of the actors did an awesome job. There were a lot of suspenseful and emotionally dramatic moments.The ending left things ambiguous. We are left hanging for no reason. The movie was perfectly wrapped up and it could've just ended. Otherwise, it was awesome and I highly recommend."
1,Flash CS4,The book offers clear step by step instruction that is quite helpful. My 11 year old daughter uses the book to self teach herself Flash CS4 and found it helpful.
1,Highly recommended - a practical gem of a book,"A Christian's life is not always traveled on a smooth paved road. Hannah Smith offers a series of concise, well-written, well-perceived and practical advices on how to navigate through the rought patches. A must reading for Christians who are just beginning their walk or those who have walking but unsure of their current progress."
1,DMX,This C.D. is alright. It isn't his best but I still listen to it. My favorite song on there is probably D-X-L because it has a good beat and it isn't just him rapping on it.
0,Don't waste your money!!!!,What a disappointment!!! Rice crispy treats? Trail mix? Potato peanut candy? Chickpea candy? Boring and gross! I got more candy recipes out of Betty Crocker than this book. Repetitive recipes with slight variations. Claims to have more and 700 recipes....where?
0,Oh NO!,This book was VERY disappointing. First of all the hard cover leads you to believe that the book is of a reasonable size. It's more like a Children book size. Many of the pictures are old and seemingly out of date. I was duped! I also bought his other book at the same time called Derriere and was equally disappointed. WATCH OUT and don't get duped like I did.
1,Great purchase.,"I have been looking for a pressure cooker for quite awhile and after doing alot of comparisons, this is the set that I decided on. Since receiving it I have used it alot and I must say that I'm impressed with the quality and overall ease of cooking with this set. The flavors are just incredible."
0,"Evangelism, or door-to-door sales pitch?","As I write this, I'm looking over the chapter titles for this book. ""Have a Definite Time to Go."" ""Be Soul-Conscious."" ""Be Clean and Neat."" ""Go Two By Two."" ""Be Complimentary."" And so on.So where, pray tell, is the *content* of the message? Well, chapters 21-24 are: ""Show Him that He is a Sinner""; ""Show Him the Price on Sin""; ""Show Him that Jesus Paid the Price."" That, and a few Bible references. Heck, the chapter titles are longer than the chapter contents! Hyles spends more time telling the reader not to smell bad (duh!) than he does explaining what, exactly, the Gospel is.This raises the question: What's being preached here? Christ and him crucified? Or Jack Hyles' Handy-Dandy Handbook for Selling Salvation?"
1,A cute collection,This is a cute collection short tales. Each is about 20-25 minutes long. My daughter could watch it all day.
1,Jesus Dynasty,"Well worth reading if true this would stand Christianity on its head .How would the Vatican react to this ? they would have to re-think and restructure their Dogma. or go out of Business they have covered up the true Family History of Jesus for almost 2000 yrs. Its time for them to make a Good Confession. St Paul Stated People are fools who Believe Jesus Rose from the Dead in Body.He went on to say Jesus arose in spirit. because the body was only a Garment that Decays in Death. & there was no place for a Human Body in the Kingdom of Heaven .I'don't agree with everything in this book, but i will rate it as five stars .R.P.C"
0,The hugest piece of junk I ever bought!,"This phone had absolutely no redeeming qualities! None of the buttons worked properly and when I called the manufacturer the French Canadian customer service girl hung up on me before stating; ""If you bought the phone from some unknown company like Amazon, you deserve to keep it, I never heard of Amazon Too bad for you if it doesn't work."" Nice customer service ""manager"" she told me she was the manager when I tried to call back to complain about her. STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY AND PASS THE WORD. Amazon should discontinue selling their products as well."
0,Rip-off junk,This system made our discs totally unusable. We had to throw them away. What more can I say!
0,Waste of Time!,This book is a waste of time! It is very difficult to understand because of the manner in which it is written. There is a lot of information that is just useless and it is very boring to attempt to get through it!
0,A literary triumph... I can't wait until the movie comes out,"This might be the best book any elitist, intolerant, bigot has ever written. It has it all. It tells you how to live, what to believe, and even what is wrong and right. It is my hope that this book will be in classrooms everywhere someday. Students should just burn all history and biology books and read this book over and over again until it has completely brainwashed them."
0,Windup Galatic Robot,The Galatic Robot Windup by Toysmith was a disappointment. It was damaged and could not windup. Why would a seller send a toy that does not work to a child? The only reason I did not return the toy to the seller is that the shipping costs cost more than this toy. I will not buy another tyoy from Toysmith.
0,Why Did you do it to your self? Why?,"Have you ever heard the saying that when something is good, leave it alone? Well Mr. Omar R. Tyree did the exact oppisite, ""Flyy Girl"" a perfectly good book, and he destroyed it, completly missed it up. Sometimes things don't need a sequel just leave it alone, yet he did it anyway, Tracy growing up is not what people wanted to read about, especially when she lived a life of 30 grown women when she was younger in ""Flyy Girl"" so what more could she have possibly experienced."
0,Complaint,"I ordered this product from Amazon.com and was very excited to get this in, set it up, had problems and called Linksys. I was told that this product does not support AOL, and to go with another model. This will probably be the last Linksys product I buy"
1,Sleeper Combo Set,"For the dollars this is a great buy. Case, flashlight, 2 batteries and fast charger for not too much money. Don't forget it comes with a nice drill too. The controls are easy to reach and it is light weight and well balanced. ..."
1,great cd by the offspring,"this cd has some good punk songs on it. the songs all i want, cool to hate, way down the line, and mota rule. me and my old lady is a weird song. is he talking about his mom in that song? well this cd has the coolest songs."
1,"good packaging, but what about Dave Abbruzzese?","I thought this was a pretty good set, however I think a few things are missing from the unplugged show though. My only real complaint about the set is the fact that on the dvd it only shows Eddie, Stone, Jeff and Mike on the dvd menu, what about Dave Abbruzzese? I kinda thought that was pretty rude, he was an awesome drummer and had a lot of input in the band.I noticed they also blanked him on the photos contained in rearview mirror (the best of) Anyway the remix cd was cool and it was awesome to see unplugged on dvd even if it has been cut."
1,worked at 1st,"I think this product works great but its effectiveness seemed to wear off with our dog after a week or two . . . not sure that's the fault of the gadget, tho. And the price is certainly right."
1,Its worth the money!,I got this to track down cat 5 wires in a office. It is easy to use and very accurate! It will narrow it down to the right wire 9 out of 10 times. The 1 time i could not narrow it down to one it was one of the two that it said it was. This tool now used on all my IT calls and will be for years to come!
0,palm wifi,"Disappointed with this product. The first thing is its excessive need for power, battery life used up in less than 15 minutes!!. Secondly, is the screen resolution with the webpro browser that comes with the palm tungsten T3 is very deficient. A lot of things with graphics will not come up, and the screen even with its unique option to expand the screen, still is very inadequate. Unfortunately I have alredy bought 2, one for myself and my wife's T3. Looking to see if it can be sold back somehow."
0,Amateur Hour Extreme,"This is perhaps the most amateurish movie I've ever seen. It's so ridiculously bad, that I had a hard time believing it was released on DVD. Horrible sound, bad acting, stupid story lines.......no redeeming fun at all. As far as being a kids film....it's too lame for that. Stupidity does not mean kids will like it. Stay away!"
1,The Soundtrack--They Don't Make 'Em Like They Used To,"This is a great movie; the reviewer from the New York Times above obviously watched a different movie than most of America. Anyway, one of the absolute best things about this movie is the soundtrack. You have Harry Connick, Jr. and Jimmy Durante, among several others, singing those timeless songs they just don't sing anymore.I'm a romantic big time, and there's just something about a love story with Nat King Cole singing ""Stardust"" at just the right moment to make a big marshmallow out of me."
0,Don't bother,We got this for Christmas.The battery charger will not work with game boy color. We hardley ever use the light. This is a waste of money unless you have a regular game boy.
0,Christian Propaganda Fails Despite Author's Skill and Talent,"Despite her genuine skill and talent, Anne Perry has hit a solid thud with ""Tathea,"" an obvious name in itself, 'Ta-Thea' indicating a connection with God (theo, thea being the Greek word for God, masculine and feminine). I am very sorry that this was my first Anne Perry book for it has put me off her work forever, I'm afraid. It is pure preachment and succeeds only as a work of Christian propaganda. It turned me off, even with its display of wan tolerance towards other religious viewpoints, as it assumes a superiority of origin. I believe it is revealing and that Perry has written what, for her, represents something deeply personal and genuine, but which, for me, and I'm sure for others, represents something despotically religious. Ultimately, it fails as literature because it has a clear agenda behind the story."
1,A lot of good ideas,"This book had a lot of good natural magic ideas, and I enjoyed flipping through it. Not only is it good to read front to back, but also to dip into to pick out ideas. The chapters are well separated, which is great for finding what you need.The magic in this book is natural, beautiful and back to basics. Nothing over ceremonial, which I like."
1,Even A Lug Like Me Can Bake,"Baking always seemed impossible to me - I'd be lucky to get anything to rise, my food would always weigh a ton and, basically, unless someone really loved me, they probably wouldn't eat more than a couple bites. But with Baking for Dummies, all that has changed. I now whip out cupcakes, breadsand pastry with ease. I can't say enough about the handy tips that the author includes, I've found them extremely useful with other recipies as well. I'm fattening up my office mates with the bounty from my oven and finding that there is great piece of mind in baking."
1,Indispensable!,"I bought this little book back in college, but started using it again recently on a temp job as an Executive Assistant for a CEO. Simply put, it's the best, most concise guide for grammar, style and punctuation that I've come across. Now I use it whenever I write business letters, personal letters and my own creative writing. It makes a wonderful quick guide if you're in a hurry, but also gives plenty of examples to flesh out the do's and don'ts. Many people today don't know how to write well, but the amount of guidebooks out there is downright intimidating. The Little English Handbook is well written, easy to understand, unpretentious, and actually makes you want to learn more about how to use the English language properly. Now you'll know when to use semicolons, how to avoid awkward sentences, and what the heck a conjunctive adverb is! This handbook should be on everyone's bookshelf."
1,Different pace of film,"Read the reviews that rate it 4 or 5 stars, you'll get more detail than I will provide. This was a first-time viewing for me, so I was partially intrigued, but not disappointed. I rated it 4 stars, not that it couldn't be 5, there just lacked a touch of logical progression for me. The Bogie/Bacall combo is there, more subdued than their other notable performances - To Have and Have Not, The Big Sleep, Key Largo. In watching the special features, and learning some behind the scenes info, helped explain some of the ""cheap"" feel some segments had, for me anyway. Least enjoyable character was the grifter, he just lacked a bit for me. All of the others were solid, enjoyable to watch in action. One amusing point was Bogarts observation about how Warner would feel about paying him all that money, for what amount he was seen, too rich!"
1,Saving Jane - Girl Next Door,"Wow what can I say - this is definitely a cd that you need to purchase. Marti, lead vocals, has a unique voice that can remind some of Avril Levine, combined with Sheryl Crow.....and also how about those boys - some awesome eye candy!!!! Happy - love the song - every girl can relate - Sleep on it- well it's on my top list of favorite songs....each song is something that someone can relate too! pick up this cd and be glad you did!"
1,Better Than the Other name brand,I'm a repeat customer because my family likes this product. The price on Amazon is good. I would recommend everyone give it a try!
0,I've tried to like this for 13 years,"Except for ""Everlong,"" most of the music here just doesn't stick in your head. It all sounds the same: ferocious guitars, pounding drums, urgent vocals. And yet, no tunes. ""Everlong,"" though, is a beaut."
1,great game!,This is a fun game to enjoy with the family or friends. You can be involved in easy conversation and play at the same time.
0,Steals the beauty of art,"Like speaking with a doctor, not a fun book, very very interesting information done boring."
0,Not worth it,"This album is way overproduced and the performance lacks emotion for the most part, especially the vocals, which is one of my favorite things about this band. It's just bad. I bought the double CD special edition, and after I listened to the first disc, which is the studio album, I almost went and returned it. Then I listened to the bonus disc, which is demos of all the songs. It was SOOOO much better. The writing is better, the production is better, and the performance has so much mor energy. I showed the difference to 3 other people and they all agreed that the demos were better. I don't know what the band members were thinking, but they should have released something more like thte demos. The studio album sounds like generic bad pop rock, whereas the demos sound like good music. So, if you are thinking about getting this album, just go for the double cd bonus one."
0,What a disapointment,"I consider myself a big star wars fan, and I wish I didn't waste my money on this DVD. The hype on this is very over rated. All the news on the deleted sense being so great. They were ok but the better ones of course were on the second disk and not part of the movie at all. Who was the idiot that decided that one? I don't know about anyone else but I buy DVD's to see the deleted sense during the movie not separate! Save your money. It's not worth it unless you are a die-hard fan but even then be prepared to be disappointed."
1,Great tool!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is a great addition to the tool I already have. It will make trimming sooooo much easier. Great quality product.
1,Good Product,"The product itself is indeed very refreshing - it's like washing your face with orange juice!The only reason I didn't give it five stars (as I did in my first review) is because, after giving it such high marks, the pump began leaking. Every time I pumped, the soap poured through the pump plunger, all over the container and then all over the bathroom counter. Very disappointing. I'm ordering again with the hope that it was just a fluke."
0,"Who likes these idiots, not us toads!","Toro: Say Pancho(laughing), Green Day named an album after themselves, the stupido Maricone Idiots! Pancho: Si Toro, anyone who gives these fake punks a 5 star are ridiculous. Toro: Pancho, the lead singer's name is Billie Joe, I think he is either a hermaphrodite or a redneck(laughs). Pancho: Toro, he is loco in the cabasah. Toro: Songs like the title track, Boulevard of Broken Dreams and Wake Me Up When September Ends prove these guys only care about money and not their fans. Pancho: These loco gringos had to jump on Bush-bashing kick to resuscitate their sagging career. Toro: Anyone who is loving these gringos are stupido, BAMINOS from this PRONTO!"
0,"Good advice, I guess....","Suze Ormon's advice is important to pay attention to,but in my opinion it's possible to get elswhere in abetter package. If you like Suze's presentation, fine,but she just seems overly chirpy to me. She's FAR betterIMHO than Mr. Kiyosaki of the two Dads, or real estatepromoter Robert Allen, for instance, butmy taste runs more to the Dolans, Jane Bryant Quinn, orAndrew Tobias....or Benjamin Graham, though he's far lessentertaining.Don't spend all you make!Pay yourself first!Hey, maybe I should write a book.

1,Vtech-Tote'N Go Laptop Plus,"Vtech-Tote 'N Go Laptop Plus is great for my 4 and 7 year olds. It teaches Alphabet, Numbers, and other fun games. I'll be using it for years. It's nice to have a lap top toy for children to learn on."
0,Not Worth The Money or The Time,"A dime store ""novel"", at best, which, after reading a few pages, I realized was not anything close to a real book. Should not have been represented as a new Tom Clancy novel and certainly should not have had the promotional references to character development on the back cover. Repetetive passages about perfect submarine kills with no true represetation of realities of life at sea, maintenance or weapons problems. I fault the bookstore for displaying it as a Tom Clancy novel, and I fault Tom Clancy for not clearly labelling this as NOT a novel."
0,Don't Buy Refurbished,"I bought the refurb version of this player, and am sorry that I did. The tray on the first one wouldn't close all the way. The second one (yea, silly me...)wouldn't play, and the turntable wouldn't turn. Both times, this was right out of the box. I'm out $30 for having to ship these back. I guess that I'll have to repair my 15 year old Sony."
1,When The Best Isn't Enough,"Before starting a major macro project, I purchased this book and ""VB & VBA In a NutShell"". What VBA language knowledge I possessed beforehand I had gathered from hither and yon and by experimenting with Word. This book was fundamental to understanding the object model and to understanding many specific areas (bookmarks, find and replace, section breaks, to name a few). However, it is dated and occasionally threadbare. You will still need to gather information from online forums and such to round out your knowledge. I read many reviews here before purchasing and I have no doubt that it is the best book of its kind, but it's still not enough. You will need this book for medium-to-large macro projects, but don't rely upon it exclusively."
0,too small,I thought this would be good for my dog but when I got it. It was so tiny. Would be great for a kitten or a small puppy
1,Great investment,"This is a great way to invest in woodworking, you get to plane your own boards for an added level of personalization. It would be nice if this unit had two speeds but for the price, it is fantastic. Very little snipe and easy adjustments make planing more enjoyable than some other units. The dust hood needs to be screwed into the cutterhead which is a little obnoxious but once it is attached you don't need to think about it again...until you go to fold the outfeed table back up. Planed over 1000 linear feet of lumber with no problems other than some sawdust sticking to the rollers making them slip. Overall, I'm very happy with the DW764."
0,reviewing hot target,This book has to be one of the worst books that I have ever attempted to read. I'm a prolific reader and I found it impossible to maintain any interest . There was no plot that I could see...the writing was sophmoric at best and I had to throw the book in the trash after struggling through about thirty pages. How and why a publisher put this book on the market is a mystery to me.
1,Great book...,"I love Grisham's books. I don't think he's written a disappointing one, yet, unlike most authors. Great story with an even better ending. Bravo..."
0,Worst. Movie. Ever.,"Words cannot capture the awfulness of this movie. The bad acting, flat direction and gimmicky camera shots are overshadowed only by the dreadful script. Until looking it up on IMDB, I was convinced that ""I Me Wed"" was written by a fourteen year old girl. The word trite does not begin to describe it.Yet I agree with the other review. You MUST have this movie in your DVD collection. Put it beside ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" and ""Ishtar"". So bad it's good...so bad it's awesome. If only Mystery Science Theatre 3000 was still around and did romantic comedies."
0,Not Good for Video Files,"Bought this USB version after happily using a Firewire Lacie external HD for many years. This USB version does not work well with Mac OSX. Some files (in my case, video) will not copy over. The error msg is a ""-50"" error about a problem with the file name. Worse, files that appear to copy successfully are corrupted and won't play."

1,CD's Music is a stairway to heaven,"For years to come, I know I will remember the last dances at my Junior High school, when they play Stairway to heaven as the last dance. Everyone, even those considered ""outcasts"" (I always feel bad) wants to dance to the wonderful song. It is the nicest thing that I have ever done, dancing slowly to the perfect, heavenly song with someone I like. Sometimes, I feel like I'm floating away by the guitar solo at the end."
0,Just finding equations,"What would really improve this text is if lessons towards the end of the text, chapters 6 and on, included the equations from previous chapters so the reader could get a general understanding of the material needed to the problems in the text.Also, it would be nice if the text included sample problems like the first 20-25 problems at the end of the chapters. Finally, I would like to see calculation of intrinsic amounts of carriers. Every time I do it I get something far from what the text uses in its problems."
0,Ugh!!!,"Holy crap! What a stinker! I've seen better films made by junior high students with the old wind up film cameras. I am a huge Barker fan and even loved the ultra cheesy 80s films such as Rawhead Rex and the like, but this one?!?!? Eep! The filming all in negative hurt my eyes, as did the wang-shot. No thanx, man.I don't care if you are a goth, horror buff, OR artsy-fartsy film maker hopeful. It sucked no matter how you slice it. This film (or was it two? Aw who cares) should have been left in the vault.The only good part was the half naked ""Redemtion Films"" vampire chicks, who sort of did the horror host trip at the beginning.I don't know, maybe if you ""dropped"" first you might get what's going on, but even having read the books, it was too ambiguous for me."
1,Water for elephants was amazing!,"The book its self was amazing let alone the characters. The characters, such as Jacob and Marlana, became a part of me, Walter and Camel too. I love this book and probably always will."

1,Good pans for the price.....,"I got these on sale on they're pretty good pans for the price I paid. They're obviously not the top of the line Calphalon pans, but for omelets and little things they work great. Very easy to wash as well."
0,Horrible,Item was described to be a safe plastic cat toy what arrived was wire dipped in paint. It had a very unpleasant smell and the wire was very brittle. I decided to throw the wires away rather then risk seriouse harm to my cats.
1,"Cool Music, great value","I bought this disc after attending many of the International pop Overthrow shows in L.A., 2004. A lot of good bands and a lot of crappy ones. But 75% of what made it onto this compilation is good stuff.Nearly all of this music is in the classic guitar driven, vocal harmony, hook laden Beatles-Cheap Trick school of rock and that ain't bad. No, that's quite good, as a matter of fact.For me the standout track is by the Shamus Twins. There's three of them, so how can they calll themselves the Shamus Twins? Anyway, their track is called ""I Hide"", and it has a very modern rock feel to it, though still Beatle-esque.I highly recommend this CD to any rock or pop lover who appreciates song craftsmanship and hooks hooks hooks!"
0,Disappointed in what could have been a neat toy......,"This toy stopped working in 2 days! Tried new batteries, didn't work. I've written Hasbro asking about returning it. Toy store wouldn't take it back, as I already threw out the box. Just seems to me that a toy intended for children to ""whack"" would be a bit more sturdy! My son was crushed when his birthday gift stopped working :("
0,This won't be HD Demo,"What a difference between a documentary and a post card ? A little bit of soul.Very far away from ""Planet Earth""As HD DVD, I'm surprised of the low quality of the shooting or the transfert : it look like a poor standard DVD.Over saturated colors, over exposed (whites) instable images, jolts, judder, dirt on the camera lens. I have the impression of beeing fooled..."
0,Private Practice,Maybe it was the mood I was in but I found this program to be inane. It was recommended as a funny medical show. I felt more like it was a frat movie set in a hospital.
0,dissapointed,"I was quite anxious to get the book and start cooking, but when I received the book I was very dissapointed with the book itself. It is not inviting in any sense. I just can not believe that there are only handful of pictures of the respices in the book. I guess it is just more important to get, I don't know, several books out in one year rather than doing one professionally. Cooking is something of a special field of ""science"" and a well made cookbook with appropriate pictures will not only give one that preliminary ""taste"" of the recipe but the visual connections makes your mouth water. Afterall, a picture can describe thousand words.The recipes provided are nothing spectacular either. I was expecting much more. Too many burgers for one thing."
0,Could have been a TV episode!,"Being a huge X-Files fan I am very disappointed. The first movie was great and I'm sure the X-Filers were eager for the long awaited 2nd feature film but Chris Carter and the production team blew it on this one. Everything about this movie could have been done in a regular TV episode. Not big screen material. What happened to the aliens and unexplained phenomenon? I had to keep from falling asleep during most of the movie. I cant even say it was worth the rental but it was nice to see Fox and Dana together again. I would have given it one star but just to see these two in the same feature together and the fact that I always liked the X-Files, I'll give it a weak two stars."
1,innocent kids' book,"I remember doing a book report on Alice and the Boa Constrictor in the fourth grade. It was a cute book suitable for both males and females, about a fickle little girl who decides one day that she wants a snake and gets one. I hated snakes as a kid and still do, but this is a very charming book."
0,The Wizard of OZ??,"This is a very well-done recording but it doesn't come close to matching the magic of Judy Garland, Ray Bloger, Bert Lahr, or Jack Haley. For me this isn't the ""real"" Wizard of Oz. Please buy the cd with the classic voices instead of this remake!"
0,Don't get your hopes up,"I was excited to find a crockpot cookbook that didn't have lots of recipes with cream of mushroom soup in them. Some recipes are written more clearly than others. Some have a range for how long you should cook stuff instead of a particular number.I tried 3 recipes. First was a Rosemary Chicken recipe which cooked the chicken too long and dried it out. Then I tried a macaroni and cheese recipe which burnt. Finally I tried a recipe for chicken with soy sauce and honey which once again was dried out. The seasonings were good and some of the recipes were pretty unique, hence the 2 star rating.I followed the directions to the letter and even had the same size crockpot which they mentioned in the recipe!So if you choose to use this book, watch the food VERY CLOSELY."
0,Worse Movie Ever!,If you are thinking about watching/buying this movie DON'T! I actually bought it because a friend said it was funny. It is truly one of the worse movies I have EVER seen.
1,Rowenta DG5030 Pressure Iron and Steamer,"When I say the lady on the T.V. advertising this item, I thought she must be joking because she said something like the following: ""I hated ironing and now I love it"". Well, I came to find out that this is true. I bought this item because I only needed to use the steamer portion of it more than the ironing, because I hate ironing. NOW, I FIND THAT I CANNOT WAIT TO IRON OR STEAM MY FAMILY'S COTHING! BUY IT! It will change the way you look at doing laundry. By-the-way, it also cuts my time in More than half.Happy Ironing!A.

1,"Excellent functionality, but can't download",I love this thing. I've been using it for several months have no complaints about the unit.I am having a problem transferring data to/from my toshiba laptop (garmin released a firmware update in Jan04).Garmin tech help shrugged their shoulders and said it is a toshiba problem. Anyone else having problems synching the unit with a toshiba laptop?
0,Stick with the first 'Speed'!,"This is not a good movie. It has bad editing, horrible script, bad action-sequences, dumb-villian, hammy acting, except for Sandra Bullock who's playing herself in a surprisingly annoying way. Nothing seems to be right here. The only thing worth-wile is the final resort-crushing sequence. Rent it first. If you like Sandra Bullock I recommend 'Speed', if you like Jason Patric I recommend 'After Dark My Swet, and if you like Willem Dafoe I recommend 'Platoon' or 'The English Patient'. From a scale of 1-10 I give it a 3."
1,The Staple Singers,"This is one of the most inspiring, uplifting, moving, and wonderful recordings of all time. Mavis, ""Pops"", Cleo and Yvonne. I salute all of you.........THANK YOU!!!"
1,what happens next?,"I finished this in 2 days, reading every chance I had. Since this was based on the author's own family, I knew that there must be more information. Even though he gave some information about what happened to his ancestors, I would like to have more information based on his genealogy. Knowing about this family, I care about what happened to them. How did this affect the other children? Mr. Pope alludes to the effect on the family through the generations--having to be better than good. I finished the book weeks ago & still find myself thinking about the family & wondering, what happened next?"
0,If you loved the first movie do yourself a favor and don't watch this !!!,I consider Boondock Saints (the first movie) one of my top five flicks. Like many others I could not way to see All saints day.... I wish I would have.This was the biggest piece of rat turd I have ever seen. EVERYTHING was wrong with this film here's a breif list to startThe acting was terribleSean Patrick Flannery has you guessing if its really him do to some TERRIBLE plastic surgery (no joke I checked the back of the DVD 3 times to make sure and am still sketchy about it)The script - embarrassingThe music - HorriblePlot- there was one?This movie sucked 5 minutes in and continued straight to the end .Seriously I can't believe this movie is allowed to exist. I also can't believe that it was the same director and actors as the first.I cannot express how awful this film was . PLEASE if you loved the first movie DO NOT WATCH this it will ruin it for you.
0,Such a disappointment from such great actors!,"OK as a freebie Sunday night made for TV movie. Not worth renting, let alone buying this one. Just goes to show that the names alone do not a movie make.Not much of a story -- ho hum characters -- predictable ending. What a combination for a bomb. A truly forgettable movie. Nothing stands out except that it was somewhat like Sleepless in Seattle.It's supposed to be a romantic comedy. So where's the romance and the comedy? It was more of a story about good friends who cybercommunicate on an intimate level, but have not formally met.Interesting story but not interesting enough to make a full length movie about. A half-hour episode would suffice. Maybe Tom and Meg should consider a weekly TV sitcom and leave the movies to someone else."
1,A Classic,This is a classic movie; I remember seeing it when it was first released. I wanted my daughter to see it after reading Anne Frank's diary.
0,Misled and Disappointed,"I purchased this kit because I wanted to put a label on a DVD I made. There was nothing in the accompanying online blurb which indicated that it would work only with Windows. So I, a confirmed Mac man, found that the mounting disk would open, but I could not make it work properly. The stock on which the disc blanks and spines were imprinted seemed very heavy, but the adhesive-backed portion worked OK using the round plastic mounting device in the kit. PhotoShop made me a form that matched the printed position of the labels and I filled it in with my own design. None of the designs provided on the disk of the kit met my needs, and in any event I am not sure that I could have transferred them to PhotoShop."
1,Definitely the best from Oasis,"What else is there to say? Before all the commercial success, unnecessary hype and unhealthy agitation around the band, this little gem rocked my stereo. Much less Beatles-influenced than their second album this one is also much more electric, filled with Noel's pentatonic solos, repetitive but fun, and cool seventies-sounding riffs. Anyhow, in my opinion, Oasis hasn't been able to surpass this LP yet and probably won't ever be able to. Start your collection here."
1,Excellent in the pool,"I bought this floating lounge chair for myself, but my husband has taken it over. He loves to be able to float around (sitting upright) in our pool and drink his beer while the world passes him by! It is well-made and very comfortable. It's great deal through Amazon.com with their free shipping. I just may get another one!"
0,Frustrating,"This book, though containing some useful strategies, is riddled with errors, and contradictions. After taking a test and reviewing answers, some explanations basically say ""these four answers are wrong for these reasons and it's obvious that the last is correct."" Having a tremendous amount of formal logic in my background, I can tell you in many cases they are WRONG. I have the seond edition and you'll notice, for example, in the explanation for quesiton 10 on page 99 there is a blatant contradiction between the explanation for answer B and for answer D. B states Cartier-Bension is NOT confrontational (and is the basis for their answer), where D states his relationship WAS confrontational! Huh? Did they proofread??!!The furstration endured with this book is severe and the questions seem harder (and more vauge) than on any other REAL LSAT I've seen. If anything, practicing on harder questions will make LSAT day a snap.The strategies are this book's only saving grace."
1,"good size, very reflective.",I bought these stickers for my new trailer. They are highly visible and do not require any installation. No permanent damage to the integrity of the trailer walls.
1,Fabulous Euro Sounding Synth,"The synth power machine called Cosmicity (AKA Mark Nicholas)creates some of the best underground synth music available. Smooth and polished, catchy lyrics, and great mixing are all put into every album. You can't ask for much more than this.This album contains two of his classics Too Far Gone and Orange. Both songs that will beg to be replayed. This is one of his more emotional moments in his vast discology. Perfect for driving or just listening while alone but not one of his ""upbeat dance"" albums. If you like the Pet Shop Boys album 'Nightlife' this will rightfully take a respected place in your collection!"
0,FIX TO WHY COLLAR DOESNT WORK AFTER COUPLE MONTHS,"I FIGURED OUT HOW TO FIX THE COLLAR WHEN THE COLLAR DOES NOT RESPOND EVEN AFTER PUTTING IN NEW BATTERIES.OPEN THE CASE AND REMOVE THE BATTERY HOUSING. THEN TAKE A BUTTER KNIFE AND DIRECTLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THECIRCUIT BOARD IS A LITTLE METAL ARM, GENTLY PRY THE ARM UPWARD SO IT MAKES BETTER CONTACT WITH THE BATTERIESIN THE HOUSING. THIS IS MY SECOND COLLAR AND WAS PRETTY FRUSTRATED THAT IT NEVER WORKED AFTER A FEW MONTHS.NOW IT DOES! THIS IS A GREAT DEVICE FOR MY CAT WHO LIKES TO URINATE IN CERTAIN AREAS OF THE HOUSE. WORKS GREAT!!!! NOW THAT I FIXED IT I WILL GIVE THIS ITEM 5 STARS!!!!!"
1,Loved it!!!,"I love this set! All of the movies are together in one box, which is very handy. The quality is excellent: the color, sound, and picture are all great. The package arrived even before the estimated time of delivery. It was shipped immediately after I placed my order. Again, love this set!!!"
1,"5,000 stars wouldn't be enough","I bought this CD one week after it came out in '96. It didn't come out of my stereo for almost a month. I have loved TON from before the Carnivore days. I would follow them down any road. Oct. Rust is simple genious music, it truely looks into the pits of human thought and desire. I will own World Coming Down on Sept 21. I would never wait when buying a band like Type O Negative. Oct Rust will not dissapoint anyone!!!!!"
1,a good challenge,"I was introduced to this book through an anatomy class for a high school course. This book is definetly not for the casual anatomy student. The book has so much detail it is overwhelming but it is very helpful in forcing you to apply and learn the material. It definetly gets you allong the course, plus who doesnt like to color."
1,Better than Average,"Lets not carried away. This is not a great movie. Its 1961 predecessor was. This is a film for those who are curious to know what happened to Mr. 'fast' Eddy Felson. The script is good, whatever our 3* friend may think, and the performances are certainly assured. But this movie isn't as enduring as The Hustler, and you will grow more tired of it than you would think possible on first view. The portrait of hustling is laughably unrealistic, and the ending dire, but there is sufficient empathy with characters, in spite of a slightly unneccesary love triangle, to ensure emotional involvement. If you like pool watch this. If you like cinema watch The Hustler."
0,An interesting but dangerous book...,"I feel sorry for the poker novice that buys this book and sits in a low limit game using the ""theories"" presented here. The style of play illustrated is much too aggressive for the average player especially at a low-limit table where many players will stay to see the flop regardless of what they're holding. It does, however, contain some interesting stories about Phil's own exploits. If you want to learn more about Phil Hellmuth, this is a good book. If you want to learn to play poker, there are many better reads."
0,Terrible Movie,"I was tempted to dump this movie several times. The dialogue, particularly in the trial is not realistic. The jury verdict in no way reflects the evidence. Everything about this silly movie was predictble and boring.Just not worth watching. I'm not certain why I gave it two stars."
1,Outstanding overview of recent Korean history,Anyone who wants to brush up on the issues surrounding North and South Korea would do well to pick up this volume. It is well written and actually enjoyable to read. You will also pick up a lot of historical tidbits from the era from the author who was actually there as a reporter. Especially interesting were his observations of North Korea made during a trip there.
1,Nothing Compares To You.,"Sinead's first two cds are her best. I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got (IDNWWIHG) is a classic with the hits ""Nothing Compares 2 U"" and ""The Emperor's New Clothes"" with non-hit classics like ""Three Babies"" and ""Black Boys on Mopeds"" Sinead proved that she was a force to be reckoned with. This cd is a must have for any rock collector. One of the greatest singers of all time."
0,cheap glasess,"seem they are made from plastic and the quality is really bad, the image is deflected and there's a strange reflex on computer screens."
0,Save your money,"Normally I am a person who loves and cherishes books, but this one will not even get shelf space in my house. And, quite frankly, I would be embarrassed to even give it away! I could not find ONE redeeming feature in this book. It has an absurb premise, is poorly written and would be the only book I know that I would nominate for tinder at a book burning. Save your money. Run don't walk away from this one."
0,Product key was no longer valid due to old sofware!!,"I bought this product on amazon but it turns out the product keys was not valid I call Anonymizer to get another one, they told me "" I don't know why people still selling old software, it's no longer valid"" and they will not help you unless you are purchasing their new software directly from them... you'll need to contact the person who sell it to you if it was not from amazon warehouse you'll lose your money, individual sellers do not refund your money. BE AWARE OR LOSE!"
1,Great for Starters,"I have had this camera since October 2003 and I'm very satisfied with it. It's my first digital camera and got it for a great price (considering its features). It is compact and it doesn't consume a lot of power. The image quality is good. I'm no professional photographer, so I mostly e-mail my pics or take the card to somplace and have the pics printed.There's no escape: you have to read the manual & get to know the camera . The controls are handy and you can say that it is a point-and-shoot product.Outdoor pictures with plenty of light are excellent. Can't say the same about night shots. They tend to come out dark and blurry (at least with the auto mode on).Bottomline: This camera is a great choice for non-professionals and starters."
0,Not Like Garret PI series,I am a huge fan of Glen Cook's Garrett PI stories. I really disliked Tower of Fear because it tried to tell about the adventure from several protagonist viewpoints. It's almost like he's trying to write an episode of the world he portrays as opposed to one person's adventure. It does add a lot of pages to the book if he is being paid by page.
1,Great all purpose case,"Affords very good protection and is great looking too. Belt clip is secure but doesn't add a lot of thickness and the flip secures via a magnetic clip. The charge port is inaccessible while in the case, but I don't find it to be a particular hardship to slip it out of the case. I prefer having as much coverage by the case as possible.Definately buy this case, but get it at Office Depot where its only $19.99."
0,Strange Effects,"When I placed this device on my TV I think it worked too well, suddenly I was unable to receive any digital TV stations, only analogue broadcast through the air. As soon as I removed the sticker my TV worked properly again. I had a similar effect with my cell phone, I was unable to receive calls until I removed the sticker.These things work TOO well"
1,Good!,Decent movie; good action; no scrapes on the disk; NOT Biblically correct... it will make you think though; great ending.
0,CD not received,"I'm sure I would have liked this CD, but after quite a bit of time had passed, the bookseller notified me that the CD was not in good shape and he/she wasn't sending it. Although I appreciate the truthfulness about the condition of the CD, the communication was too slow"
0,Terrible!,"I have lived in France - in Paris. I have been fortunate enough to have traveled throughout Normandy and Brittany and most recently, Provence. I can attest to the fact that this book is not reflective of authentic Provencal decoration.Provence decor is much more earthy, much more eclectic. It encomapasses the new couch with the comfortable chairs that have seen several generations. The people of Provence treasure their time-worn furniture and artifacts. The photos in this book show contrived, over-decorated settings which are completely out of step with the lifestyle of Provence where families, including children and pets really LIVE in their homes. Even affluent families with homes decorated by professionals, do not have rooms like these."
1,Intriguing Brahms intermezzos.,"I'm mostly familiar with the Intermezzos played here. Gould released them seperately on vinyl for Columbia in the 1960'a. That recording, as included on this two CD set, is very special.Particularly, Opus 118 #2. Gould kind of draws out the inner voices of these intimate Brahms piano pieces like no other pianist I have heard. He makes you relealize that each note is important and that it could not possibly be left out. I surely would recommend this CD set, if for no other reason than that."
0,Total and utter nonsense.,"I can't believe that Tom DeLonge and Travis Barker even had the gall to put this junk out. It's just the next Blink 182 album, minus the singer who's voice is actually tolerable (Mark) and plus more awful, awful lyrics from Tom. Not to mention that the music isn't much of a departure from Blink's usual poppy, 3-chord fare. It's only amusing to think that Box Car Racer are referred to as Tom and Travis' ""emo"" band and they compared themselves to Fugazi and Quicksand. If you want to buy something that is good, maybe actually get a Fugazi album or something. Dare to explore. These 30-something teenagers sure didn't."
1,Great Secret ingredient,"Smoky Chipotle is great to add to any Southwestern dish. Not too hot, this is roasted Jalapeno pepper. This is a terrific, hard to find product."
1,Serbian Film Review,"This is the most sickest, depraved, and craziest movie I've ever seen!My wife refuses to watch it again but I LOVED IT!!!! There is a reason this movie can't be bought in stores and once you watch it you'll know why."
0,I'm not impressed....,"This carseat is a heat box....my poor baby is drenched EVERY time we get him out of it, even after very short trips with the A/C maxed!Also, it is very heavy and not user friendly. I would not recommend this to anyone..."
1,"Good fun, but not quite as good as Casino Royale.",As an avid James Bond fan I feel that Daniel Craig's Bond is a terrific and more accurate portrayal of Ian Fleming's character. This movie is good fun and action packed - though not quite as good as Casino Royale.
1,great stress reliever in office,I have one of these and enjoy it tremendously for stress relief in my office. Lightweight and easy to set up and pack again...in a couple of minutes.
1,Motley Crue Rules!!!!,I was at this concert when they were making this DVD it was an awesome experience. When I watched this DVD it was like I was there all over again. This is a great DVD and there is no better band in the world and there will never be a better band then the CRUE!!!! Buy this DVD you will not be disappointed.
1,"Effective, doesn't make water taste too bad","I've used these several times over the past year, and compared to other chemical water treatments they're relatively painless. You don't have to force yourself to down chemical-tasting water.To the earlier reviewer who mentioned treatment time: 4 hours is a worst-case scenario mandated by the EPA for killing one type of organism (cryptosporidium) in water that is both very cold and very dirty. All bacteria and viruses, except cryptosporidium and giardia, are killed in 15 minutes (even in cold water). Cryptosporidium and giardia are both killed in 30. In cold, very dirty (cloudy) water, it can take 4 hours for a full crypto kill."
0,Falls off,"I purchased this cap to replace the one we lost from our 18-55 mm Canon lens. This is the kit lens that comes with the Rebel T1i and it is labeled 58 mm. Like other reviewers have noted, the cap falls off with the slightest tap. It seems that the 2 side tabs that apply the pressure to the lens rim do not quite expand far enough out to fully grip. This was surprising since I thought buying a Canon branded cap would assure me a tight fit.I ended up removing and modifying the inner tension ring of the cap so the tabs would expand further out. Just use a small metal file to remove some of the plastic that hold it in place and reinstall."
0,I USED to be blonde...,"Wow, I feel like such an idiot...I had already shampooed and applied the product when I decided to look up reviews. I am a blonde and started to freak out when I saw that others were reporting brassy and orange discoloration after using the product. I decided that my hair still looked bright & blonde, so it was probably some fluke on their part. I was even happier when, after blow-drying my hair, it STILL looked shiny, straight and still immaculately blonde. Fantastic! Until I started in with the straightening iron. I was almost in tears as I saw my hair change from gorgeous to brassy & tacky. This product may work, but it's certianly not for anyone with light hair. I am extremely disappointed that it states it's ""safe for all types of hair, even color-treated & highlighted"", when it's obviously not. Now I have to deal with hoping that I can return the crap to get my $16 bucks back so that I can turn around and pay someone to fix my hair color. Terrible product."
1,Gospel Truth,"One of the happy outcomes of The Da Vinci Code phenomenon is a wider awareness of the ""Gnostic Gospels"". Publishers have not been slow to respond, but this precious volume towers above the crowded scene along with its companion titles in the series: the Gospels of Thomas and Philip. The French admire and understand these long-lost Scriptures and Leloup uniquely combines mystical insight with scholarly wisdom. The big problem is that other most editors and commentators ""leave the track"" because they are one or the other. Your best guide is qualified in both fields! Take this book to your heart."
1,"Fascinating, hilarious, and witty!","""Courtesans and Fishcakes"" is without a doubt thecleverest and most entertaining bit of writing on classical Athens Ihave ever come across. Davidson combs the classical authors (many of whom had seemed drained of life by other scholars) and finds remarkable and startling things about the ancients' love of wine, sex, and, not least, fish. Recommended! END"
0,"Bizarre, Weird, Waste of Time and Money, Disappointing",The first was great. This second one is simply bizarre and lacking in every aspect. Probably one of the worst children;s movies ever.
0,Had to return it for a refund,Brand new battery still in the package that would not run the camera nor would it accept a charge from the charger. its a good thing I still have an old battery that still works.
0,Poorly Constructed,"This battery charger is much better than a standard manual charger in so much as it properly charges a battery through stages. It will not charge a battery that is ""dead"" without faulting. Best to give your battery a boost from a manual charger, then switch over to the Smart charger. The battery clamps are very poorly made and will easily break. Replacement parts are not available through the manufacturer."
0,This is two hours of my life I can't get back.,"Although there were a few humorous parts in this movie, there was no plot. I kept trying to find it, but it wasn't there. The movie was so far fetched that I would like to slap the writers. It's a waste of time and money. They leave a lot of lose ends untied and just when you think the movies going somewhere, it doesn't. I'm ashamed of you Richard Gere."
0,Myron Boitar.,".Deal Breaker. - Broken, could not read it and returned it. I liked his other books, maybe I have outgrown this type of thing. Bored, bored, bored."
0,God Awful,"this musical is the pits. I saw it on Broadway and loved it because the sets were as integral as the production. But the major mistake the film makers made was to film this on location, using the actual streets of Manhattan (where I live)It was a gimmick that you couldn't forget in watching this hideous exercise in movie making. In watching the cast prancing up empty New York streets, and wondering how did they do that, you get easily bored because there's so little color. The cast is wretched. No wonder you've never heard of any of them since except for Victor Garber. ""Day by Day"" sounds like a bunch of bleating sheep, because the singers are so desperate to make the story come alive. I'm usually a sucker for any musical but this is one that will never find its way onto my shelf."
1,Too perfect!,"This book had me laughing from beginning to end because majority of the things she talks about are so dead on! Coming from a ""shiksa's"" point of view, Grish nailed it. I was actually talking about this book with one of my clients who was jewish, and he called me last night to tell me that he picked it up for his wife...and his daughter! Even if you aren't dating a jewish man yourself, the book is full of witty lines and makes for a great beach read."
0,This would be fun and educational but Galt messed up,"My children used an older version of this type of marble game and went bonkers over it. The toy we used was a friends. My wife bought Galt's version and I am ready to toss it into the garbage can. I just hope the retailer will accept a return. The problem is that Galt's materials engineers cut back on the connector strength and the pieces do not stick together well. All it takes to knock this toy down is a minor bump. My kids were totally frustrated and so was I. This was not an issue with the toy my friend had.Galt, you saved a few pennies on plastic on each set you built but you created a useless toy. Two thumbs down!!!!!!"
0,"Um, Interesting, I Guess","Well, this book is different, I guess. My 6th grade teacher made me read it, along with many other books. I don't think that that the character deserves to be glorified. He had no respect for his family, his life, and the wilderness. He actually believed that he and a bag of rice could brave the Alaskan wilderness. As always, the wilderness overcame. He got what he deserved. The best part was the little paragraph on the back cover about the author, because I couldn't wait to get there. The book was very slow. There was a lot of gobbely-gook, and the writing was nothing special. I would recomend this to someone who has read every other book on earth."
1,A VERY COOL CD,CHE IS AN AWESOME DIVA .I LOVE SONGS WITH THIS KIND OF RHYTHM AND SOUND.WAY TO GO CHER
0,Reversed polarity,The cord I received had the polarity reversed; the neutral wire was hot and vice versa. I sent it back and promptly received another one just like it! This can be dangerous if connected to an appliance that requires polarity. The wide blade and the square end should both be neutral.
1,I like the part with the hose,the hose is a pretty good part. the ghosts are in there and thats how you know you beat them.
0,Pathetic,I own a small motel and bought this software to use to give our Spanish speaking employees instructions. When I could get the software to work the employees could not understand the Spanish translations. It also was not compatable with the reservation software that I use and blew it off my computer. I had to reload the reservation software after loading the language translator. Then when I shut the computer down at night it blew my reservation software off again. The technical support was absolutely useless. The only thing they would offer was a program for over $200 that they said would work better. When I tried to get my money back I was told to forget it. Don't buy this unless you have money to throw into the trash.
0,Terrible,"I found this book trite in plot, especially in conclusion. The story felt very unresolved due to the poor climax, and it wasn't the 'spirituality' of it that turned me off. The entire work was rife with cliché.Save yourself the time, you'll never get back the hours of your life wasted reading this."
0,Disappointed,"Our family loves Rachel Ray on television and my kids were excited when they got her cookbook as a gift. The cartoon-style pictures and unusual names for the dishes are cute, but bad editing and outright mistakes in the recipes make this a frustrating ""first"" cookbook. In one recipe, the cook is told to use a ""medium"" sized pan, after switching from a medium pan to a large one, the food still overflowed. In another recipe, garlic is listed as an ingredient but there is no mention of what to do with it in the directions.We still love Rachel but it seems this book was rushed to market. Better off to use a tried and true basic cookbook for kids!"
0,Don't bother,"This is a book that I read to my son many years ago. He loved the story and it was a favorite for both of us.Because it broght back so many good memories, I bought a new copy for my grandson and gave it to him for Christmas. When we sat down to read the story, we discovered that the pages were out of order and some were even upside down. This item will be returned."
1,Sensible approach to diet!,"The doctors Eades debunk much popular diet myth, while presenting logical arguments based in objective research, encouraging us to readopt the diet that has healthfully sustained mankind for literally millions of years.The doctors Eades really struck a chord with me and these days that's not too difficult. It's been my third week off coffee and I've feeling fantastic. The headaches are gone and no more acid stomach thanks to a coffee replacement I found called s o y f e e. Made from soya and I bought it online at www.s oycoffee.com. Simply marvelous, just like this book."

1,must have for rag quilts,"These work great for snipping rag quilts, I was able to do an entire large quilt in one swoop without my hand hurting. The spring action sticks every now and then, if I stop what I'm doing, close it,open it again and make sure the blades are free of lint that seems to stop the issue and it works perfectly again.I was pleased that I did not accidentally snip my seams, the blades are a good length. For the price I think it's a good purchase."
0,Boss digital recorder too complex and too fragile,"I recently purchased the Boss BR-4 track digital recorder and I was somewhat stunned by the complexity involved in using it. If you buy one you going to need to spend a lot of time with the manual. One has to wonder about the investment in time just learning to use this thing, and especially so because my broke down after about a month and is now totally useless and destined for the trash can. Don't know where to send it to be repaired and no doubt they would charge me more than I want to pay. This recorder feels fragile and is not well made. All in all I'd have to say I feel like I was played for a sucker. I'll never buy anything else from Boss."
0,Americas psyco!!!!,"Courtny love is crazy,I mean she throws mic stands at someone in the crowd and injures them and expects pepol to respect her as an artist. aww well,this album is floping anyways so maybe her rain of terror is almost over."
0,Moderate,The book gave insight to the more conservative Amish lifestyles but her explanations for their hard life leaves one to wonder if her husband isn't just a free loader. She is definitely the worker in that family.
1,Awesome book!,"Thank you sincerely for having this very interesting book about the White House; and for the fast service! : )Best,Ron"
0,"Great variety, but shoddy quality.","Cool variety of laser beam heads, if you can actually get them to work and stay on. Definitely not a pro product. Some repeats of designs, and some that you just can't tell what they are. In general I'd rather just buy 1 really good laser pointer than have 42 heads, and only half of them work (kinda)."
1,Do it again.,"If you've seen #1, then this is more of the same. The stories are so good, you'll laugh out loud. The photographs are also great, though I prefer those in #1 by a smidgeon. Oh, yea, there are recipes in this one too. I like the ones that say, ""you can mess with this and it will turn out fine."" I'm not much of a cook, though my husband is."
1,Tossing out the CRT's,"My eyes were weeping constantly with the CRT array in front of me for endless hours. Bought the Cornea and immediately no weeping. I'm replacing all my monitors with LCD's immediately, and this is a financial strain for a start-up business.- jim"

0,Could be better,I was quite dissapointed. To many instructions on how to buy hunting gear but only few good hunting tips. The handbook looks more like school book. I had to wait to find that out more than one mounth and the end price for book and taxes and shipping to Europe came out 45$.
1,VERY PRETTY,"THIS PENDANT IS VERY UNIQUE AND VERY PRETTY. IT'S THE PERFECT SIZE, AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT."

0,Bad product,"Hard to punch the letter on my tool . I bought the graver , they made better and more easier."
0,Don't buy this book.,"Kenneth Copeland claims that heaven is another planet and that God created this earth to be a copy of it.These ideas are totally alien to the historic Christian faith. From the very beginning of Christian history--in fact, from before the time of Christ in faithful Judaism--the people of God have held to the divinely revealed principle that God made everything that exists (meaning there was no other planet on which he was originally based) and that he created everything out of nothing.Thus the Church today teaches: ""We believe that God needs no pre-existent thing or any help in order to create, nor is creation any sort of necessary emanation from the divine substance. God creates freely 'out of nothing'"""
0,A slow book.,It was a slow book.I would not recommend it unless you are bored out of your mind.It is the kind of book that makes you go to sleep.But it has a good ending.

0,Impossible to Assemble.,"The instructions say to ""Insert verticle upright tubes through 2 of the plastic ...support brackets""."" While that sounds like sliding it right through, in fact it's so tight that using WD-40 and a hammer, it still wouldn't slide. Then the plastic bracket split in the middle, (It didn't break at the top or bottom; it split like the seat of your pants) because the upright is too fat for it!Order theMidwest Pet Barrier 11 with 6 Tubular Metal Barsonly if you can get it assembled already. Let them deal with getting the replacement parts needed when you discover it is ""Impossible to Assemble""!"
1,YMSB,Just about everything they do is worth buying and listening to. An excellent album for a new fan or seasoned veteran.
1,So Far So Good,"Did some research, finally took the plunge. First unit I took home had a red pixel stuck on in the lower right part of the screen. Exchanged it for another one and all is well. The fan is kind of noisy and seems to come on a lot but everything works okay. Unit has 3 USB ports instead of the 2 advertised. However, they are USB 1.1 not 2.0. The screen is outstanding when watchingDVD's."
1,Quality product and save money,Amazon shipped the filter as their posted and take a 7-day to arrival after placing the order. It is expected since I use a free shipping.It is a annually replacement item in the refrigerator. This a quality product and save money by order it from Amazon that comparing to buy it from a local store.
0,not good for a morning b4 work exercise routine.,"rarely do i give a negative review, but i hate that the dvd forces you to wait by putting you thru intro's that are non-relevant if all you wanna do is wake-up, quickly workout, and get to your job.it derails from classic joseph pilates style, it is more of a regular (non-pilates) full body workout utilizing the circle prop, that works even your triceps."
0,"Not A Lot Worth Celebrating, Apparently","I own hundreds of science fiction and fantasy books, yet only two (Timothy Zahn's Blackcollar books) are published by Daw. Now I know that's probably not a coincidence. This collection is supposed to be a celebration of Daw's 30th anniversary, yet none of the stories are standouts and several, including Zahn's and Frederik Pohl's, seem to have ""phoned in."" Even C.J. Cherryh's contribution disappoints. Of course, there is no such thing as a perfect anthology, but if you want some provocative sci-fi pick up Universe 1 edited by Robert Silverberg instead of this one."
0,Poor lighting,Although these lights are made of metal they do not have the battery power to keep them on all night long. I have them placed in sufficient sunlight in Arizona and you all know that we have sun here. Their capacity is about 4-6hrs to stay lit. If you are looking for a light that looks good in the daytime this is a fine product but if you are looking for lights to shine on a walkway don't expect light after 10pm.
1,Don't Just Mouse Click -- Buy It!,"The professional reviews that call this the best rock Christmas album ever are on the mark. Don't hesitate. If you aren't in the Christmas spirit yet, this will help get you there. I not only bought a copy for myself, I bought additional copies for friends."
1,Apricorn upgrade package,"I got the Apricorn external hard disk housing and a 500 GB hard drive for a laptop upgrade. I simply used the automatic function of the Apricorn software to clone the new hard drive from the drive in the computer. I replaced the old drive with the new one and the computer booted up and ran normally. The old drive went into the housing for reformat and use as an external backup drive. Since the Apricorn package had the software and I had all needed hardware, I got the new hard drive in an OEM package for even more savings. Delivery from Amazon was prompt and there was very little effort involved in the job."
0,Tips over in deeper snow - Crying bundles of joy,"We live in an area where we can get over 8 inches of snow. When it gets that deep, this product tends to tip over.We've used this for when our kids were like 1 year+ and we had to go around the yard and pack down the snow in a path or else it would tip over, putting our little bundles of joy face down in the snow!If you're only going on a packed snow paths, it's perfectly fine, but we go on the sidewalk then into the fresh snowfall in the backyard, and it never fails to tip over crying, freezing toddlers.Really surprised it's not mentioned in other reviews."
0,wrong area again ooooooooooooo,"Once again I have bought a dvd which is region 0 andI live in region 2 europe. I have fallen into this trap before and thought i was more vigilant in checking the region, but I did not see any guidance.It has only ha[p[pened when ordering from Amazon.com. I will nto use it again, co.uk for me. I read the return policy and it appears I am responsibile so no return."
1,Dion Rocks,"One of my most favourite CDs.Dion has a beautiful singing voice as a solo artist.Most people seem to be most familiar with his material from his days with The Belmonts,but I love both albums on this CD.Each album has a different sound to it.Dion sounds a little spaced out on Born To Be With You.Streetheart has a bluesy peaceful jazz sound to it.Back when I was ten years old,I remember having a""20 original hits,20 original stars""type of album called Blazzing Bullets on eight-track tape,during the days when eight-track tapes were the norm.Dion's Make The Woman Love Me was included on the tape.Buying this CD from the internet in much more recent time,marks my first time ever hearing this song since I was ten.In And Out Of The Shadows is a perfect slow dancing song.I love this song so much,that I sometimes find myself singing along to it.The saxophone is beautifully played in the song Streetheart."
1,fantastic!,I just love this cookbook! It's recipes are easy to follow and the end results are always as good as they look in the accompanying photographs! In my opinion (for what it's worth)'Sydney Food' is better than anything that Jamie Oliver or Nigella Lawson has to offer!
1,Good electric toothbrush,It took me a long time to pick an electric toothbrush. All the reviews on amazon.com were very helpful. I bought this version and I have no regrets. This electric toobrush works really well and comes with 4 brush heads. My teeth feel nice and clean; the same feeling I have when I leave the dentist after a cleaning. Make sure you read the directions so you know all the features that this toothbrush has.
1,Great Show,"I purchased this on a whim when it went on sale, and it did not disappoint. This is probably the funniest show I have ever seen. There are so many undertones and jokes that it takes a second viewing to fully understand. The only problem is that the show got dropped and there were only 3 seasons!In terms of quality, it is standard for a TV series. The first season is a slightly lesser video quality than the next 2, as is with all TV series (because they don't know if the show will get picked up or continued).You should have bought this yesterday. Seriously."
1,Nunca he perdido la Fe!,"Con esta frase quiero transmitir uno de los descubrimientos más espectaculares del Sendero Espiritual al que uno puede llegar una vez que lee las palabras del Arcángel Miguel y de la Señora Fe. En una página notable Ellos develan la Verdad de que eso de ""perder la Fe"" es imposible ya que siempre ""la andamos trayendo"" en la Llama de Dios que está en el corazón. ¿Qué es lo que sucede a menudo? Que uno coloca esa Fe en personas, sitios, condiciones y hasta cosas que no son constructivas por lo que se experimenta angustia, tristeza, desilusión... que no son más que enfocar equivocadamente ese tremendo poder de la Fe. Gracias a Dios he aprendido lo efectiva que es la Fe cuando la coloco en lo que es bueno y elevador!"
0,Disapointed,This seemed like a good idea but some of the tea comes through the covering and settles in the cup
0,IT CAUGHT ON FIRE.,"I work an incredibly high stress job, have an extremely tight jaw and neck, and was really excited about this. My doctor recommended I try one. I loved it, the first two times I used it. I followed the instructions to the T, and warmed it at 30 second intervals.Then it caught fire in my microwave.I'm serious - as it turns out, it has a metal zipper pull. I heard a pop from the kitchen and opened the microwave to discover the zipper pull had fired off and the material around the zipper was charring.So, yeah, cloves and lavender smell great. Burning synthetic material = not so much.I wouldn't recommend to anyone who's looking to lesson the stress in your life."
1,Ramage the Spy,"In which Lt. Ramage speaks with Lord Nelson and smugglers alike, takes passage for ""Boney's"" France, is astounded and becomes a shipwright, employs a thief, speaks to a policman of knives and sealing wax, and joins the French army! One suspects that Liberty - Equality - Fraternity meant only the liberty to reduce your brother citizens into equal misery. Of course, the British Navy's blockade also had something to do with the desperate state of the French economy revealed here (and rarely depicted in other seafaring series).If you like stories of the Napoleonic era you'll enjoy this close up view of the French Terror into which idealists descended, but if your desire is only battle at sea this volume will disappoint. As far as I know this is the only nautical novel that brings its naval hero so far and long into enemy France (perhaps Pope is fulfilling the promise of C.S. Forester's ""Hornblower During The Crisis"" left unfinished by Forester's death before HH gets ashore)."
1,A Beautiful Listening Experience,"A punishing disk. stripped down, dirty, and brutal...it loosens fillings,fuses vertebrae,causes nosebleeds...everything I could ask for. In particular, Get Away, SOS, and Body Bomb provide a perfect soundtrack to bludgeoning (this is a good thing!)A great companion on long stretches of highway."
1,This course is incredible!!,"This course is an absolute knockout. It's very well organized and modular. The amount of learning that is involved with learning how to be a DBA can be a bit daunting. This video-coarse presents a lot of material in a very skilled manner. The video lectures are very well thought out and the book is very straightforward and informative. These instructors have taught at Columbia University's CTA Program and their depth of knowledge and experience is evident in these lessons. Possibly the best thing about this course is the fact that the authors created it with the student in mind. In the end, the emphasis is on the education of the STUDENT, not just the education of the instructor. I hope they continue with the video-course concept, it works really well!!"
1,Gary Kicks 'butt'!,"This 1992 release by Gary Richrath really kicks 'butt'. Gary's new band with Michael Janz sounds very similar to old REO and Kevin.This album has a 1980 REO sound, very similar to ""Nine Lives"" or ""Tuna Fish"" albums. All songs very strong to fairly stong. Gary's guitar never sounded better and Michael Janz's voice is great. If you ever wondered how REO would sound today with Gary in charge, this will show you. When I listen to all the REO albums since Gary left, I think of how much better they would sound with Gary. REO has no edge now. We can only hope that one day we'll get to hear that again!"
0,game,I ordered the wrong one as i am not a fan of role playing games. I tried playing but did not find it to my liking. My preference are strategy type games
0,Headlines (Friendship Never Ends) video???,"does not have the video Headlines (Friendship Never Ends), the cover of the cd says it has more on the dvd it does not appear. I felt cheated."
0,HUGE disappointment,"We should be celebrating the ultimate release of some of our eras best loved films: the superior extended release film versions with all the additional documentary content included with the deluxe dvd versions in the amazing aural and visual clarity of Blue-ray high definition. Instead we get the inferior theatrical release with none of the added content. What can be gained from this, other than additional revenue at the expense of a supporting fanbase? Do not buy these watered down Blue-ray versions, instead hold out for the extended version release which is eventually to come."
0,Chewing jerky bear,"It was hard when it arrived. It took awhile to soften up, even then, it was still hard. It was like chewing on beef jerkey. Not worth the sale price."
0,NEVER AGAIN,"This is the second RCA DVD player I've had in less than 4 years. The first started freezing and I would have to unplug the unit for a couple of minutes to reset it. Finally it just quit altogether. I'd had it a little over 2 years.I received this model for Christmas 2007. My boys bought it for me so I hardly felt I could take it back even though that was my first thought on seeing the RCA label. Surely this model would be better? NO! This one has done the same thing though it gave me no warning. After turning on the power it does nothing except say WELCOME. Of course it was one month out of warranty. Now there are 5 DVD's stuck inside, two of which are rentals and no one from customer service will respond. RCA obviously stands for Real Cr** America."
1,wonderful CD---received it in short time---in new condition and great !!,"The CD arrived in a very short time and I was surprised that I received it in new, perfect condition. The CD is wonderful and I am very happy that I got it."
1,Nice gun,"It is a little heavy, but has plenty of power. And nails are easy to find.For the price it is worth it."
1,"Night Angel 9: Lifeflight- Night Angel 9: Playing with Fire,",These books are very well written. Mr. Telep certainly did his homework. You feel as though you know the characters as you readthrough each of the series of these books. The events in these books are real life and make you take stock of what you have. You come to have a much greater respect for the jobs that these people do and feel fortunate that they are there if you need them. Mr. Telep has a way of pulling you into each book. You feel like you are along for the ride. We have had a hard time putting these books down to take care of regular business. We have read each and everyone of the Night Angel series and hope that he will come out with additonal books for this series soon.Thank You
1,Let Down,"Harryq is correct. The album sounds great and all, but the overall release could've been made sweeter. like he said, the album isn't even gatefold. there isn't any special tracks or anything else like that either. also, in the insert with all of the lyrics has quite a few typos. on top of all that, disc 1's hole was too small to fit on my record player and i had to make the hole bigger to play it. the LP release was disappointing."
1,Blast from the Past!,"It's been such fun returning ""back in the day"" with my son. He is 21 months old, although it's before Elmo's time, he still enjoys watching it! A must have for Sesame Street Fans of all ages."

0,Problems with these dvds,"This mini-series, on 2 dvds has an excellent cast. It appears to also have a good and believable story line. However, there is no close captioning. That would normally be alright for those of use with hearing problems because we can wear headphones and turn up the volume. In this case that doesn't work. The music, war sounds and ambient sounds in the film are so loud that they drown out 85 - 90% of the speaking. I was unable to hear little more than 4 to 5 scenes. I had to guess what was happening. I am extremely frustrated and angry. I wasted both my time and money on this mini-series. I am a disabled senior citizen and reading books (from Amazon) and movies are about all I am able to do. I have very little money and so to have spent it on this was very disconcerting."
0,A disappointment,The soundtrack was a real disappointment. Some of the songs on the cd were not in the movie and must have been some of the first songs recorded by Beyonce because they were terrible.
1,The White Deer,"An excellent story for all ages. How nice it is to maintain innocence,Thurber combines wit and humor to this beautiful little book."
0,Wasted my money,"I purchased this based on some other reviews only to find every track has singing (I've never gotten used to the sound)and, unless you do forkloric type dance, there was NOTHING to move my hips!"
0,A real piece of junk,"Don't waste your money as the guitar would not tune. Contacted seller Austin Bazaar and they sent me a RMA but will not reimburse the $18.85 shipping to return the item. Bought this for my grandson and my son who has been playing guitars for 20 years could not tune this junk. Also, still waiting for credit for full cost of this so-called merchandise. Have filed a claim with Amazon under their A-Z program but heard nothing so far. This is a big headache and suggest you not buy this item and save yourself from the trouble. I can only hope since I am a regular customer that Amazon will honor my claim and reimburse me the $18.85. Will update everyone later after this is resolved. Can't believe any of the good reviews and wonder what those folks were smoking or if they ever played even a half-way decent beginners guitar. The price should have warned me but..."
0,do not buy this variety pack,"i have been buying Stoneridge Orchards products for a long time, so i decided to try the variety pack for quick snacks. not only the product seems inferior to their regular packages, but also, the pouches were half open in the box. what a rip off"
0,Don't buy this crap,"I bought this one a few years ago. It looked great and worked great, too, for over 1 year. I actually used it for about 10 times. Then, the battery was dead. You MUST disassemble it to pieces in order to get out the battery. I just throw it away."
1,People will write songs about this game (and they did!),"The Best Game In The World. Nothing comes close. I've been playing video and PC games since 1982 and I have never played anything this long without getting bored and moving on to another game. I got this game 2 years ago and it is still my most played game. Heck, I even rented my own Counter-Strike Server and made two websites devoted to the game. Dosen't that tell you something? Close to half a million players are online at any given time. The second most played online game don't even have 1/4 the user-base that counter-Strike has. Dosen't that tell you something also? You don't need a fast computer to run it. The learning curve is actually pretty long, but you'll have so much fun you don't care.Get this game by all means!"
1,Comfy intelliwarmth aerobed,I would have given the bed a five-star rating if I hadn't had to buy a thick poly-filled pad to go under the bed cover. I bought the pad because when the bed is blown up the ridges (that are very firm) that I felt bugged me and kept me from sleeping. With the pad the bed is perfect. The heat it gives off is awesome. My two dachshunds and I love it now!
1,Nashville is Worth the Hype,"After watching the first three episodes of Nashville, I can definitely say that Nashville is worth the hype it received in promotion. Excellent writing, acting, music and storylines. Nashville has it all.The characters are well developed with what first appear to be stereotypical stock characters flowering into aching, yearning human beings. Deacon in particular doesn't do what the viewer expects. The setting is original and well captured as well and a refreshing change of pace from the usual doctor, lawyer and police procedurals. The music runs the gamut in country styles from classic to pop and is a real addition to the show and I say this as a person who isn't necessarily a fan of country music...but I love this. A home run for ABC."
0,Let's not confuse things.,"Actually, I find the argument that these books should be judged simply on their own terms to be absurb, especially since the fabrication of JT Leroy was used to lure readers to the books in the first place. In other words, the books are fiction but the marketing device to get us to read them was a lie, pure and simple. So that's how these writings by Laura Albert should be understood--not as a stand-alone works of fiction but as a marketing tool to fool the public into buying them. If the hoax of JT Leroy shouldn't matter in regard to the books than why, I wonder, was it used in the first place?"
1,The Gingery Charcoal-Fired Furnace,"This is a great book, and the best that I have found so far on getting started in foundrywork.It covers all of the essentials, and guides you step-by-step through the process of building your charcoal-fired furnace. No prior experience in any form of metalworking or handicrafts is required, although some carpentry experience is rather useful. I am a full-time welding and machining student, and this(and Dave's other books in this series), are literally a dream come true.If you enjoy tinkering with stuff, and dream about being a machinist/foundryman/all-around do-it-yourselfer, then you owe it to yourself to get this book, and the others in the series.Have fun!"
1,OMG,"If you buy this, do not watch it until you have time to watch the whole thing. It is awesome. It is a little irritating that you cannot fast forward through the Showtime ads and previews in between episodes. If it were not for that I would have given 5 stars."
0,Yucky coffee,"This is such a great idea and seemed perfect for my house, where I am the only one who likes coffee. The problem is, it doesn't make good coffee. No matter how fresh my coffee grounds, the coffee comes out tasting burned, watery and stale. I have not been able to figure it out, but after reading other reviews I think maybe the problem was that the coffee grounds may have splattered into the water reserve, and I can never get the taste of old stale coffee grounds out of my new coffee. I finally got rid of it after trying it 10 or 12 times."
1,money saver,ive had my espresso maker for over three months now and love it! the espersso is sooo good! i compared it with my local coffee stores and cant tell much of a differece well except for the price i pay for a cup. ive saved money making it at home and enjoy mixing up my own recipes.... the flaw of this machine is the frother. it is in an awkward position and makes steaming milk difficult without the right cup. but when you wiggle it a little it works good.. all in all great machine really worth the money
0,Pervasive Silicone Enhancement,"Flat lighting, cheap sets and costumes, dull dialog, wooden acting, and a goofy plot; even pervasive silicone enhancement can not save this movie. Zero stars should be an option. For more inspired soft porn, check out the work of Andrew Blake (andrewblake.com)."
1,"Simple part, super solution","The old gas guzzler has been sucking gas through a thin straw... well... I just swapped out the old filter with the new and the car has regained some pep. After getting all the fuel out of the old filter, I could tell it was noticeably heavier than the new one... that extra weight was the sludge trapped in the filter!Changing the filter was super easy, minus getting the hoses removed from the old one. Once they slipped onto the new one, they were snug enough to leave on without clamps, but I tightened the clamps on anyways.The other 'challlenge' was locating the fuel pump's relay, which I could never find despite all the documents and 'maps' I used... It was much more simpler to find the power plug for the fuel pump and umplug it.... all for the purpose of relieving pressure in the line before the replacement."
0,Nothing quite as frustrating as an extended intellectual misfire,"I appreciate brevity. Seems to me most commentary and analysis goes on too long. That was my attraction to this title, but that's not the problem here. Every topic is handled concisely though often not very effectively. The problem here is a twisted central view that produces sheer nuttiness like this books anachronistic take on Freud. I wish I had more time to elaborate, but, suffice it to say, you WILL be disappointed. This book is about a dozen re-writes from something worthwhile, and I wish I'd looked the reference section over a little more rigorously before wasting my money on this tome."
1,Tamron lens,"Have had the 'itch' for a new general purpose lens for a while, and saw this one. With the price, and the features, seemed hard to pass up. My order was received quickly, and the lens is everything it says it is...I would like to see it focus a little faster...it seems to need more light than my other lenses to hit the focus point clearly, but other than that, this is a very nice product. My shots are clearer, and cleaner than with my other lenses, and the 62 mm size brings in a lot more light. A great general purpose lens. Shipping was extremely prompt, and Tamron was more than timely with the rebate. An outstanding buy. Highly recommended."
1,Deeply Moving,"As I read this book, I felt I was there, with each character, as she related her life. I found myself in tears many times and thinking of the characters when I wasn't reading. Ms. Austin is a gifted writer with much to say. If you haven't read Fly Away, you should. It, too, is wonderful."
1,Croquet set,"Well constructed, great fun for the family. Heavy duty so will not break after one use. Great to get kids away from video games"
1,Great mineral-oil free product,"I looked high and low to find a wood oil that actually has no mineral oil in it. I use this product on my butcher blocks and it's great. Remember, even though products say made of ""natural"" mineral oil, it's still a petroleum product.Update: Been using for three weeks and this product works great. My countertops look great and are well protected."
0,.net lacking,This product does not include the upgrade wizard for visual basic 6.0 scripts. In order to get the upgrade wizard you must buy the whole visual studio package which costs [much] more. Just another way to make a little more money!!
1,good to have a Christmas perfume,It is not easy to find a Christmas perfume besides those that Bath and Body Works have. And Nuit de Noel is and old perfume our great grandmas wore.
0,Poor Product,"This product did not meet my needs. First, it does not connect to an iPhone. Second, it broke apart the first time that I tried to use it. Third, it's just generally poor manufacturing. I threw it away instead of returning."
0,low quality compared to other authors,"I got this book a couple months ago. It is a mixture of logical principles on how to be succesful with the major principle being ""Set Goals"".You could get Earl Nightingale's tapes for free on the internet that will tell you this and much more.Half this book is filled with this phrase: ""When I wrote Chicken Soup for the Soul, which became a multimillion bestseller..."", again and again and again.This book reads like a big advertisement to Chicken Soup for the Soul ""And now we have a CSFTS fom Farmers and one for Pets and one for Mothers..."".It is boring and slowly paced.Anyway, Jack Canfield belongs to the Bob Proctor school, so I guess it should make more sense to read Bob Proctor instead, or James Artur Ray which is his best student."
1,MY FAVORITE FOO FIGHTERS RECORD!,"damn i love this album! best foo fighters album to date. its easy to see that these songs are the most playable of any in thefoo fighters collection (just ahead of The Colour And Shape). All My Life and Times Like These are definite foo fighters classics. low, have it all, halo, lonely as you and overdrive are awesome too!! honestly the first 9 or 10 songs are A grade. the rest is about at a B. if your just getting into the foo fighters i recommend buying this album right now! and if a long time fan you will find some of the best sounds the foos have ever produced :)!!"
1,Exceeded My Expectations,"After reading lots of positive reviews I gave the book a try, although I was not fully sold on the concept. I'm glad I did as this was one of the more enjoyable reads I've had in the past year,"
0,Deserves less stars-DO NOT READ,"This book was just plain horrible. Seriously! It is not worth the paper it was printed on. It is a half-developed story about a young woman who falls into some sort of ""witch"" cult where there is sacrifice and sex rites and it was all very, very creepy. All I saw it as was a way to perpetuate a myth of pagans being devil worshippers who have orgies and kill people.Don't waste your time!"
1,great first season,"The first episode grabs you and keeps you hooked for the rest of the season. ""Alias"" was at times an uneven show, but the first season is action-packed and exciting and definitely worth watching!"
1,"Controversial, but great","Many reviewers have weighed in with strong opinions, but if you enjoy Aimee Mann's music, this CD belongs in your collection. This is the first Aimee Mann album to include many of the songs I have heard her perform in concert over the years, but have never been able to buy on CD. Controvery aside, the songs are great, and they flow together beautifully. Hear for yourself."
1,Different and interesting,"A friend introduced me to this cookbook. Tired of making the same recipes, I was looking for something different. This is certainly it. So far, so good. Some of the recipes are a little beyond my effort, interest, and skill range, but for the most part I am pleased. Try the apricot chocolate chip cookies - amazing."
0,Highly Imaginative Christmas Tale!,"This Evanovich book is a detour through the holidays that one may take to escape the pressures of the season. The usual characters from the series of mysteries show up for this amusing, if highly unlikely, Christmas tale. Reading this book will feel like ""home"" for Evanovich fans, but do not expect the thrills and chills and depth of story line that readers usually enjoy in Stephanie Plum books. This is a ""twinkle"" of a book, just right for a light weight read."
1,Good introduction to chapter books,"I got this book to introduce my 4 year old daughter to the concept of chapter books. She loves it and feels like a ""big girl""."
1,Keeps the smell contained-major bonus!,It's amazing how well this diaper pail keeps in the odor. My husband and I didn't realize it until we opened it up to take out the bag. Love this product..a must!!
0,Translation written by an apostate to Christianity,"If you are a Christian looking to get deeper into the word of God Beware that the author of this book is an apostate to Christianity, having promoted the old heretical swoon theory in his book the Passover Plot. He offers himself as a scholar of the most liberal sort. Denying the resurrection,deity and sacrificial sufferings of Christ for the sins of the world. The cult of liberal theology is neither Christian nor scholarly but are of the ravenous wolves type seeking to devour unsuspecting sheep. Save your money for other great books that can build up your most holy faith."
0,wow this was terrible,"terrible movie. I do not recommend. I like some awful stuff, but this is just ridiculous. I like ""entertaining"" movies... I consider them different from ""Good"" movies...this was neither... just bad bad bad."

1,DIPSET IS TAKING OVER,"Out of the haters and clowns who knock dipset I respect them highly.Real regonize real and only a ""real person"" can understand where Hell Rell, Cam'ron, Juelz Santana, Freeky Zeek,JR Writer, 40 Cal, Ja Ja, Max B, and my baby Jim Jones is coming from. There's NOT ONE dipset mixtape or album I don't have or know or don't approve of. It's like the people who need to be regonized is never regonized enough. If you don't like dipset you minds well not even listen to rap. It's all about realness, your G-ed up swager, your own apperance and way of doings things,how street you really are, and how your differnt. It's always better to stand out then be the same. And that's what Dipset does. So who don't mess wit the Dips then we know where you stand. Don't get me wrong a lot of good music is out there and a twice as much as of fake G's Claiming to be IT but ISN'T. So I ma leave as liten, learn and you will like the Dips."
1,Voyage of Steve Hackett,"Voyage of the Acolyte is actually the first Genesis solo album (one minor error in Paul Clark's nice review). This solo album came out before Peter Gabriel's first solo album. It was recorded in June & July of 1975 just after the Lamb Lies Down on Broadway Tour. Peter Gabriel had just left the band, and Genesis had yet to record Trick of the Tail (November, December 1976). Steve Hackett's first solo voyage shows the depth of creativity which he only continued to expand throughout his post-Genesis solo career which began after his departure following the Wind & Wuthering tour. Steve continues to this day to do things most rock musicians wouldn't, or couldn't, do (like record a CD with the Royal Phil, or play the Vivaldi guitar concerto with the English Chamber Orch). The cover is one of many of the beautiful pieces of art work done by Steve's wife, Brazilian artist Kim Poor (greatly praised by Salvador Dali)."
1,awesome game,"I have 2 ATVs so I had to get this game.First off the atvs are very detailed and the graphics are excellent.The freestyle course is awesome,you can get serious air time.The thing I did notice was that the game designers have the Lakota and Mojave sounding like 2 strokes when they are 4 stroke engines,the same way with the Polaris 400,it is a 2 stroke and they made it sound like a 4.When you race against the computer it always seems to cheat.The computer can jump alot farther than you can,and they get up faster when they crash.Other than those querks the game is really good."
0,Boogie Woogie Man,A very repiticious CD with poor sound quality on several of the tracks. I would probably not listen to this CD again and consider it a waste of money.
0,The changing of the guard redux,"This is one of the most amazingly disappointing cds I have ever bought.I have been a Dan fan almost since the inception. While the sound of this anemic collection of tunes is Steely Dan, all the wit and brilliance that once gave this band its unique appeal is gone. There are no soaring insturmental solos, no polished satiric lyrics. While the additude of ripe debauchery that this band espoused in ts early work appears rakish on one still in youth, the very over indulgent lifestyle celibrated by this band has dulled the razor sharp neural edge that made them so outstanding. The cd is dull and witless, not quite a stinker but almost."
1,Velvet Angel,"I have been reading Jude Deveraux novels for years. She describes everything with such detail that I feel as though I am a character in her novels. I can almost taste the food being served, feel the wind, rain, or sun on my skin, and the clothes would be lovely hanging in my closet! I highly recommend all of her novels. I am actually reading some of them for the second time. Thank you, Ms. Deveraux for sharing your talent with the world."
1,Amazing Job,"This book takes a look at an aspect of politics we usually don't think about---- how the actions of politicians teach children lessons contrary to those taught by most parents. The book presents a well-researched look at various scandals during the Clinton Administration, governmental and media reaction to them, and, most importantly, the subtle messages they sent to children about accountability and truth.What is truly amazing is that this book was written by a 17 year old high school student. The perspective is one we don't often see. Although my own political posture does not mirror the author's, I must agree with his overall premise. He has made some very thoughtful observations about American values.The book is easy to read, and I highly recommend it."
0,Never Worked!,"The only thing gained from this toy is child and parental fruatration. Film doesn't advance, flash doesn't work..."
1,Life on the road to California with 4000 Texas Long Horns with a little romance thrown-in along with tragedy,"The author did such a fantastic job describing the mountains, terrains, and the rivers, I felt as though I was there. There was also some comedy not only with the love-birds, but others which kept me laughing between tragidies as they ocurred. I have read about 25 books and they keep getting better. There is one co-author whom I did not care for. One of the books was ""By The Horns"". I don't remember The title of the other book. All in all, I think the books can't get any better, but I know that I will be on the edge of my chair as I read the next book."
0,Honeymoon Over,"The first week I had this I was pretty impressed. However, the second week I started getting run-error messages and the program wouldn't open anymore. The support site they give for this problem seems to be non-existent (at least Google can't find it) and tech support is pretty lame: there is none on weekends.That's when I have time to use it.Who wants to wait two to three days to get response to an e-mail or to use a program I paid good money for? I have a program that won't run and no help to get it going. A waste of money, so far, and I'm pretty angry!"
0,Awful stats textbook,"I hated this book, and I only bought it because it was required for my homework assignments. If you choose not to go to class or need the text for extra help with concepts and equations, well, you're in trouble. There are a lot of Greek symbols and theoretical equations, but few practical examples that would help you learn to solve problems. I had the author for my professor, and his lectures were totally different from how things are presented in the text (and much more informative and useful). If you don't absolutely NEED the book for homework problems, I would recommend not buying it and simply attending lecture."
0,A Happy Hour of good stuff but its an 88 minute movie,"What if one brand of beer became addictive because of a new taste additive? Marshal beer has become so, against this compulsive background of swilling are hilarous commercials, a secretary (Tawny Kitaen)with many talents (belching, holding her breath underwater, but alas not typing!),Jamie Farr as Crummy Fred - a screwball detective/jack of all trades who amuses himself by using a scoped pellet gun on girls playing beach vollyball among his other fun activities of mayhem...And Rich Little as a james bond type operative. I cain't call it a good movie, but it has several fun parts."
0,Super Granny 3,"I like this game but unfortunately you have to leave the disc in the computer to use it. If I take the disc out, I have to reinstall every time due to some copy write problem. I don't seem to have this if I buy from Big Fish games."
0,Bad Feature,"This would be a good remote except for one unfortunate feature. Philps calls it ""TV punch through"" volume controls. The buttons on the remote for vol+, vol-, and mute will only operate the TV volume, regardless of what mode you are in. So even though you programed an amp into the remote, the volume controls will only operate the TV volume. This would be nice if you don't have an amplifier, but most people who have need of a 7 device remote use an amp.It is possible to ""learn"" the amp volume controls onto other buttons, but that makes for confusion. Remotes are confusing enough already.The Philips 5 device remote has this same unfortunate feature (I bought that model first!!)I returned my Philips remote and bought a One For All remote that lets me choose which device I can assign the volume controls to."
1,"Nice, portable and easy to operate GPS unit","That's my 3rd unit of this kind, the others got stolen and this might be the only problem with it. Take with you or make sure you hide the unit well in all times. Besides that, I love it, I think the size is perfect (very portable but still with a decent screen size) and very easy to operate."
0,Enough with the ZEN already!,"I was forced to read this book quite literaly against my religon. If you're in to ZEN, if you're really really in to ZEN, you might enjoy this book, but for everyone who does things besides contamplating how paint drys, this book will provide little more entertainment than watching a comercial marathon on television."
0,Mew is for Murder,"I love crime mystery stories, but this one was just fair. Too many pages and words were wasted describing the club scene; something that has never been my interest. The story itself was too far-fetched for me. The cat points out the hiding place of its mistress? First time I've ever heard of a bloodhound cat!Sorry, the only good thing about this book for me was the cheap price."
0,beware the dvd version; as sold by 1st video.,"I bought the dvd version, currently selling for $13.99; what a mistake to make! This version is by a company in Canada, called, I believe, Lance Entertainment. It is ""cut"" for language, nudity, and violence, by 5 minutes, at least. Buyer beware. If you don't mind it, then, buy it (I prefer my movies ""uncut"" which is why I tried to sell my copy, contacted 1st video, they suggested I sell it at a store [which I plan to])."
0,"Good for a Year, then bad","I got the Sony DVP NC600 as a home theater system for Christmas in 2001. It was great and very easy to hook up. It worked great. However, after a year the CD player will play a music CD for about 30 mins and the whole system will then just power off by itself. The warranty expired, and now Sony wants me to pay a min of [$$$] to fix. Unbelieveable! Would I purchase another Sony CD player, probably not for a long time."
0,No good!,"Stay away from this one! the video transfer sucks, PLUS, it was edited so it lacks the nudity scene. Total play time is 84 min, not 90 or 94 as per their listing."
0,"The ratings are down,and so is the game","Everyone told me this game was going to be like no mercy.like when tap the grab button,then you can perform a weak move,or if you press and hold the grab button,you can do a strong move,not on here when you press the A button they do a move quick and in a hurry Smackdown just bring it style,i pick Hulk Hogan,hes comming out with some stupid music,so did Hall and nash...you move by useing the stick and not the D-pad,which [stinks]BRING BACK THE PEOPLE WHO DID NO MERCY!"
0,PIECE OF JUNK,"Not two months old and it is not heating past 250 degrees no matter what the setting. It is under warranty ...if you have the box, pack it carefully so they can't blame the packaging for the problem, pay to have it shipped and insured, and include $18.95 to have it send back ....even if the product is defective. No thanks, it is my first and last Euro Pro Product and Buyer Beware!"
0,Metal casing causes electrostatic discharges - your data is zapped!,"No-one seems to have mentioned a major flaw with the Cruzer Titanium. The (admittedly very stylish) metal casing can cause electrostatic discharges. This usually occurs just as you are about to insert the drive into your computer. If this happens, not only will all data on the drive be zapped, the drive will become completely unusable.It's a shame: the drive looks great and I hate putting my data on the flimsy plastic alternatives, but once you've been zapped, you'll never by a Titanium again."
0,Might work for some babies...,"My son was born in December. I had a HORRIBLE time finding a nice warm winter hat for a boy. I ordered this and have some mixed reviews. It's defiantly thick and warm. It's not super soft--but that's okay. It never really fit my son though. It's a 0-6 month hat and even in the early months it didn't fit. The ""band"" part was always too small and the rest of it stood up like an elf hat. My son's head at birth was in the 60 percentile. I'm not sure how this could fit many 6 month olds..."
1,It is awesome!,"I like this EDT very much! It is sooo sexy. In Europe this smell is very popular. When men wear this perfume women follow them :). My husband always was a fan of ""Drakkar"" and nothing else. Once I brought a piece of paper sprayed by this perfume and left on the counter and my husband asked me what is this, it is smell soo awesome! So, after that i bought this EDT for him as a gift on Valentin's day. And it is definitely an original one (size 2.5 oz)."
0,cute movie ruined dvd,"WB ruined the dvd of ""It takes two"" by releasing it in full screen only. it was filmed in widescreen. re-release it in letterboxx."
0,the theme of Terraforming Mars deserves a better author,"I ordered all three of these books,thinking they would be a treat. Alas, I fell asleep over Red Mars, but I finished that one, just because I hoped it would get better. But Green and Blue MArs were to much to endure, boring characters going through improbable adventures and getting immortal in the process; that is if they were not killed in the full scale war between the settlers of Mars and the bad guys from Earth that they author envisaged. Really, it was totally uninspired and to boring to endure!"
0,Stopped working after three minutes.,"I bought this for a trip to Italy. My wife used it with her blow dryer for the first time and after about three minutes it died. For five days we thought it was her blow dryer. My wife was on the verge of trashing her dryer. We found out later that it was the adapter and not her dryer. We bought a really cheap adapter for two euros and she was able to use her blow dryer with out a problem for the rest of the trip. Since we took the instructions with us, and followed everything it said, I'm hoping we can return the product. We also double checked to make sure that the voltage on the dryer was set correctly.I wouldn't waste my time or money on this product."
0,Interesting but tedious,"This is my first Mieville book, and it was less thrilling than expected. I couldn't get into the characters or the plot, at least til the very end. I found the language almost trying too hard to be ""unique"", and it made it less pleasant to read. I'll try it again after I read Perdido Street Station, however."
1,"Bang, Buck, yada yada yada",I bought these to match a set of rotors to fit our company car (2006 Impala). This car gets abused and left to sit outside year round. I figured I would go cheap as I will probably have to replace brakes quite often. I'm pleasantly surprised at how well these are holding up. These are as good or better than original and the price doesn't even come close to what original sells for. I recommend these for all around everyday driving and commuting.
0,broke in under a year,"If I wrote my review shortly after installing as many of the other reviewers did, I could give 5 stars too-- it works fine in the beginning! Mine is no longer holding chain tension after less a year of use on a Yuba Mundo cargo bike. I plan to replace it soon with a higher grade component."
1,the only one I'll ever need....,"I am new to belly dancing, taking a beginner course once a week. I realize I need more practice than what is offered in class, so I came to Amazon searching Beginner Belly Dance videos. I read so many good reviews about so many DVDs, I didn't know which one to pick. I decided to go with this one, for $7.99 and 240 minutes worth of instruction. I AM SO GLAD I DID. This disc is ALL I am going to need to supplement my practice at home. I just hit pause and turn on some tribal fusion music and practice each move after the BEAUTIFUL and articulate Leila of Egypt introduces them. She spends time repeating them herself, on the DVD, but I need like 5 minutes of solid practice, PER MOVE. So having a DVD to start and stop is perfect."
0,Don't waste your money!!!,"I love trying new products and am always excited when I find something I can't live without. This is not one of those products. Okay, it has a nice pepperminty taste and it has some exfoliating properties, but you can get the same effect by rubbing a wet washcloth across your lips. Really; the price is high and the shipping is also high for this tiny tube of various seed oils. I recommend Aveeno lip conditioner in chapstick form with an SPF of 15, much better. I did order more than one item from Philosophy to make the shipping a little easier to accept, but still this product is not worth the price."
1,Its good,This game is a pretty good game. Now here I screwed up because I played MGS2 first but then I got this game. Now I must say it is a very good game but now a days it would have horrible graphics but I truly don't care about graphics. You really should buy this game before you buy MGS2 or else you won't understand 80% of MGS2. Also this game is really hard if you you play on Extreme mode so it does get frustrating sometimes. Really the only reason I give this game 4 stars is because of the graphics but if I could I would give it 4 and 3/4 stars. If you dont care about the storyline then you should just buy MGS2 because its graphics are like 100 times better.
0,stopped working after 1 year 3 months,I had a bad feeling when this unit arrived. Worked ok for a while then after about 9 months various buttons started malfunctioning. Very cheap parts. the most cheap feeling stereo I have ever purchased. I wish I went with my gut and returned this piece of garbage in the beginning. I have since bought a pioneer deh 4300 and it works great. If you have an ipod the pioneer 4300 works great with it. I have an ipod touch. I wish I went with the pioneer in the beginning instead this unit. I wanted hd radio. It works alright but I live in orange county just south of L.A. It cuts out enough to be annoying. Factor that in with the extremely cheap radio its housed in and one year later its done. Not surprising it broke so fast when you see how cheap this thing is made. As far as hd radio goes when its not cutting out it sounds great. I think I will wait until they get hd radio working better before I go this route again. Dual should be ashamed of making radios this bad.
1,A true American classic.,Jimmy Stewart at his best. Great family entertainment. One of very few examples of a movie that I enjoyed more than the stage play.
0,Average CD,"Ginuwine hasn't made the CD I know he's capable of making. This is lightweight stuff. He's in need of better material and proper management. G; I suggest you work with Rodney Jerkins, Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, Joe & Joshua P. Thompson, Kevin ""Skes'pere"" Briggs, The Neptunes, The Underdogs: Damon Thomas & Harvey Mason, Jr., Daryl Simmons and go back to Timbaland & Missy for one of their funky futuristic tunes."
1,Eminem's Slim Shaddy is better than the candy!,"Before I bought Slim Shaddy LP, I borrowed it and listened to it. Before that I thought Eminem was just some guy who wanted to be the new Vanilla Ice. But, even though some lyrics are messed up, this CD is a lot better than I could have possibly imagined. Eminem's team up with Dr Dre improved the sound of songs like Guilty Conscience."
0,Spanx,They are okay however the waistband keeps rolling so not really what I am looking for as it bunches up at waist and not a smooth look like I thought it would be.
0,A worthwhile topic but lacking focus and proportion.,"Brokaw's thesis is that a generation tested by (a) the Depression, and (b) WWII, rose to the challenge and deserves our respect and admiration. This may be true, but Brokaw does not prove it. His book lacks the kind of rich specificity which would be convincing. For the various people he interviews, he gives us very little on how they survived the Depression. And as the book advances, we get less and less of the particulars of how the subjects experienced the war. The problem may be that there are too many subjects, or interviewees, to be handled with the thoroughness or depth that is finally convincing. At the end, we are left only with the warm feeling that they have survived, and we can all be grateful for that, but not with a sense that we have come finally to know them, especially in their past, and how that past has shaped them, which is, after all, the point of the book."
1,More relevant today than in the '70's!,"Outstanding!! More relevant today than in the '70's. A very easy read on what's really going on with Goverment, and its relationship with ""we the people""Take the time to read it. You wont regret a minute of it!"
1,A Difficult but Intriguing Read,"This book is so baffling, no reader should feel bad about not understanding it. It is innovative and wonderful in its courage to experiment with new kinds of forms. There are also moments that are very funny. It reminds me somewhat of Eastern European novels (Transatlantyk and A Little Hungarian Pornography) in its attempt to challenge the reader. Vizenor is a Native American writer, and his book is an important part of the Native American Literature canon."
0,It's a Pass,"I'd have to agree with the first reviewer. this one is not worth your time. i had very high expecations as i love this genre of illustration and graphic design... and there was hardly any content! i'm not even sure how they actually had enough pages to bind this book. the cover was the most exciting part. Look to some great titles like ""UNCOVERED: the hidden art of the girlie pulps"" and you'll be much more satisfied."
0,ick..... sounds like she's getting sick.,"I can see the Cyndi Lauper type appeal of her voice, but in ""At the Beginning"" what's with all the heavy breathing between bars? She sounds like she is trying to clear out some phlegm or something."
0,Not Metallica,This album sounds just like Linkin Park and Limp Bizcuit. That's beacuse they were touring with them.
0,Don't buy it,"1. It's too small for even one person.2. The filter is terrible, I have coffee grounds in my coffee cup everyday I use this.I realized all this is, is just a bottle to mix hot water and coffee together for 3 minutes, then it has it's own ""strainer"" which does nothing.Don't waste your time on these products, all you need to do is mix boiling water and coffee in a bottle for 3 minutes, then use your normal metal strainer in your kitchen to pour it in your cup, it's exactly the same thing!"
1,Enthusiastically recommended for anyone who is eager to see all the natural wonders Illinois has to offer,"Geology Underfoot in Illinois is an amazing tour of the geological diversity and wonders to be found in the great state of Illinois. Readers of all backgrounds are sure to enjoy the geologic walking or driving tours of thirty-seven Illinois sites. Maps and black-and-white photographs enhance this wonderfully enriching complement to solo or family vacations. ""The most accessible [canyon] from the Starved Rock footpath is French Canyon. One of the loveliest times to see it is in winter, when the falling streams have frozen into sparkling columns of ice. To me, these narrow rockbound defiles, with their horizontal ribbing of Paleozoic strata, define the Illinois landscape every bit as much as the prairies."" Enthusiastically recommended for anyone who is eager to see all the natural wonders Illinois has to offer, not just its flora and fauna."
0,A waste of time,"The collection of stories in this anthology are pitiful not horrific. This book opens with 90 pages of an intro that provides a chronology of ""events"" for the genre for the year. An absolute waste of paper and ink. Neither interesting nor relevant to a good horror story. Finally the book opens with the first of ""The Best New Horror"", a triffling werewolf story that left me wanting. Better stories are told by 6-year olds. But I had faith and kept reading and was further disappointed by the quality of the stories that followed. Don't waste your time, your money or your shelf space. This book is not worth any of them."
0,NOT COMPATIBLE!,"I purchased this printer a few years ago at Staples after being convinced by the sales person. The printer worked great. My family, friends and I were amazed of the quality. I was working with windows ME. Once my computer crashed, I purchased a new computer with windows ""Vista."" This is when I began to experience difficulty. It appears that this printer is not compatible with ""Vista."" The program appears to have conflicts with ""Vista."" I am considering purchasing a new printer but afraid to encounter the same problem. I will continue doing my research."
1,Very thorough coverage,This book is PACKED with information! It is also a really great size (smallish) to tuck in my travel bag and take along to be sure not to miss anything on my first trip to Samoa. :o)
0,Dead after 3 months,Giving this review now after having forgotten about this product but remembers as I go through my order history.Battery was dead after 3 months; what a waste.I gave 2-star instead of 1 because I'm not putting this (entirely) on the seller.Seller's packaging and delivery are quite good and on-time.Seller would be better off finding a reliable manufacturer for the product s/he sells.Sorry for the bad review; hope the content explains enough concisely that I don't mean you harm.
0,Low Quality Memory Foam,The quality of the memory foam of this cushion is really bad. After a week of use the cushion is sagged - I only weigh 120 pounds.
0,These slippers had beanbag-like soles in the bottom.,"The slippers are well-made, with an open slot on the bottom from which to remove beanbag-like pouches to heat in the microwave.However, my husband found it difficult to walk in them, so I contacted Tempur-Pedic [...], who cannot sell, but graciously gave me, 4 returned foam samples to insert into the bottom of the slippers; now my husband can walk comfortably. (We already own a Tempurpedic mattress, which my husband loves).I strongly suggest Carex's product development manager contact TempurPedic's product development manager in order to encourage TempurPedic to manufacture soles for these slippers. Millions of people would purchase them for under $20.00 and more jobs would be created in Lexington, KY where TempurPedic is located.Thank you."

0,Mechanical Problems,"This camera has built-in lens cover opener. After powering the camera, they should open. Soon after purchasing this camera I started to have problems with automatic lens cover opener. Sometimes they didn't close. I ignored it. Now, they just don't open at all. In a nutshell, after just one year this camera is JUNK!!! I believe that Sony's ""precision"" gear mechanism opening lens cover has faulty design. Secondly, for such basic thing as lens opener, they could have provided some ""push-up"" button to unlock it. Don't buy this camera w/o some ""protection plan"". Sony's warranty is miserly 3 months. Dust accumulation, parts friction or minute dislocation etc could kill this camera after 3 month, then what???"
0,Very disappointing,"I found the book extremely disappointing. The essays are neither personal enough to be engaging, nor deep enough to be intellectually stimulating. He talks about his personal life in such a detached and cold voice that even the pieces that had a potential of being extremely moving (like the one about his father) end up lifeless and just plain boring. I kept looking for something clever in the book, but instead the word ""pseudo-intellectual"" kept coming to my mind, as I could not find any depth to this writing.Overall, I found the tone of the book to be too whiny and lacking in wit. A waste of my money."
0,Disappointed,"It's good...except for The Bird. Having grown up in the midwest, not a rain forest, a screeching bird in the background is not something I associate with a ""good old-fashioned thunderstorm"". The screeching reminds me of tricycles that need their squeaky wheels oiled...NOT relaxing. Sigh...back to searching for an authentic thundering rainstorm CD."
1,Great paper!,"this photo paper is great!! cheap and great!Its a little thinner, but not too thin, and my printer likes it, and it takes to my canon MX892 ink (genuine and cheapo ink) perfectly, and is dry instantly.OH and it does NOT have that gross disgusting vinegar smell that the staples brand and some other papers have. It has no odor!Paper has a beautiful finish, and i am proud to plaster up my pics of my 2 baby boys all over my house with this stuff!! i will continue to buy this!Thanks!"
1,I Couldn't Put It Down,"This fast-paced political thriller is what most books of this type are not -- written by someone who actually seems to know the worlds of politics and journalism. The voices of all the characters ring true, and from the most despicable to the most alluring I enjoyed meeting all of them. The jolts in the book were true, timed right, and absent the detour to implausibility taken by so many who try their hand at thriller fiction. The frequent asides, stage whispers really, to the reader also worked -- many provoked out loud laughter. All told, I couldn't put it down and hope this is not Mr. McGrory's last foray into political thrillers."
1,beautiful!,this is a perfect picnic backpack. light enough to carry. plenty of room for food. practical but pretty.
1,Great grips,"I am a male and have a hard time playing the ds for extended periods of time without a set of grips on it. This product feels great and makes playing games alot easier for me.....the speakers are amazingly good, much better than I expected. They add a fun dimension to the games without having to put a headset on. The only problem I have encountered with this product is that it can be hard getting the games in and out with the grips on. Other than that, I highly recommend this product."
1,This book does have many Native American words,"I disagree with the previous reviewer. This book has 459 pages, and each one of them has many words in Native American languages. You'll have to see a copy for yourself, but don't take someone's word for it....there are over 2500 Native American words listed here."
0,Wheel doesn't work,"I couldn't get the middle wheel to work on this mouse, with or without the accompanying software. I'm taking it back to the store where I bought it and exchanging it for another brand. A computer mouse is too simple and inexpensive to spend a lot of time on. It's not worth any more effort to try to get this one to work. There are a lot of others on the market without having to get further frustrated with this one."
0,Not Enough Camp or Ridiculousness to Make It Worthwhile,"I saw this movie, with its premise of a serial killer gingerbread man, expecting it to be so bad it would be hilarious, but instead it's simply bad. The plot is squandered on the other characters who spend the large majority of the movie talking about nonsense. They talk and talk and talk... and in the end, there is so little gingerbread mayhem that I was left wondering why I wasted so much time on this."
1,"Great story, Fast Paced",I started reading books last year and I got hooked reading Memorial Day. Fast paced and a great plot. Mitch Rapp character goes back about four books and his stories are great. I recommend the whole Vince Flynn series and I hope he continues wiritng with Mitch Rapp in mind.
0,A disappointing choice,"I have had the AT&T; 2255 - a nearly identical model - for nearly a year, and can't recommend it. From the beginning, people complained about the quality of the outgoing message, no matter how many times I re-recorded it. Some months ago, the second handset died; recently, the battery on the main handset seems to be going. I've never figured out how to check call-waiting calls without disconnecting the first caller.In short, the phone is a disappointment in a number of ways. There are better choices out there. Pick another phone - you and your friends will be happy you did."
0,"Missing parts, made in Communist China",Arrived without end nozzle - common among reviews for this line of cans.Also - made in Communist China.
1,Great game...,"Great game and here are a few problems however:1. You die too quickly. 2 hits and BAM you're dead. ""Oh, but it's realistic!"" If I wanted realism, I wouldn't be playing video games.2. Bad aiming, sometimes it's hard to aim and when you think you should be hitting someone, you aren't.Otherwise great game."
0,WHERE is the FLAVOR ????,Rice noodles have OODLES of flavor when cooked(steamed). Absolutely no flavor at all. Indian grocery stores carry better noodles that soak in boiled water for 10 minutes. Or you can make FRESH ones if you have rice grains.
0,Absolutely worthless - I returned it!,"I was hoping that this would have original, creative, and practical ideas for things to do with my wife. Instead, almost all of the 365 ideas are unoriginal, insipid, or impractical. An example of each:Unoriginal: ""Go to a bar and play darts with your Love."" (Been there, done that.)Insipid: ""Make a plan with your Love to sneak your own snack food into a movie theater. Execute your plan."" (Gee, makes me feel like I'm in Mission Impossible.)Impractical: ""Take a shower outside with your love. Make sure to have plenty of towels and buckets of warm water."" (In my neighborhood, this would probably be followed by dinner in jail after being arrested for indecent exposure.)I must admit, however, that my wife and I enjoyed a very fun couple of hours laughing at the book's suggestions before I returned it."
1,Great phone but problems with T-Mobile.,This is a great phone but for some reason it keeps shutting off and then turning back on and says Searching. I think it might have something to do with T-Mobile. Just wanted to warn people that are checking this phone out and also have T-Mobile.
0,Experienced programmer DOWNGRADES this book,"I currently work at Symantec Corporation in Santa Monica. I have been programming in C and C++ for 5 years now, and I started learning JAVA by buying this book. I would have to say that this book is extremely NOT CONCISE and difficult to follow. I was only barely able to follow it because of my experience in C++ programming, but I'm pretty sure that if I were to read this book about a year ago, I would NOT be able to understand a thing. It is very INDIRECT to the point. If you want a good understanding of JAVA, go to the tutorial website provided by the makers themselves (Sun Microsystems)."
0,Think again,"The sound quality and pronunciation are good. But, the program locks up easily and is poorly organized. I would not recommend it."
0,Arrived Broken in a Dozen Pieces,I wanted a set of new dishes and loved the Ruby color. I was thrilled to find a serving platter that matched. It arrived in a dozen pieces so that's one for the postal service and zero for the shipping department at Amazon.
1,Love It,"Soft and silky, easy to lubricate my mechanical tools and my pipe. It's easy just pour and let it slide into you."
0,Cornwell changes his tune.,"From the December 9th issue of the (London)Economist: ""Devil's advocates were supposed to be fair-minded, and in the past Mr. Cornwell, a prolific writer on Catholic matters, has at times been anything but. As he admits, ""Hitler's Pope"" (1999), his biography of Pope Pius XII, lacked balance. ""I would now argue,"" he says, ""in the light of the debates and evidence following 'Hitler's Pope', that Pius XII had so little scope of action that it is impossible to judge the motives for his silence during the war, while Rome was under the heel of Mussolini and later occupied by the Germans."""
0,not satisfied,"Not satisfied with this product at all. I purchased it since the bottles that come with the pump are polycarbonate. These bottles do not seal properly. If you try to shake the bottle, it leaks everywhere. Even during pumping if you hold the bottle at an angle at all, it sometimes leaks. There are not enough rings at the opening for the bottles to close completely. The least the company could do is make good substitutes for their polycarbonate bottles - since it seems to me they quietly market the fact that these bottles can replace polycarbonate bottles as a ""safe"" alternative."
1,I strongly recommend it,"I like that it is based on facts. And the writers really didn't take one side more than the other. The main character (Saddam), is a magnificent actor."
0,UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES BUY THIS!,"If it was at all possible I would give this contraption a rating of ""0"" stars. It worked well the first day, and then as stated in the other reviews promplty went of the fritz. Being an engineer I took it apart to find out if I could see what was wrong. The plastic casing was indeed not waterproof! There was no rubber lining to prevent water from entering and so it promptly shorted out. Not only that, the thing refused to turn off and picked up all sorts of random radio transmission. This piece of junk should be considered illegal for how poorly it works, correction, formerly worked."
1,Good natural history for kids,This was one of the books my son loved as a boy. Not necessarily outstanding literature. But it was amazing to see the journey taken by such a fragile creature as a butterfly all the way from the US northeast to Mexico. It was a fun and painless way to introduce a small child to some of the wonders of the natural world.
0,This is Angela Gheorghiu's Worst CD So Far,"In my opinion this is Angela Gheorghiu's WORST CD so far.And considering how bad some of the previous ones were, that takes some real doing.For die-hards fans ONLY."
1,Frontlin Plus,"I've tried a variety of flea products, this one seems to make my dog itch the least. I haven't seen any fleas lately."
1,Obsolutely the best live recording of Bee Gees,"I am highly recommending this CD: great songs, very impressive vocals and great live recording."
0,Manufacturer Error,"This is a wonderful movie, one of the best made, but the DVD has some problems. This first copy I bought froze up towards the end of chapter 16. I returned this copy and received another one which happens to freeze in the exact same spot. Neither copy had any surface scratches. Has anyone else noticed this problem?"
0,"Great idea, but it doesn't work","I absolutely love the idea of this product, but as others have mentioned, it just doesn't work. Specifically, the dressing container just cannot be twisted into position. I've tried putting a little oil on the threads, but it's still too tight. A great idea, but it's just way too difficult to actually use."
1,changed my life....,"I have not had a piece of meat since watching this film. my body fat % has dropped and my energy level has increased!Thank you,"
1,Awesome.,Way better than my stupid calculus textbook by those cochran and briggs tools. It puts a hard subject in easier terms. It actually helped me a lot. Love it.
0,Not a usb headset,"I searched for usb headsets and this came up- but it is not a usb headset. It has the two plugs- one for microphone, one for earphones. The description is not clear on this. This makes it useless for some types of computers that don't have the dual jack."
0,What a mess,"Very cute front cover but when you open it up to put photos in it, the clear plastic wrinkles very easily. Most of them are already wrinkled which makes viewing photos difficult and detracts from the picture. Would definately NOT recommend"
0,This phone is terrible,"If you want to spend all day trying to figure out the manual, you have come to the right system. I'm still having a hard time looking for a 4 line phone that's easy to install and easy to use. The panasonic that we had died on us 9 months into it. And that one was fine."
1,Great golf club cleaner,I bought this tool exclusively for cleaning the heads of my golf clubs. I put in a brass bristle brush and clean the dirt out. Works great on golf shoes too.
1,A dvd write drive that works close to 100% of the time,"I say close to 100% because I have had 2 failures doing writes to the drive. Yes, it could have been the software that froze, but it might have been the firmware too. Unlike the exact same drives reviewed by a few others, it has recognized every single blank DVD I have tried. I wish I could say that for the built-in NEC DVD+R that came with my Dell. It was always very picky and finally I gave up on it. Then I bought a second internal model made by IO Magic. It reads everything quite well but doesn't write DVD-anythings nor even CD-Rs. So it was onto an external Sony drive that works ok until the firmware somehow loses connection with the computer, and then the drive no longer appears (and the disc is ruined).Additionally, the Plextor's the only one that consistently works with DVDXCOPY or DVDNEXTCOPY."
1,More Predictions Than Miss Cleo,"The section on Iraq is especially prescient. By Midnight on September 11, I already knew the Bush administration would use that horrible day as a pretext to attack those people again.Mandatory listening for anyone who cares about democracy."
0,Not even puppy proof,"I attached it as directed, and my three month old puppy complete demolished this the fist day. The metal solder holding the ring to the mounting bar is not sturdy enough even for puppy teeth. Unfortunately now i'm just left with a pointless small stainless steel bowl. Simply putting a heavy water bowl inside the carrier/cage is much simpler solution."
1,A Logophile's Lark,"First off, this is a review of the Second Edition, published in 2004, which, for whatever reason, Amazon doesn't have listed. This ""encyclopedia"" is a sort of Yank version of Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, so popular in England. It's fun to read or skim through the anecdotal etymologies provided, even if, at the end of the entry, Hendrickson admits that they're probably apocryphal. The only two criticisms I have of this 2004 edition are that there are far too many ephemeral entries from the last few years that probably won't outlive the decade and, secondly, Hendrickson is a wee bit too obviously a baseball fanatic and there is far too large a proportion of baseball-derived entries than is merited - Aside from these two small criticisms, an irresistible compilation of words, phrases and the stories (true or not) behind them."
1,Superb!,"A classic! Not only is the cinematography superb, the acting and the dramatisation of the Thomas Mann novel---wonderful."
1,It leaves the reader hungry for more!,"The book has many strange charactors. The charactors are a snake boy, vampire, half vampire, wolfman, in other words charactors kids love! This book wasn't scarey, but very interesting and I can't wait to read more in this series. My friends at school all wanted to borrow my book! I highly recommend this book."
1,One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,Great book. I hadn't read it since the 60's!So much better than the movie. It was our book club's September reading. A wide range of women from 40-75. It was all agreed upon that this book was worth reading again.
0,this cd sucks,"i dont care how this cd was made. its still the worst beast boy cd to date. im sure the next one will be even worse. the videos are also getting worse. im embaressed that these washed up white boys got the mtv best rap video award over buster rymes. the beasties stole part of busters style and songs and did a hack job of it. just like they stole other rappers styles. if they want to go off into rehab programs and find god, thats ok. but why would they make such a bad cd?"
1,Fascinating look at the weak link in war....MAN!!!,This is a fascinating and somewhat morbid humorous look at man's ability to kill himself in war......even if this means killing himself and his allies. The book reads well as a result of the author's interesting and humorous manner of writing. Sure it is not a humorous subject but sometimes one cannot help but laugh at the abject stupidity of mankind throughout history. This book proves that no matter how much technology advances there is always a weak link...mankind. Furthermore this book also proves that there shouldn't be such a fuss about blue on blue kills in the first or second Gulf Wars since this is nothing compared to the blue on blue in past conflicts.
1,5 stars,very funny show my wife and i watch it all the time . would highly recommend for a good laugh
1,finally some great prog,"Spock's Beard's first CD, ""The Light"" is one of the best examples of progresive rock I have ever heard, and anybody who doesn't think so needs to stop taking the music so seriously. If the lyrics are not a new revelation in your life, then fine, listen to some great instrumentation played by people who know what they are doing (for a change). Yes and Genesis are all well and good, but the lyrics they wrote are no more spectacular than these lyrics. Real prog fans who don't like this CD need to lighten up and stop looking for the 2nd messiah in their music."
0,Bright-Eyed and Busy-Tailed:More songs to sing and sign with kids and kritters,"This is a ""CD"", not a ""DVD"" therefore I would not recommend it!!!"
1,Brings Back the Christmas Memories - Just not for my Son,"I LOVED this album as a child, and I still love it to this day. It's well worth having as an addition to your Christmas music collection. For me, the Chipmunks carry the fun through the entire album. Please note, on this album you are dealing with the classic Chipmunk and David Seville sound rather than the modern variation (which I find a bit annoying). It's fun and entertaining, and I listen to it at least once each Christmas season. However, this year when I put the album on, my son commented that, while he liked ""The Chipmunk Song"", 16 Chipmunk songs in a row might be a bit much. It's a generational thing I guess. Highly recommended!"
1,Sleeper review I,"A very thought provoking series. Gives different avenues as to how a terrorist cell could thrive in the US and go undetected. Also, gave some insight into how individuals define his/her religious beliefs differently. Sleeper Cell is a good series and I would suggestion it to everyone."
0,This Recording Is A Total Dud,"This recording is a total dud and is to be avoided at all costs. I think this is the worst performance of Scheherazade I have ever heard. It is the worst conducted and the worst played, even worse than the many quick, budget-label runthroughs going back to the 1950's with unknown orchestras and unknown conductors. Each of the standard Scheherazade recommendations vastly exceeds this lame performance. For a good unknown recording, try the Dorati/Minneapolis Mercury recording. Just about any performance from the past is superior to this. If modern sound is a major criterion, get the Chung on DG."
0,Horrific,"This is by far, the most ridiculous attempt at a book I have ever encountered. It staggers the mind to consider that the author made any effort to write it, and on top of that, that it was actually published.The book is composed like a 5th grade book report; shallow to the point that you wonder if the author spent as much time writing it as you did reading it, immature in both content and style, and generally pointless. The concept of sexual addiction is far more profound than either Zane's unlikeable character, Zoe, or her exploration of it which never manages to rise above the sea of vulgarity and graphic descriptions of the act itself.This is the sort of book for people who believe that anyone who can read can write."
1,A Great Adventure for the Little Ones!,"Our four-year-old daughter loves Dora the Explorer, so we were delighted to see the release of Lost City Adventure. The reviews so far have been raves from the little one (and from us). The animation, music and sound are first rate, but more importantly, the challenges are appropriately measured for a pre-schooler. This program stacks up well against the Knowledge Adventure titles like Reader Rabbit. Skills such as sequencing, color matching, memory and basic addition are developed in fun and entertaining environments. Plus, there are three difficulty levels, so if your child is frustrated or bored at a certain level, you can adjust accordingly.The program works great using the Classic environment on our Macintosh G4 laptop and G3 desktop computers. Have fun!"
1,You cannot be an Acca Dacca fan and not own this album,"Back In Black is timeless rock purity. That the year is 2011 is irrelevant. I am confident that if I am still alive in 2021, this album will remain on my playlist."
0,"No, I liked it","I liked the book because it was more normal than Doreen Virtue's stuff. I read her book on angels but it was pretty way out. Like when she talks about people with spaceships attached to them and people who are cats in human bodies and calls them all kinds of angels. I don't think they are angels.I wanted somthing that would talk about angels and this book was good because it did and was clear and easy to understand. I learned to write to my angel from this one and it is very helpful to do so.If you think of angels in a normal way, you will like this book. If you want to read about angels from outer space, you will not.I think the first reviewer was pushing that other lady's book, myself.Gala"
0,The H in Harle stands for HORRIBLE,"Poor sound quality, lousy musical interpretation, and other problems make this album a horrible set of saxophone concertos. Harle almost never uses vibrato, plays outlandish cadenzas, and even skips entire phrases he doesn't want to play on some occasions. The expressiveness in his playing is almost non-existant, not to mention some technical problems, too. For example, at the end of the Glazounov concerto, instead of playing low C - middle C - altissimo C quarter notes, Harle starts on a low C and plays a *very* sloppy, uneven scale ascension to the altissimo C. His playing is generally pisspoor and his overall performance subpar. Try listening to interpretations by Eugene Rousseau, Dale Underwood, Donald Sinta, or other saxophonists. Just stay away from John Harle. FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS GOOD IN THIS WORLD, DO NOT BUY ANYTHING BY JOHN HARLE!"
0,Horrible....,"This show was a horrible piece of crap, the franchise should have died with Brandon Lee, but they keep on dredging up horrible movie sequel after sequel and this pile of crap TV show. I saw a few episodes and they all sucked. Let The Crow movie stand as a reminder of how big a star Brandon Lee would have become."
1,Raised in the Country?,"This story starts with the Civil War, a lot of blood and guts, and pain. If you can get through the first few pages it is an excellent book. It takes place in the Blue Ridge and Smokey Mountains. I soaked up the description of the land like a sponge, fog, mist, hills, valleys, green foliage, and squeaky snow. Ada the woman and Inman the man have a hard time coming together, the work is hard, surviving with no food or shelter. From Ruby- who knows how to live off the land, to Teague- the leader of the guard looking for deserters, to Pancy- the addled banjo picker, to the goat woman, the people in the story are great."
0,Lousy Headphones,"We bought these headphones with the intention of using them at the NASCAR races we attend. The firt time we tried them out we found that you could not hear anything the drivers were saying at the track. Even after adjust the volume up as high as it would go, we were still unable to hear anything. Very disappointed..."
0,Not happy with Irene Gari Anti Feather lip base,"I purchase this lip base as I have in the past, but it seemed a lot more moisturizing and it did not control the feathering. My lips felt too wet to have my lipstick not run. I would not buy this again, my lipstick looked sloppy after an hour and the color bled. Not a good look."
1,A true trek story with a theatrical reading,"Well, for those who are into star trek this story is just perfect: vulcans, myths and action. For those who are not it still is due to a fantastic 'performance' by Gates McFadden. The story itself a fantastic one with some scifi violence included comes totally to life with its talented reader. It's worth listening to this audiobook wherever time allows to. And its always worth relistening."
0,Not what I expected,"I wasn't at all impressed with this book for a few reasons. Although the pictures were beautiful and tried most desperatly to pull us into the story, we just couldn't get to the same place that the author must have been while writing the book. Maybe after reading just the first sentence: ""Sometime after summer is spent but before jack-o'-lanterns are lit, it's apple picking time."", which seems to assume that everyone is interested in celebrating Halloween.In addition to this, the book speaks twice about ""the purple ticket"" that gets punched with a half moon. I still can't figure out what that is for. There are no explanations about the meaning of this and that is frustrating because it seems important but only the writer knows why. The sad part is that he kept this detail to himself and it's annoying.We tried to enjoy this book, but at this point its end will be in our Goodwill pile."
0,Sick,"It is very disturbing that someone would make a movie like this and somehow got the money to make it. But what I find more disturbing is that people would willingly pay money to see such a film, buy the DVD or rent it. And some of this people give this film a good rating. There is something seriously wrong with the human race. If you willingly watched this film or just want to, then I don't want to know you. As for the guy who made this movie and the sequel (!) I hope karma catches up with him quickly. Sick beyond belief. There is no justification for a movie like this. No wonder so many horrible things go on in this world. Any decent human being would be repulsed by this and never even watch it."
0,Ok produce,Not 100% cellulose. Fits the mop handle. 100% cellulose if much better. Will have to look around for 100% cellulose.
1,The main review has some errors...,"""Du hast"" means you have. It's a German play on words. ""Du hast"" means you have, which sounds exactly like ""Du hasst"", meaning ""you hate"". And ""Heirate mich"" means ""Marry me"". I've just ordered the DVD. A warning though: the ""Bück dich"" live performance is very inappropriate for younger viewers! Great stuff, nonetheless."
0,The worst of Ofra Haza.,"Having bought Shaday and Kirya by miss Haza, i bought Desert Wind with the notion that it would be as fantastic as the aforementioned. Boy was i wrong. Gone are the heavy Yemenite/Israeli beats and flavor, as is Haza singing in Hebrew. Instead, I found her beautiful voice swallowed up by abhorrent 80's synth-pop cheese and benal lyrical content, with Hebrew only in the chorus at most. There is not a single song, with the exception of ""Slave Dream"" that I could bear to listen to all the way through, and most of the songs are laughably bad. So, fans of Haza's other works, do yourself a favor and save your [money] and buy Shaday or Kirya. Unless you want a good laugh, then by all means, purchase away!"
1,The Fanatic,"I enjoyed the wit, and gentle poking fun of religions (of all types) that have a way of leading mortals astray. While recognizing that dogma may hinder spiritual development, Lawson demonstrates that the fullest measure of a religious life, or any life, is in the living of life. His subtle humor is ruthlessly charming."
1,At Last-A whole CD of Josh Groban!,"My family and I have been Josh Groban fans for several years, after seeing him live with Sarah Brightman in the La Luna tour. His voice brings goosebumps to the skin! Of course, seeing him in the 1st Allie McBeal was a treat - can't wait for the 2nd visit on Dec. 10. But we have been waiting with great anticipation for an entire CD of Josh. This new CD did not disappoint, and the goosebumps were there for some time! His range is wonderful, and the breadth of songs included showcases his talent and gives a hint of even more wonderful music to come. The orchestration is full and rich on the CD, with the only wish to have the music mixed a bit under, so we can hear the most of Josh's incredible, gifted voice. We can't wait to hear the next CD, and to hear more duets with some of the well-known stronger female vocalists, for whom Josh is every bit a wonderful match. Bravo Josh, and many more to come!"
1,Amazing book,"I had to read this at University and it was terrifically entertaining. It makes you think twice about immigration. The beginning of the book is a little slow, but once you hit about page 50, it takes off and it is brilliant."
0,Not worth the money,"I've only had this thing for a few weeks, but I don't like it already. I agree with the others that the carafe is flawed. I can't pour slowly enough to keep coffee from getting all over my counter.I also don't like the fact that it's not really ""thermal"". It does shut off after the coffee is brewed, and it rapidly gets cold. The first cup is fine, but the second is always lukewarm. I don't want to have to zap my coffee in the micro because it's not hot enough for me.I'll be offering this thing up on Freecycle for someone else to have fun with and buy another one."
0,Meh,"I'm sure this was much better in the theaters and in 3D. The animation was pretty nice and the visuals were probably pretty amazing in the theater. It's just that the story was kind of dumb. I like the idea of a girl who wants to change her destiny from one of being married off to one in which she has a say and think it's empowering for young girls. However, her mom gets turned into a bear? We were sitting there going, who came up with this idea?"
0,Almost purchased until I asked what version,"I ALMOST walked out of a Best Buy with the special edition copy of this that included a little sword replica letter opener. Then I looked on the packaging to make sure it was the Extended Editions that I already own on DVD. The packaging did not say either way, even in the fine print. THERE IS NO REASON FOR THE THEATRICAL TO BE RELEASED AGAIN!! I asked a store rep and they say it was theatrical. I promptly put it back on the shelf.This is such a ripoff and insult to LOTR fans to attempt to dupe us again!! I bet they will do the same for the Hobbit!"
1,Perfume,"I own several perfumes, but everytime I wear this one I am heavily complimented. It has become my favorite perfume."
1,He went out on a high note.,"I enjoy these two discs for much of the same reasons that I prefer Billie Holiday's later music. Sure, both of their voices had lost what range they had once possessed. Yes, their voices cracked and were off key much of the time; victims of the addictions which eventually claimed both of their lives. But like Billie, Chet Baker's voice developed an emotional level which often bordered on the scary. Just listen to him on the two versions of ""My Funny Valentine"" presented here, and see if you don't find yourself wiping away a few tears. Mr. Baker's trumpet playing, however, never seemed to fall victim to his addictions. If anything, its beauty only continued to bloom. The concert presented here was recorded only 2 weeks before the artists death and features the wonderful NDR Big Band and Radio Orchestra Hanover. For the pure emotional impact of the music, I highly recommend these discs."
1,Make this video an addition to your home or school library!,"As a media specialist in Colorado, I am always in search of quality bilingual products to add to my library collection. I purchased this video and put it in our parent section after reading the glowing reviews. I can hardly keep Fiesta Friends on the shelf. Teachers have been the main patrons checking out this video. I am so thankful for a video like this that allows anyone watching to learn simple beginner Spanish phrases. I cannot wait for the second video to come out so I can add that to our expanding bilingual collection."
0,Not worth the money,"I read through this book in a few hours. I was thinking it was an ""okay"" book untill I got to the supplement section. I felt like it was a commercial. The author kept mentioning his favorite brands, which was usually one brand in particular. I wasn't surprised to see a magazine-style add in the back of the book for that brand. I have a hard time considering the recommendations credible when they are advertizing a body-building product. I also bought ""Scrawny to Brawny"" It took me over a week to read and the info is waayyyy better in my opinion!There was a good section that explained how to properly to the exercises which is the best part of the book"
0,"good drawing, poor erotica","The plot is utterly stupid. The illustrations are gorgeous, and, taken individually, very erotic. But somehow the overall effect of all of them together is just ho-hum. Manara has no sense of erotic timing: the final erotic encounter between Parva and Shiva, which could and should have been stretched sensuously over a couple of dozen pages, consists of a two-page wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am. Anyone who expects more from their erotica than just a couple of sexy pictures should look elsewhere."
0,Not what we expected,"Well if you are looking for a faith based movie - this is not one. Don't be fooled by the previews. We thought this was a PG movie... glad the kids weren't watching. There is plenty of cursing, foul language, adulterous behavior, disrespect, sinful angry parenting, typical ""when marriage gets tough just divorce"", self-centered individuals, sex, etc.... It could of been a good movie. It had talented actors, beautiful back drops, scenery, it was well filmed and crafted... but that all means nothing when you add in all the negatives I mentioned. It's just garbage and worthless- even if there is this little glimmer of hope at the end. Salmon Fishing in the Yemen not what it is proposed as in the previews. Not satisfied."
1,Still great after all this time!,My son is 16. This was shown at his school and we watched it all the way thru. Heartbreaking and exhilarating at the same time.
0,I'll never buy from cummins tools again.,"Factory reconditioned is a misnomer. This R2600 sander was a well useddog with a new cord. The sander case was abused to the point that I'mstill guessing how it got so bad. The sander was still dusty all over.I did receive two sanding pads, a new hook, and a old worn down to the nubhook pad. No PSA pad included. I took a gamble by purchasing a sanderfrom an unknown like Cummins Tools, I'm surprised Amazon allows Cumminsto be on their site. I've previously received fair service from Amazon but I'm now weary, you should be too."
1,Eco-Economy: Building an Economy for the Earth,This book is an interesting addition to the series of books written by Lester Brown; it includes updated references which are useful.
1,COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN,"The first chapter may have readers yawning, but keep going! Thirty pages in I couldn't put it down."
0,not what you would expect,"i ordered this book, anticipating it would be a humorous gift for someone who likes to take and read in the bath. the book is not a medley of sensous stories. it is a how to book, ie, how to fit two people in a bath, what oils or other items can be added to a bath to sooth and relax. also, the size of the book is a joke. it is two inches by two inces and an inch thick. overall, a very misleading title and disappointing purchase."
0,UNCLE WAS A VAMPIRE,"Like Dan O. said...this is a COLOR film because I have an old copy from TV, IN COLOR.Obviously this DVD will be in B&W; (see images), while Horror Express will be in Color.""Horror"" is now on BluRay and ""Uncle"" is on ""iOffer"" in COLOR. The print on this DVD doesn't look that great for ""Uncle""...but then, the ""iOffer""print is barely better."
1,Good and Bad,"This case fits like a glove on the Canon SD1000, the back of the case is nicely padded to protect the camera screen. Disappointed that the hole on the top of the case is too narrow to thread the camera wrist strap through. You will have to cut the hole to make it larger or have the strap come out of the case on the side."
0,Don't be fooled by the MTV.,"The video is great, the rythm is great. No doubt, ""Praise You"" is a wonderful song. It was wonderful enough to make me check out the album. However, I sold it the next day. After listening to all the songs, I discovered that the entire cd only contained four different words, one of them being the ""f word"" which, in the song ""In Heaven"" is repeated constantly for upwards of 60 times. Creativity? I see none. ""Praise You"" is a catchy song, but the album itsself is anything but catchy. Don't waste your money like I did. Instead, if you're into good pop music--check out Cher's new release or the new one by REM. If you want other better alternitives to this album that don't involve music, try beating your head on hot rocks. Better still--stab yourself in the chest repeatedly and go for a dip in your psycho neighbor's alcohol spa."
0,how about a real experiment?,"Here's an alternative idea: choose some random people, say the reviewers here, give them lot of money, houses, cars, etc., and follow them for a year. What do you think will happen to them? This would be much more interesting then looking at rich people and discussing what they should do and how. The show follows in steps of many others dealing with the same issue and the only reason for people to watch is that everyone wants to be there themselves."
1,Movie Review,A good movie starring Derek Luke and Forest Whitaker. Ernie Davis was a great college halfback in the Syracuse tradition after the great Jim Brown. Life throws curves and Ernie Davis's life was lost to a disease that caught all who knew him by surprise. It was a good movie about a little heard of African-American athlete.
0,not that good,It was a good movie but the jokes were not that good and the story was messed up. It would have been worse but Jim Carry is hilarious. His other movies are better.
0,Only Supports 3 Buttons,"We purchased this device hoping that we could program left/right mouse buttons on the bottum and Page Up/Page Down on the other two buttons to the left and right of the touchpad. Our goal was to be able to navigate PowerPoint via the additional two buttons. The device is advertised as a 4-button touchpad. However, after installing and talking to Adesso support, I discovered that the drivers only allow you to program 3 buttons. If you only need 3 buttons, this is a great device. However, because it is advertised as a 4 button device, I am giving it only two stars."
1,Buzzzzz!,"I needed this for the California Exotics remote egg vibrator I got for my little petite gf who has no really boobies, but a nice roundy round and a shaved box. The thing goes through the 6 watch batteries in about 4 to 5 hours, so you need more (and better quality) watch batteries for each night you go out and secretly control the love tunnel of your barely legal babe. What are you gonna do, run to Walgreens every time you need a little public play? I don't think so."
0,buy something else...,I bought this washing machine for my mother who lives in a small apartment. After waiting 6 weeks for delivery the 1st machine that was delivered leaked water all over the motor and had dings & dents on it. She returned it with no problems and had it replaced with the same model. The 2nd delivery arrived yesterday and this one was caved in on 2 sides. Apparently the packaging is not sturdy enough.
0,Utterly disappointing,"After reading the reviews for this book, I was anxious to start reading it right away. Unfortunately,I returned the book the same day I received it. I am in the process of starting a bookkeeping business out of my home and Mr. Lewis's book did not help at all. As I skimmed the book I quickly realized that he prefers tax accounting and a commercial office environment. If you are looking for an overview for setting up shop as a tax accountant, with employees, in an office this book will be perfect.If you want particulars on starting a home based bookkeeping business keep looking."
1,Great Off-road Instructional Book,While I'm a bit too old to ride motocross this book was absolutely fabulous in showing me the riding techniques that really took me from zero to becoming a decent rider in the woods. Now that's it's been at least 7 years since I read this I should probably dig it back out and re-read it.
1,You can cook away with this book!,"We bought this as a gift. And from what we have tasted it has come in very very handy. All the recipes are easy to follow and very descriptive. If you really don't know much about tortillas or if you are an expert, this book could give you a little helping hand. A great buy! Give it as a gift today."
1,"Good lord, this show is amazing!","If only words could describe the genious of this show, then I would write more than three sentences. But they cannot. All hail Arrested Development!!!!!!!!!"
0,Not your sturdy old Thinkpad,"I have used thinkpads for many years, and this new model is not up to the old standard. it's just another cheap Chinese laptop now that IBM has exited. The old styling cues and sturdy feel are gone. Try a VAIO."
1,Great set.,"Got this set at a very good price on Amazon. These are wonderful, sharp, heavy knives. I used the carving knife the other day to cut some marbling out of a roast, and it was SO EASY. I normally cannot stand working with raw meat. Also, had no problems thinly slicing a flank steak, and, of course, the steak knives cut through a filet like butter! Also, I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the case."
0,"Good concept, poor execution","This was a good theory to revolve a movie around (I won't spoil it here), and after the first 15 minutes and learning the plot I had high hopes. Regrettably the movie fell victim to poor dialogue, wooden performances, and odd camera work."
1,Amazing for milk ad collectors,"The Milk Mustache Book offers fun facts, behind-the-scenes photos, and we can't forget the 100+ ads themselves! Even ads printed once are included, but many of the recent ads are not included (ie: Backstreet Boys, Rebecca Romajn-Stamos, Melanie Griffith, Garfield, Mark McGuire, etc.)"
1,"A ""must"" for all Sound of Music lovers","""Forever Liesl"" is a wonderful tribute to the making of the movie. Anyone who is facinated with the film will love Ms. Carr's warm and genuine account."
1,Much better than the older versions!,"I had the version of this game before it and like it...but felt like it was lacking.And this version fixed that! It now has a board instead of a notepad, pieces, and it is easier to see the final goal and see how you are doing.It is a really fun game to play with friends and family. Even if they aren't music buffs they will enjoy it!My favorite thing is that you can repeat cards in different games unlike so many games that are over once you have done all the cards. It works multiple times because you never know what songs you will think of!Overall it is a great game!"
1,beautiful purse,i bought a knockoff style of this purse in june and by august it was tattered. so i bought the real thing. this purse is my favorite ever. it is so roomy holds everything i need. the interior doesnt tear and it looks wonderful. its so comfy to hold and is all around the best handbag you could wear.
1,You Fool,"ok, here i go on my first review. it may not really have anything to do with the album, but i am angry, disappinted and upset to see that one reviewer has misspelt the name odf track one. ""YOU FOOL"" the song is ""whole lotta love"", not as you incorrectly said ""whole lot of love"""
1,The Pick of Destiny,"After all the hype, and after loving the first album, I thought I'd give the film a go. It isn't too bad, I was expecting more belly laughs than I got, but it is a genuinely amusing film that will kill a few hours on a Sunday afternoon. A few moments do make you chuckle out loud and there are some great cameos. Jack Black is his usual gurning, swearing, hilarious self and KG comes out with some great lines as well. Don't expect too much, but do expect a great film that doesn't take itself too seriously and that will raise a smile.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
1,Fireproof,"The DVD ""Fireproof"" was quite new and untouched. It has increased my confidence in Amazon market."
0,Not so smelly scratch and sniff,"I purchased this book for my daughter for Christmas. When it first arrived we enjoyed the story along with the scratch and sniff stickers that did initially release a scent. Within 4 weeks of first opening this book, most of the stickers had lost their scents. I must add that it had only been read about 5 times during this month. I noticed from the reviews that this has been a problem for many purchasers. The story is cute, but without the scratch and sniff portion, you may as well get a different Christmas book. I wrote a letter to the publisher to complain and never got a response. I would not recommend buying this edition."
0,Peppermint Creek Inn,"I thought the description sounded like a good read. In all fairness, the beginning of the book gives a warning as to what the content might include, but of course, you don't get that until you get the book. I got this when it was free and before most of the reviews were written or I probably would have passed.That being said, I think the story would have been a decent mystery without all the extremely graphic sex. The first part of the book described what they wanted to do to each other and the second part they did it. So much that quite a few times I felt like I was reading porn. I'm not a prude but I kept wondering if all the descriptions were really necessary to tell the story.I found myself skipping some of it just to get to who the bad guys were. The whole amnesia and bad cops story without the graphic sex would have made this a good book."
0,Handle fell off,The handle broke within days of getting this radio. I can still use the radio but only with batteries but what is the point of a windup radio with no handle.
1,"Good, but not as good as the first one","While most of these animated music videos are top quality and a real treat for the eyes and ears, they were still of lesser quality than the first video collection.Pipe Dream, the favorite of the original Animusic, is merely rehashed here as Pipe Dream 2. The Pogo Sticks (my personal favorites from the first video) make a welcome return, with some glow in the dark friends. The weakest entries were Resonant Chamber (a creepy and out-of-place guitar/wooden spider fusion), Cathedral Pictures (I don't like religious music or themes), and Gyro Drums. The rest are decent, particular Fiber Bundles. The intricate and perfectly timed light bundles glow with ethereal beauty."
0,Big Mess,My credit card was charged $97.89 on Feb 3. No book ever arrived. I can't believe that the correct price is that high for one single book.Please advise.
1,the perfect holiday gift,"What a wonderful book! Crisp and full of flavor, like the first bite of a fall apple. Beautifully written with tons of information, yet very approachable--I can't wait to cook my way through it. I'm a big fan of all the Page/Dornenburg books, and this one is the best yet! I'm giving it to all my friends for Christmas."
1,Awesome,"Awesome show, Love it!, I don't know what to watch after it's done :/ ..It's like a movie in every episode."
0,Victim of Illusion.......,You're better off playing this on your PC and liten to the sound and forget the video because there is only one camara angle. The sound is decent which is the only decent part of this set.
1,One of The Best Xmas cd of all Time!!!!!!!,"(...) Martina Mcbride does have one of the most distinctive voices in Country and Pop music.This Christmas cd IMOP is a tie with Amy Grants Xmas album,as the bset Holiday album ever.I love the way Martina did not put new Christmas songs on this.Instead she went with the classics.Which are better written than anything anyone has come up with lately.So if you want a Christmas cd that is well produced,well sung then get Martina's White Christmas.You wont be sorry."
1,Brings me back to Ukraine every time,"I lived in Ukraine for two years, and every time I read this book it brings me back to a wonderful era in my life. Besides that, this is a hilarious and heart-wrenching debut. I've lost count how many times I've read it, but it doesn't matter: It's just as good every time.Great stuff."
0,I'm a Greg Iles fan but....,"Jeepers, this was a hard book to stick with. It is not that there was not plenty of action. Iles never disappoints in that area. It just did not make a lot of sense and the characters were not believable. I have read all of Iles early works, then sort of got away from him. This book did not encourage me to find any others."
0,made my stomach upset,A talented band fulfilling a record company contract album quota by rehashing 20-25+ year old material. Hang it up dudes and retire. Nothing new or even worth listening to here.
1,The shadow of His wings,This is a biographical passionating story. I had never imagined so many adventures in one person's life. Twice condemned to death and twice liberated. It gives you back the real purpose of life. I strongly recommend it.
1,If Jack Kerouac Were a Baseball Man...,"...ok, he was, but still. Kevin Kaduk ""drops out"" of the working world (a lackluster sports reporting gig in Kansas City) and moves to Lake View (aka ""Wrigleyville""), a Chicago neighborhood, with no ambitions other than attending Cubs games for a season. It's sort of like ""On the Road,"" in terms of its loose style. It's meandering. The sentences are short. So what. I dug it.The cover promises baseball, booze, and broads...and there's plenty of the first two (baseball and booze) but not enough broads. Kaduk watches the ladies. He stares at the ladies. And, once or twice, he talks to a lady. OK. But he doesn't provide enough vivid details: What are they wearing? What aren't they wearing? What color is their hair? What size are their racks? For a book written by a twentysomething male for twentysomething males, ""Wrigleyworld,"" like the 2005 Chicago Cubs, ultimately falls short of immortality."

0,faded,It was in good condition when it got here but I've had it for a couple of months now and the sun is causing it to fade. The lettering now looks like it has been through the wash a few too many times.
0,Buy something else.,"Easy to use, but useless and a waste of money (for two!!!) because they never send the results. I can't recommend this to anyone."
0,DO NOT BUY,"The product I received is NOTHING like the one advertised! It isn't the same color, shape or style, and I SINCERELY doubt it is the same brand as advertised. What I received is a very cheap, unflattering, too tight piece of junk. It looks NOTHING like the images. It shapes your breasts into very strange cone-shapes with a ridiculous seam right to the 'point'. It's so uncomfortable (the cut and the material are awful). BE CAREFUL IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THIS ITEM."
1,Gene Kelly-I love his white socks!!!!,"He was the ultimate entertainer....His dancer body was in shape before it was hip to be toned!! His dance was a very acrobotic one...he was intense and gorgeous!!! He was also beautiful to look at....And I loved his white socks!!!!! So, if you are into the Gene Kelly movies....so am I!!!! He began with ""For Me And My Gal""...in 1942 with Judy Garland...."
1,Pac's best album,"You could feel his anger on almost all his songs. And that's what makes, it so raw, originial and, overall, REAL!! He was the realest artist I ever heard. Just listen to his interviews. There will never be another Pac, RIP."
1,EXCELLENT BIBLE FOR KIDS,"I GOT THIS FOR MY NEPHEW, WHO UNTIL NOW THE ONLY BIBLE STORIES HE HAD WERE CHRISTIANS EVENTHOUGH WE ARE CATHOLIC!

1,Groove N Go Music Maker,"I got this toy for my 18 month granddaughter. It is much bigger than I thought it would be and so much fun! The sounds are different from most toys - human sounds rather than computer generated. So much fun that even my 16 year old daughter loved it! With each turn of one of the rings you get a different type of sound (boing, or a child laughing etc.)You combine those to make music and fun. I am VERY happy with this toy."
1,An A For Style,"While it's true that this book had little to do with the sinking of the Titanic and the main character, Sumner Jordan, is far from a plausible twelve-year-old character, the style transcends all of that. Bass has a very eloquent way of writing and could set a good example for young and aspiring writers.If you want to check out the book because you are a Titanic buff, keep on searching, but if you are interested in a real writing talent, by all means, try it out."
0,"Wrong Item, It is not 150 ft. roll, It is 5 pieces of tape!","I bought this and had to send back, they sent same item, It is not 150' roll, It has costed me time and money, and I'm sure it has costed Amazon or Midway time and money, Trying to help everyone, Have told them to take it off the site,because it is Misleading!"
1,Bocephus Boogie,"Rockin' Randall is out of control! ""Hog Wild"" is a MUST HAVE for any Hank fan! And reviewer David Quantick - What's your point?"
0,Great product but DON'T BUY IT HERE,Verifying the other reviewer's story...I also had a CHI that was purchased on amazon.com. It broke about 3 months after I got it and I was told my warranty was VOID because Amazon is not an authorized dealer. NOT WORTH THE HASSLE!
1,Great book on a crucial topic for all real estate investors!,"There are some really great tips in here on negotiating (something that's not intuitive for me) specifically pertaining to foreclosures. But not only that, they have some concrete strategies in there about how to actually find the deals and structure them to be profitable. Above all, they structure things in such a way that everyone wins. Getting this book should be a no brainer for anyone that wants to invest in foreclosed properties!"
0,hey this is fake swing,"this band has a horrible orchestra. It is like some lame rock and roll, not swing at all.Weak songs with lame lyrics. I tell all you swing cats out there take my advice stay away from this band. It is boring and not danceable. It is trying to change the music and boy it...."
1,A Must-Read for any Theme Park Fan,"This book is a fascinating read for any Theme Park enthusiast. Buzz Price was there crunching numbers for Walt when Disneyland was first developed and built, and then went on to work with the creaters of Sea World, Universal, Six Flags, Busch, and many other parks the world over. If you enjoy the history of the parks, or any of the intricacies of how a park is run or planned and built, you will enjoy this book. Most inspirational is the explanation of his overal philosphy to be a ""yes, if"" person and not a ""no, because"" person. I found it fascinating!"
1,Pretty good season,I've always been a Sunny fan but notice that this past season wasn't as great as I had hoped. I think they peaked with Kitten Mittens... Still love the show though and will keep watching no matter what!
0,Disappointing again,"Russell Watson's first album is a disappointment. However, listeners would expect a better attempt for the 2nd album. Unfortunately, Watson has disappointed again. In fact, his singing her is worse than in his debut album, which is both strange and maddening. If the debut album is worth 2 stars, this new one can only get 1."

I've left multiple messages with manufacturer. I began the process Dec. 27th & today is Jan. 5th without a single word from seller or manufacturer.

1,Seemed like it worked.,"I tried this when I felt one of my headaches coming on. I woke up feeling miserable and stuffy, along with the headache. Before long, I was sneezing too. I took the first dose at about 7 am, then another dose at around 11. My headache was gone by noon and I was no longer stuffy. I took another two doses that day, but didn't have any more symptoms, so I decided to save them and see if I get the same results next time I feel bad.I'm not sure if I was getting a cold or had allergies, but the product did seem to help. When I have these headaches, they usually last a full day, sometimes two and I have to take OTC migraine medicine to make them go away."

1,In the Mind of PTSD,"As always, Tim O'Brien's writing style is amazing, surprising. His structure is enjoyable to read, and re-read. I'll likely read this book again within the next few years just for the great description and prose.However, as much as I enjoyed the style, it took me a few chapters to get into the story. Had I not previously read a couple of O'Brien's other books, I might not have granted it as much time as I did. Luckily, I did give the book a chance because as soon as the story picked up, I was into it.O'Brien's veteran experiences provide a wonderful backbone for his characters and John Wade (the protagonists) is interesting and real. As an Iraq War veteran, I found a number of traits in the character that I could understand, and a couple I could relate too. At times I was surprised but the plot and I enjoyed where the winding trail led me.In the Lake of the Woods is a good book and I'd recommend it to anybody wanting to understand the inner working of a PTSD mind."
1,"S'Wonderful, S'Marvelous, S'Luscious","So smooth, so mellow, these incredibly romantic songs will warm your heart, put you in a sentimental mood, and make you think of the one you love...Diana Krall's smoky voice and terrific interpretations, her jazz piano, and the incredible musicians that back her are all superb. There are also beautiful, lush strings arranged and conducted by Claus Ogerman and played either by the London Symphony Orchesta or a L.A. session orchestra (a.k.a. the best musicians in town).The songs ! What a great and incredibly tasteful collection of classics...a delight to hear the Julie London hit ""Cry Me a River"" again...always adored ""Love Letters""...my favorite Burt Bacharach song, ""The Look of Love""...the delectable ""Besame Mucho"", and on and on...every track a pleasure to hear.Each song is taken at a slightly slower tempo than is perhaps usually heard...the better to dream by ! This is truly the most relaxing CD I've ever heard.Total playing time is 50:36."
1,Great tracks!!!,I've owned this CD for many years and pulled it back out a few weeks ago. It is a great CD!!

0,Break very easily,"I agree with all the other reviewers who note how fragile these glasses are.We received these as a wedding present less than a year and a half ago. We really liked the size and feel of the glasses, but over that short period of time all but two of the glasses have broken. Only one broke in a fall--all the rest have shattered with minor bumps or have simply come out of the dishwasher with cracks in them!As much as I like everything else we own by Anchor Hocking, I cannot recommend these glasses."
1,Beasts of the Southern Wild,Incredibly honest and fresh view of the world present through the eyes of a child living in the wilds of Louisiana.
0,Does not sing at all!!,"We received this as a gift ordered from Amazon for our son. It does not sing at all. Dots light up on Barney's mid-section, and an annoying sound repeats itsself. I have been going round in circles on this site to try and return it, but they seller (which is not Amazon.com) has not sent the required documentation with the package. Clearly a poor quality product, and possibly a deliberate effort to make sure you can't return it once you realize what you have received."
0,How does this thing work???,"I have had mine for a couple of weeks now and still haven't figured out how to work it. The instruction manual is not very helpful. It doesn't even tell you how to go about getting mail and accessing the internet othere than saying you need ""third party software"" to do so. Well what else would one use a modem for? Shouldn't the software be included or at least suggestions of which to use? I downloaded Eudora Suite (free) and just can't figure this out. It should not be this difficult for an average person to use. I will continue to work with it but if I can't get it up and running soon I will return it. So far it's been a waste of money. I amn very disappointed."

0,garbage but.........,"I think this album is trash, I think Ice needs to quit while he has a little dignity left....maybe go back to the surreal life......but. Someone on here was ripping on all whit e rappers calling this ""a sin"" and ""filth"" and that hes the ""biggest joke in the industry.. Now, not defending Mr. Van Winkle, but how is it filth for him to do this but not EVERY OTHER RAPPER IN THE GAME???, Also, as far as ""white"" rappers, Eminem has talent, and when this ass came out he did too (for his time period). Also, he's not the biggest joke in the game. That title would be a tie.... Jay Z (because he got ripped apart by Camron.. Camron for christs sake!!!!) and of course, who could forget the talentless Benzino.. Benzino is the biggest joke ever.. I could rap circles around him, and I hate hip hop"
0,DISAPOINTED IN SELLER,"The movies are great! I ordered them so I could watch them on my laptop while I'm recovering from back surgery. Not knowing I got HD DVD's that do not play on my laptop, X-box or any DVD player. I contacted the seller via e-mail, and got no response. Now I'm stuck with these great movies I can't watch."
0,Would give it 0 stars if I could,"I'm very disappointed at this fridge. Almost a week within the time that the one year warranty expired, the fridge side stopped cooling. Had to spend hundreds of dollars for a repairman. He repaired it, and the same thing happened 2 months later. That repair company was out of business, but luckily I watched him and learned how to fix it. This has repeated over the past year and a half where every 3 months or so, the fridge stops cooling on the fridge side. Well, today the freezer side stopped cooling. I am very upset since I lost a lot of food, and will lose a lot of time getting it repaired or replaced. Oh, also, the water filter bursted and spat out black stuff in the water for over a year. LG said there was nothing they could do. Never buying LG anything again. This fridge is the epitome of a cheaply made appliance.Don't buy this, unless you want to buy mine. I'll start the bidding at $1. Any takers?"
1,Great software to learn Russinan,I have tried several Russian Language CDs to learn russian and they were all difficult. This software gives you the basics if you want to learn Russina before you travel. There is also a second level of this software that bulds on the Talk now software. I would recomend using this with any other Russian language training material you have or may want to use.
1,gotta speak up here,"I was looking up my former AP Biology teacher Mr. McGraime, and found this book on amazon which he wrote. I just wanted to assure readers that Mr. McGraime is NOT sexist as some readers believe him to be and that he is a brilliant teacher with an extensive background in biology and physiology. Don't take my word for it. Just do a google search on ""raymond mcgraime half hollow"" and you'll find a couple of the many students he's mentored to become westinghouse and intel international science and engineering fair finalists over the years. I just had to speak up because he's by far one of the best teachers I've ever had, and although his book may sound sexist at times, he is assuredly not sexist."
1,Great way to get protein after gastric bypass surgery,"Mochacinno is absolutely the best tasting protein powder for me. Since gastric bypass surgery I have to take in lots of protein, & this works great & tastes great too. Who could ask for more?"
1,The Queen Serves Up Substance and Style,"Queen Latifah has had a stellar few years, and she caps it off with an exceptional album that will have the world looking at her in a whole new light. A departure from the rap and hip hop we are used to from this artist, ""The Dana Owens Album"" is a surprisingly fresh collection of old standards done in a jazzy style that Miss Owens pulls off with grace and power. The vocal interpretations on this album are simply dazzling. In an age of cookie cutter pop stars and redundant hip hop artists, it is a relief to see an artist go out on a limb and give us something of substance and style."
1,it's the best,My faimly has 1 of the sim city's it's just great and also fun for everyone Ihope you go and try to play one of the sim city'sthey are great
1,A good book if you're already a fan...,"Deveraux essentially wrote one book when she wrote ""Twin of Ice"" and ""Twin of Fire,"" but split it into two packages. It's the story of twins and their searches for love. You MUST read ""Twin of Ice"" first, as it sets up the story fully. The majority of ""Twin of Fire"" is to remind the reader of what happened in the first book, then giving the same events from the other twin's perspective. It's classic Deveraux, and a fan will like these (particularly ""Twin of Ice"", the better book). Be sure to read ""Twin of Ice"" first, and read ""Twin of Fire"" directly following. I didn't really like the ""playing catch up"" style of this book, but it was interesting to see the same events from many sides without muddying up the stories. If you're not already a fan, don't start with this one: read ""Sweet Liar"" or ""A Knight in Shining Armor,"" my personal favorites (and I've read all but two now). ""Twin of Fire"" was not her best, but it was a nice book to cuddle up with on the couch."

0,Sick,Don't watch this show with your family. Very sick subject matter. Looks like the L's deleted my last comment on here. Warning people that this show is sick is wrong now. WoW.
0,Don't waste the money,"Good intent, poor execution. I bought this dvd ONLY because I LOVE Gary Dourdan. It could have been better, but it's an independent film, so I give it an A for effort. The overall acting is shaky at best. More care is taken to film the sex scene itself, than any other part of the movie. If the same attention to detail and lighting had been taken throughout the film, I would have given it a much better rating."
1,Sealed the deal,The movie sealed the deal for me to be a fan of Angelina Jolie. She was excellent in this movie. It's a tough movie to watch because of the subject matter but you get hooked by the acting. Because of this movie I watchedChangelingalso starting Angelina Jolie.
1,Good read!,I'm not into Sci Fi but thought I would try this book based on the other reviews. I actually enjoyed it and would like to read book 2 & 3 by the author.

1,I like this CD. Barenaked Ladies Rock!,"I like this CD! I've been a fan of Barenaked Ladies for a while, and have a lot of their music. I hope they continue to make music. THEY ROCK!"
0,Really a Band this great leave alone,These guys did the music better than anyone could come along and ever do. To do a tribute album is nice but production time and effort put into the originals puts anyone behind the eight ball from word go. You have to really work hard to ever update these songs if it is even possible. Never understood these types of albums. I mean the original did them right why remake them.
1,Don't Be Scared by the Bigwigs,"Some of the bad reviews for this book are scarey to read if you are a mom trying to help your child. They say it goes against scientific evidence and they use a lot of big words to make their case. My advice is to buy the book and try the Davis method for yourself. It worked for my 8 year old daughter and it is not cumbersome or complicated. After just the first ""Orientation"" session she went from reading one paragraph with 20 mistakes, to reading the same paragraph with NO mistakes. I've also called the helpline at the back of the book whenever I got stuck implementing the program and they were always happy to give advice. If you are wading in a scientific sea of information on how to help your dyslexic child, this is one method you should not be afraid to try. It just might by the thing that works for you. Wouldn't you trade all the ""scientific evidence"" in the world for just one book that might help your child to read?"
1,Get it.,"I couldn't put this book down. Chock full of snippet quotes from the Punk/Rock/Glam world. Great for those of us w/ short attention spans. There's great stuff & some horrible stuff, too, but, like driving by an accident, you just gotta look."
0,Brutal book,The book is horrible. This guy was a one hit wonder and now he's trying to exploit it with a boring and long-winded book.Save your money!
0,"If you want to do well on the MCAT, DO NOT buy this book!","This book is a complete waste of time and money. The review section is way too general, and the four ""model"" examinations are both too easy and do not accurately reflect the actual content of the real exam. For example in the biological sciences sections, there were no organic chemistry questions at all, but instead an overwhelming majority of questions about human physiology. Anyone planning to take the MCAT would be better served by buying A) the released MCAT tests available from the AAMC and B) a better review book like Kaplan."
0,Title is misleading.,"I guess you can't expect too much for the price, but this isn't an in depth history of Gandhi. It actually provides very little information about the complexity of Gandhi's personality. This is more of a short essay written in praise of Gandhi and no analytical understanding of the man."
0,I found this book predictable and frought with errors.,"This book reads like a high-school journal. I have to say that after encountering the twelfth typographical error, I began searching for the publisher's address in a frustrated attempt to write back to them, informing them that their proofers were all on vacation when the print files were released. I wound up putting it on the shelf unfinished, and I plan to include it in my next yard sale. The plot was predictable and I found the characters to be shallow. I read a lot of fiction, but I was embarrassed to tell my friends about this one. I don't expect to read any more of this author's work, but I would advise her to find another publisher, one who can actually provide editing services."
1,Allen does it again,"Robbie Allen does it again. This book is a must buy, (and no I don't know him nor have I ever met him.) But, I'm a professional instructor/consultant and have been at it for over 14 years and his materials keep on making me look real good to my clients and customers.Robbie, keep up the good work - to all of the rest of you, just buy the book and you'll realize how good it is. (I won't bother with the technical reasons....others have already enumerated the reasons this book is technically fully-baked.)Now, if you could just write on MOM 2005 and SMS 2003 like you do with Server 2003, Active Directory and Exchange...... :)Mark Myers"
1,"nice size, good price!","I got this bag after I realised that the Compudaypack was great, but I won't really be lugging around my notebook half the time.The Micro Trekker is a nice size, it holds my Digital Rebel XTi with my 100mm macro and another lens, my accessories and my wallet and keys. The construction is solid and reliable. And the pockets are very functional. And my favourite - a nice touch - is the little clip for keys, so I don't have to go fishing for my keys.Love it."
0,NO PICTURES,"I was looking for creativity. The cover looks great and appears to have great ideas but there is NOT ONE PICTURE in this book! She does have alot of ideas for additives and examples of how much fragrance to add, or color or clay or other oils. I would say this book is more for beginners. If you are looking for new ideas then forget it. NO pictures??"
0,I am a Christian and I don't hate children...,"Nonetheless, I cannot stand this song. Whoever wrote that critics of this song must not be Christian, must hate children, blah, blah, blah...well, they must not have ever seen what happens to a young child whose parent dies. I can tell you from personal experience that childhood grief is anything but beautiful. My own sister died quite young, leaving 3 kids under 10 behind. As a result, I don't understand how anyone can call this damn song ""beautiful"". I get sick to my stomach whenever I hear it."
0,Out-of-date blender,This is a noisy blender with a jar base that is difficult to engage properly. The cost is reasonable and so are the results. Wear ear plugs or buy a better machine.
0,NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Missy dont go and forget who helped get you on top of the game, what was you thinking the (COOKBOOK) WHAT THE F**K was you talking about, you must have been in a fast food place to come up with something like that, you must have a lot of guts to be big and still come out with a CD like that. I like your style but.......DAMN!PS.It's time to step your game up."
1,special jars,I chose this jelly jar because I wanted something special for my holiday marmalade. This are delightful. I tried to get another case and they sent me Kerr jars instead. Disappointing.
1,Ryan's return review,I really enjoyed this book. The author knows how to draw you in. Your attention stays with every page. I did not want the story to end.
0,NON EFFECTIVE,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS SCAR CREAM. IT DOES NOT HELP AT ALL. I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT AND DO NOT SEE ANY DIFFERENCE. I HAD TO STOP USING BECAUSE MY SCARS WERE ACTUALLY GETTING RED AND NOT GETTING BETTER AT ALL. IT IS A WASTE OF YOUR MONEY. I HAD TO SEARCH FOR A DIFFERENT CREAM TO HELP MY SCARS HEAL PROPERLY.IT IS VERY EXPENSIVE TOO.
1,Can't deny the quality of it.,"After all, it is Canon, it is sharp cut; however, if you want to use this with some lenses. Just make sure that it will not create shadow and dark angles in the frame."
0,NOT FOR BEGINNERS!!,"As a language instructor of English and French(MA in TESOL) I found this book to be problematic. There are not enough listening and vocabulary activities on the c.d. As a total novice in Polish I need a lot more chances to hear the pronunciation. Each chapter gives you a very brief dialogue and doesn't even review the pronunciations of the lists of new phrases and words from the book. Then, in the chapter review they include new words and phrases not yet introduced!! Hello? How can you review something not yet introduced? My fiancee is Polish and I will be going to live and work there next year. If anyone can recommend a decent polish workbook with grammar for beginners I would really love to hear about it!"
0,Wait a second and take a breath!,"There should be a clear distinction between the real teachings of a certain religion and the actual behaviour of its followers. Muslims are also human and not one of them can claim that he is without a sin. It is no secret that Muslims can make mistakes in appliying and understanding their religion. The same is true in Christianity as was demonstrated by the Pope when he apologised for the evils commited by the Church throughout the ages. Thus to criticise Islam as being flawed and to base such criticisim on the behaviour of some of its adherents is to commit a grave mistake. In order to form an accurate picture of a certain religion, one should examine its teachings carefully and not base his conclusions on what is publicised in the media. I advise Warraq and some of the reviewers to wait a second, take a breath, and reexamine the issue in an enlightened fashion."
0,Reliability issue,"I received the flash card about two weeks ago. I used it in my canon XSI, which worked as expected initially. After taking about 500 photos, I decided to copy the picture over to my desktop.I'm not sure what happened, but when I tried to copy the photos to my computer, the files were not readable. I could only retrieved 20 pictures out of the 500 photos I took. I brought this from ChiTek, hopefully they'll exchange for a new one.Anyhow, relability is questionable for this flash card. I never had a flash card broke on me before."
1,As suspenseful as it gets; unbearable tension,"I have read a few books by Mr. King. I got into him after _The Shining_ was released, however, and read mostly the newer stuff. But if you only read one book by SK, make it this one. A book that demands to be read from the opening chapter, _The Shining_ will have you checking behind doors and shower curtains. No wonder this story has been made into a movie and a mini series"
1,ANOTHER GREAT ONE FROM RANCID!,"LIFE WON'T WAIT is another great album from RANCID! After their classic OUT COME THE WOLVES, Rancid hit the world with this great punk record with echoes from ska, reggae and classic rock. The truth is that RANCID is the greatest blend of RAMONES and THE CLASH the world will ever seem. The way Tim and Lars sings is so cool, the bass player is a phenomenom and the drums rocks...RANCID is the kind of punk that really satisfies my soul,"
0,blew up in my face,"I purchased this unit a number of years ago on the basis of the oil filtration system and the ability to keep it clean in the dishwasher. I used it four or five times and was very pleased with the ability to drain the oil and keep the used oil in the fridge. About the fifth or sixth time I used it, it started making a loud bubbling noise, and when I opened the top, oil exploded all over the kitchen and my face. (fortunately I wear glasses and wasn't badly burned.) I think I called T-Fal and didn't get any satisfaction. I subsequently saw a recall notice for a JC Penney fryer that looked identical, but TFal continued to deny any knowledge of such a problem. At some point I tried using it again (on the porch), and it wouldn't go over 300 degrees, so maybe I just had a bad unit. I might try another one."
0,Guess work!,"I really wanted to enjoy this book. That being said, I found the authors traveling around the world and speculating on old fables to be quite annoying. The author does very little to back up his speculations with any documentation or fact. Maybe I'm old school, but I can do without guess work. Give me some fact."
0,BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,"Horrible adaptation. I hadn't read the comic since I was a child, and went into this not remembering much, and I STILL hated it. Rights issues aside, why weren't there any other superheroes at Superman's funeral? Why did the producers think it would be a better selling point to dump all the original voice actors and get ""stars""? Why did they use cliche and throw in Lex Luthor as a villain? After I suffered this tripe, I read the first 3 issues of ""Death of Superman"" and I was even more sickened.ALL the pathos, depth and meaning from just the first issue was complete void in this animated garbage.MISSING was: Superman on a talk show defending his fighting for good to a hippy teenager while Doomsday was beating the Justice League to a pulp, Doomsday crushing a bird in his hand, blood dripping down as he laughs, etc etc)Shame SHAME on Bruce Timm and all others involved."
1,Finally!,"It is about time that studios started looking into their back catalogues and releasing some old gems especially animated ones. This is a surreal reality cartoon from the genius Ralph Bakshi, a blighted but brightly lit urban landscape filled with far out characters. NOT FOR KIDS Now if we could get them to release all of Bakshi's workWizards- Fritz the Cat- Fritz the Cat 2- Streetfight- Lord of the Rings- I would especially love to see the short lived but spectacular Mighty Mouse series he did put on dvd! Even todays animated laugh fests on tv don't compare to this mans work."
1,The Way of the West,This movie is slow moving but the performances from the actors are all standouts. The storyline is easy to follw..those who enjoy Westerns will like this one.
0,AVOID!!!,I purchased this prior to Xmas and finally got around to installing it (so I can no longer return it). It worked for the first 5 minutes and then died. Look elsewhere.
0,Poor Customer Service,The software hangs up when trying to scan a file. Repeated attempts to get help from tech support resulted only in a string of emails that asked me the same questions over and over.
1,Excellent - faith and action,"Mostly I bought this for my wife, who loves it.It has some irreverence, some cool twists, and a good ending.Fun to watch."
1,a little different,"ok here is the deal, the music is very similar to the first one, the vocals and melodies have gotten a lot more poppy and memorable, but in my opinion this is not a bad thing.......i think most of the bad reviews are because they have gotten a little more poppy, but overall i think it is a good second full length"
0,THe worst Serger - ever!,"Bought this Singer Serger NEW, from the Viking/USEW center in Joann's January 2008. I have 30 Years sewing experience and am a ASG member.This machine has been horrendous. I gave it a try, thought it was a good price, it was on sale, and with the present economy was hoping it would be a good buy. Save Your MONEY and BUY A Better BRAND! You are going to want to pay the few extra dollars and go with something better. After numerous trips to MANY Joanne stores, this has been used once!For a first timer you will be so frustrated , it will turn you off Sergers!I am trading it in for a Huskavarna or Babylok"
0,More Dictionary than Phrasebook--not useful,"I usually don't bother to review things unless they are an outlier to my expectations, which this book was. I'm actually in Vietnam now, and I have not cracked this thing once. Of the 250 pages in the book, the only phrasebook part of it was pp 13-27. The rest of it is a dictionary with a menu reader at the end. Not recommended unless you are looking for a dictionary."
1,You leave me wanting.....,"I enjoyed ""Satisfy My Soul"" tremendously. However, the ending left me feeling a little like I had just fallen off a cliff. It seemed a bit abrupt, after the slow, methodical depictions of the characters and the intricate relationships developed throughout the book. I guess I've grown accustomed to the ""they lived happily ever after"" (in this life) kind of ending.Looking forward to your next novel. Stay well.Genuinely,PinaP.S. Loved your article in Essence. So true, so true."
1,A film that makes want to say hmmm,"Now, at this point, I am in agreement with some of you who say that this film has been offensive at times. I also feel that once you get into it, you see a true beauty. I'm kinda of out with the jury here, but I will say that I liked the ending because Lester was at peace with himself and what happened. I liked it. Now, the wife, she lived in another zone completely. The daughter as well,(her and that boy were compatible), and her friend was just I'm so beautiful. Now, forgive me, but I am still unsure who did him in (My bet is the wife).All I can say is what a film!"
0,Didn't last long,We used this slow cooker to cook up probably four or five batches of chili over the last year or so....Plugged it in the other day and nothing....Dead......Buy something else. This one is not worth the money.
0,unreadable,"Let me say first of all that I loved ""The Corrections"" which is why I was eager to read another offering from the same writer. But this book does nothing right. Every character is unlikable. The plot (or one of the many plot lines) involves the ""evil corporation"" cliche that dominates so many books and quickly became tiresome. And I can't imagine that this book ever got past an editor. Some of the prose was so poorly written I was literally laughing out loud. I rarely stop reading a book once I've started but with only 40 pages left of this 500 page novel, I gave up. I had no interest in the story or any of the characters and just couldn't stand to read another page.What a waste or real talent."
0,Not such a great textbook.,"I used this book as a textbook in a class. I feel that it is not really that strong of a book for most introductory polymer courses. I feel that either Alcock's book for a course stressing systhesis and characterization or Heimetz's book for courses stressing polymer physics are better. Of all the polymer books on my shelf, it is probably the least useful to me now. It is at the right level for begining students, but there are better choices for beginners out there."
0,A Romance for the Anti-Feminist,"I love vampire romances, however this entire series horrifies, and at times, sickens me. I wouldn't give it any stars except that it's required in the form.If the idea of ""justified"" rape and women born to belong to men is sexy to you, then this book, and the series, is for you. The men are all thinly disguised Neanderthals and the women are obedient doormats. Sure, they protest a bit at first, but soon they're all happy to belong to their men and do what they're told.I truly believe that people should be allowed to write and publish whatever they wish in our society, even if I personally disagree with it. However, the fact that young women are reading this and finding it sexy is truly disturbing. I fear for the future generation if they consider *this* to be the way men should treat women.Don't waste your money on this series. There are many other authors out there who write vampire romances without the need to make women subservient."
1,love it,My little one absolutely loves this nursery DVD we have to watch it everyday . Terrific buy for your little one and a bit of down time for you
0,Simply bad! you'll learn nothing..,This was a waste of money. I got this DVD for $28 and learned nothing. It's pretty much a scam.. You'd learn by going to a club one time more that what this DVD would ever teach you.I feel they made this DVD in one hour.. seriously!!
0,Very disapointment,Never recived the product - got a knock off / wrong product in a used apple bag. I tryed to send it back and they claim they have not recived it for the trouble I wish I went to the store
0,Such a disappointment.,I cannot remember ever being so angry at an author for jerking me around as I was with Jodi Picoult when I got to the end of this book. I was willing to ignore the ridiculous coincidences (such as Julia and Campbell both working on this case--are there only a dozen people in this town?--and Jesse's crimes affecting both Brian and the judge) and overly affected writing because the plot was so engaging. But Picoult's idiotic and gratuitous surprise ending is unforgivable. I can't believe I wasted a day reading this book only to be jerked around at the end.
1,Fair and balanced,"Biased supporters of either the Israeli or Arab leaderships will undoubtedly take issue with Jimmy Carter's take on the situation in the Middle East. My view is that he provides a fair and balanced view of historical developments in the area and the problems that need to be resolved. Like in any relationship it comes down to respect and trust, not an easy thing to achieve between two parties with such a history of hatred and suspicion. Still, in spite of the obvious difficulties Carter remains an unwavering optimist, a man of faith."
0,"Lame, derivative, puerile, and misogynistic","I tried to like this as a student asked me to read it, but I kept feeling like I've read this story before. Characters in the book do stupid, unbelievable things, and I ceased to care if they were killed; in fact, I sort of looked forward to it with a few of them. Names of characters seemed derivative, and I could not stand Kahlan. Her name seems like an amalgam of floor wax product names, and she is not a very strong character. I'm not surprised that the book did well however; remember the rule: ""People are stupid."" Maybe this refers to the people who bought this book?"
0,"if you like deep, sustained screaming, this album's for you","you really must have testosterone flowing in your veins, instead of blood, to appreciate this album fully. the relentless heavy, deep sustained screaming does not let up on this album, song after song. i look to ""Metallica: ...And Justice For All"" or ""Metallica: Master of Puppets"" for my testosterone release. yet norma jean is for those who, my guess is, use the above mentioned metallica albums as a way to chill out. this album is off the deep end for me, but i recognize that there are people out there who like this type of... music. i'm not one of them."
0,Great DVD player for about 2 months,I bought one of these for my father after seeing how great my roommate's was but after 2-3 months both of them started flickering and would freeze up from time to time and now my fathers only plays about half the DVDs he owns and my roommates can't get through 20 minutes of a movie without flickering then locking up. I found out from talking to people on the internet that about half of these units have MAJOR hardware issues. Buyer Beware.
0,NO USB CABLE,"I do not recommend that anyone purchase this printer. I did not get a USB cable with the printer so I called and was told they could not send me a USB cable that they had to send another printer. I was assured that they would check the contents to be sure it was included. I got the next printer again without the USB cable (the printer is useless without the cable to hook it up to the computer). Since I do not want to be shipping back multiple printers I gave up trying to get a USB cable sent to me. I had to go to Best Buy to purchase a USB cable to use this printer and it cost me $35.00, guess this is why they are missing from the boxes."
1,Randall Flagg in the old days.....,"My favorite King villian Randall Flag aka The Dark Man aka The Walkin' Dude is one of the main characters of this great read by King. The story is aimed at a younger audience, and my elementary school students love it. This is a kinder, softer, King that doesn't get gory on us here. The story is an enjoyable fantasy and fun to read."
0,This product is a disaster,"I purchased this item 2 weeks ago and have had problems with the lid since day one..It is so tight I inevitably have a mess while taking out the basket and other parts of the coffeemaker. This morning I struggled with the lid again, and it ended up burning my arm and hand as the basket flew out and coffee grounds stained my robe and ended up all over my counter and floor..I have two blisters as a result and a burned arm. I have tried to email Farberware but for some reason the address [...] is not a valid??? address..I'm now afraid to use it..I thought maybe with use the lid would loosen up eventually but I'm not going to take the chance of this happening again.."
0,Sending Back,"The unit worked for about a week, then stoped after running for about an hour each time we restarted it. Cleaned pads and bought new ones,(hard to find) and the problem still exisited.We are mailing it back and hope for a refund?????Don't buy this one."
1,Not bad,"This is a not bad dictionary. It has a very nice list of countries with their capital cities, as well as Chinese provinces and frequently used measure words in the end. Unfortunately it is only one-way (English-Chinese) and is lacking in a lot of specific vocabulary like names of basic vegetables, etc. The layout is clear and various meanings of a word are translated according to context, with examples."
1,Out of the ordinary Highsmith,"The creepy universes that flow from Highsmith's imagination are usually based in the everyday lives of ordinary people, and so it is with ""People Who Knock on the Door."" A small-town family is shattered when some members are born-again; there is a sense of danger and alienation not unlike ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers."" Every age seems ripe for a parable about the self-righteous and the damage they do -- so this 1983 novel is compelling no matter when you read it."
0,Not durable,"Silicon became damaged in less than a year, from only moderate use. Otherwise it is a nice size and shape."
0,Parts missing !,"Wiper part was missing , wiper was wiggly and moves with high wind. I would not recommend these to anyone !!"
0,a bit disipointing,this movie was ok but it had way to much cursing and it was not funny.this movie is not sutible for young chirlden.the only reason i am giving this movie two stars enstead of one is because it had tom hanks.if marlon wanes would of been left out this movie it would be a preaty good film.
0,Breaks Easily,"I bought this item a month ago because I needed some of my watches' bracelets shortened. Immediately when I got it, I tried it out and thought it was a pretty good product. After using it on a second watch bracelet, the needle (the part used to push out bracelet springs) broke off. It's a good thing I purchased a back up spring bar. If you want this product, then go ahead and purchase it because it's cheap, but be ready when it breaks. I suggest you order at least two to save on shipping."
0,This series is excellent,"I've watched this series on video from my local library, and it is a top notch documentary exploring the many phases of American Cinema. I wish I'd had access to a series like this when I was taking a university course in film way back in the late 70's.However, the price that these companies are asking for this series (from $225 to $1800 dollars) is totally bogus and ridiculous.A DVD costs less than a dollar, and you're asking for these absurd prices! A fair price would be maybe 50 dollars, but $1800?I hope that nobody is actually paying these prices from these sellers."
1,Great!!!,"This is excellent. It is scalable and simple. We like it a lot. 2 things to note...it is held together loosely by wooden dowels. There are no screws. I don't think that this will be a problem, though. And also, the wood is not finished. It is beautiful wood, though."
1,No problems,"I'm not sure what self centering means. Yes there is a nickel sized, two nickel thick protrusion on the face, but you still have to place the velcro pad in the right spot. There is so much velcro that it will hold in any spot. There is no 'self' centering.Anyway, the part feels very high quality and the velcro is very secure."
1,Fantastic ring!,I bought this ring to give to my boyfriend and when it came in the mail I feel in love with it so much that if he doesn't like it I am totally keeping it for myself! The ring seems to be true to size. The fact that it rotates makes it really cool and the way the whole ring is made seems pretty well done. I would definitely recommend this ring!
0,Disappointing,"Only good thing about this book is the intensity of the dialogue and the rich portrayal of characters, but this doesn't hold up till the second half of the book; the rest is cliche arguments that could in no way have come from the actual people involved in the setting. Pamuk really starts making characters say the things that are more stereotypical than actual, real, or even relevant to the discussion being portrayed. I agree with lots of the reviews here. The book does confuse and annoy. I left this book twice and read others then came back to it, each time with the hope I could see it with a fresh eye, until in the end I dropped it at the last quarter, too tired of the continuous dragging on and on which I assumed would only continue to the end, leaving me unsatisfied.May God bless my mother's soul, but it really would have helped if she'd taught me a thing or two about Turkish. I'd much rather read the original Turkish because maybe, just maybe, the problem is in the translation?"
0,Question,i have a new Macbook Pro and unfortunately my cat scratched the outside of it on the silver portion and it looks quite unsightly. Will this work? I've only seen reviews for using it on the screen of iPods and such...
1,Must Have,"This album is amazing and I can't stop listening to it. I first found out about them by some link referring to them in the lines of Siouxsie....and well, anything related to Siouxsie I will probably like. I saw their video for ""The 1234"" and loved their sound. First two albums were OK....then this one came out and floored me. I got to see them live for the first time last night in NYC and was even more stunned with their sound live....and Aimee is a extremely engaging peformer. Check them out."
0,The description of the book was a lie,"I ordered this book because it was suppose to be in new condition.When I received the book it had writing in it,(I hate books with writing in it) the back of the book is very sticky from stickers being removed, and the book clearly says used so she tried to cover up the fact that she already purchased the book used so she removed the stickers,but, it was stamped on the pages.I was stuck with the book because my class had started so I had to settle with it. I will never order from this person again."
1,Great!,"I am using these with my Zoom Q3 HD Audio / Video recorder, and battery life has improved dramatically as compared to Duracell AA batteries:Standard AAs: ca. 4:20 h of audio recording (AAC 320 kb/s)Eneloop: ca. 6:30 h of audio recording (AAC 320 kb/s)Almost sounds too good to be true but that's what I am experiencing - and testing is simple: I recorded with a fresh set of batteries / fully charged Eneloops, by the time the recorder shut down and saved the file I had a good approximation of the battery life => the length of the audio file the Zoom saved before it shut down. :-)I'm glad I bought these, great design, works as described (charging takes several hrs for a full cycle - I do it overnight) and it saves me tons of money on batteries."
0,"The only thing ""HAUNTING"" me is the money I wasted","a decent scare or two during the first 45 minutes, but I can that from my own driving."
0,Not the same quality,The sweatshirts I received all had obvious flaws that were noticeable right from the package. Also I have purchased this same brand and style from other web sites and the XL fit me. All three of these were to big.They appear to not be the same quality
1,Very Pleased,I ordered these for the family so they could have a familiar taste from home. They were so excited. This product was fresh so I was very pleased.
1,READ THIS BOOK. YOU'LL LOVE IT!,"I thought this book was a great read. Not only was the book educational, it was also a very entertaining read. I dont think I have ever read such an entertaining non-fiction book in my life. The book realy tells it how it is. It lets you know the facts about how crooked our justice system is, and how powerful our government is. I would like to say ""Thank you"" to Mr. Klaber for writing such an enlightening book. I would now, after reading this book, rate Klaber up there with the other great writers of our time. This book is a must read, five star acomplishment, and possibly one of the best books I have ever read."
1,Bass Maximizer is exactly wat it does and more!,"this product does exactly wat it says it will do... Maximize ur bass!!! u will be amazed how this lil thing can make any good system sound great. there are some important things to kno before making a decision on adding this to ur setup: make sure u have a good supply of power to run the system u might have to add extra batts, have a good component setup powered by a amp, if u decide to go with this make sure u have a authorized dealer install this product it is very easy to fry ur entire setup with this if not connected properly or adjusted correctly. before i purchased this i saw reviews were people said this isnt for rap music and there rite and wrong at this same time. new rap music its not really for but if u like old school rap music like i do then this is the perfect addition to ur setup ull feel like ur there in the studio with the artist."
0,earrings,The earrings are smaller than I imagined. I would have liked them a little bit bigger. It is hard to tell that I have them on.
1,Soul R&B,"The Marvelettes are the one of the best 'girl groups' of this era. With two lead singers in Gladys Horton and Wanda Young, the Marvelettes cranked out some great dance numbers and cool ballads. Their style is a mix of pop, soul, gospel, blues,jazz and a dash of funk. Some of the best songs written by Smokey Robinson were recorded by these ladies. It's no secret the Marvelettes were one of the main catalists in putting Motown on the National Music scene. With 12 top 40 tunes to their credit and some great misses and excellent B-sides, this collection is one of the best featuring the Marvelettes and the Detroit sound."
0,Great preformance but sound quality is poor,This DVD deserves five stars for preformance but for technical quality I would give it one star. I don't know how Sony could stamp the Dolby Digital logo on this disk when it sounds as bad as it does. When I play it on my Onkyo DS-595 I get no center channel output and the bass is terrible. I have the SRV box set and it contains a DVD with songs from the same 1989 concert and it sounds like Dolby Digital should.
1,great book,This is an excellent book. It's easy to read and has a lot to say about relationships. Should be required reading for both men and women.
1,Quick light read,"This was the first book I have read by Jennifer Crusie, and I am very impressed. I will definitely be seeking out more of her works.I read the book in lightening speed because I was so caught up in the story. The humour added to the pleasure, and I just kept picturing Fred jumping through the window which in itself to me was comical (for those of you who have read it you will definitely know why).All the characters were likeable especially Nina. I did keep picturing Alex as this young frat boy type, but he was so good to Nina that his age became a non-issue. It is good to see an older woman attracting a younger man for a change rather than vice versa.Very good reading! You will definitely be pleased."
1,Love the Toy,"My granddaughter is 6 years old. When she first played the game she was so busy watching her cards, she forgot about the spoons. I believe this game will be very beneficial in teaching her to focus on more than one thing at a time. It is an older game, brought back with colorful spoons big enough for any child to enjoy. I would definitely recommend this game for family fun night."
1,Great book for those interested in West Point,"A very good book for those interested in attending the United States Military Academy. Provides very straight forward information about what is required, what it is like being a cadet both good and bad. A perfect book to give to either the parent of or the interested student."
0,eh?,The only thing that was really fun in this game was killing Orcs or whatever but the game definetely wasnt as bad as some say. Seems this one was aimed more to a young audience. The movie wasnt very good either so I guess they go together.
1,Great musical,"The musical is great. Captivating music, even if Leonard Bernstein left the live production midway and said something to the accord of ""This isn't music, it's a laundry list!"" The cd was fine. I don't know what to review as far as technical things abou the product."
0,Love Miso Soup but not this,"I didn't find much in the way of the tofu bits that make many brands of miso soup interesting (yes I know they don't all contain that) and very little seaweed.. it was just this super dark murky watery stuff. Mine tasted strongly like smoke and a weird chemical taste. Bleh. We poured it out. To be fair I picked it up at a local supermarket, not here and it was not cheap."
1,excellent book,"This book is well worth reading more than once.Few, if any, of us were raised or taught how to be mindful in any relationship, let alone an adult relationship. I highly recommend that you give yourself the gift of reading this book and implementing its teachings into your life - with yourself and with others."
0,Strong vinyl smell and pilling,"I registered for and received this item at my baby shower thinking that I had found a great product to protect the crib mattress. When I took the pad out of its bag, I realized that there was a strong vinyl smell to it but figured that it would go away after I washed it, but I was wrong. Not only did it still smell, it also started to pill. I'm surprised that no one else noticed this!"
1,i love it,i love it was good but something was missing but i had an extra peace so it was allright thank u thou came quick
0,Horribly cheap,Horribly cheap fell apart after 6 months my last pair I bought lasted 4 years of world traveling it sucked
0,Very Disappointed,"I ordered this pole for my pool because it was the lowest in cost I could find. They tend to be expensive. When I received it in the mail, it was packaged in paper wrap. Paper wrap, really? The metal on it was all dinged and dented and looked terrible. I returned it, and amazon refunded me the pole cost, but not the $20.00 shipping I had to pay to send it back. All in all, I had nothing and paid $20.00 for it!"
0,poor value - over priced,I think they priced a single plate at a set of 4 plates price.Know what you are getting before you order.
0,This grinder is awful!,I am very disappointed! I had a Krups for twenty two years and loved it! I have had the Capresso for two months and hate it with a passion! Uneven grind to say the very least! Anything more than a half hopper of beans for aFrench press and the motor smells and smokes.....I would never buy a Capresso again!!!
1,A surprising delight,"I had moderate expectations when we rented this but decided to give it a try. Both my wife and I were pulled right into Jeff's crazy world and were delighted by the skillful blending of comedy and pathos. Very well written and directed, and perfectly cast. Devoid of cliche's or formulas. Entertaining and satisfying, start to finish."
1,Gluten Free Pantry Angel Food Cake Mix GREAT product,"I disagree with the person who gave this product only one star. I did find that I had to beat the cake longer than the box indicated and needed to bake it longer. I mixed my first one using my portable hand mixer which was really too small for this product. Second time I used my new stand mixer with the whip attachment. It more than doubled in volume after beating it about 10 minutes longer than the package suggested and I beat it on high. The cake filled my tube pan to the top and I baked it about 5 minutes longer than package suggested as my first one was a bit underbaked. My husband, who is NOT celiac, loves this cake also. We can't tell the difference between this one and a regular angel food cake mix. I also used 1 teaspoon of GF vanilla and 1 teaspoon of GF almond extract instead of using 2 of vanilla. I like the almond flavoring in angel food cake better, but that is personal preference."
0,Complete junk,"This pseudo heavy ""walk"" through Oregon with a serial killer story spliced in between windbags spouting about their being healed etc.... is surely one of the worst pieces of junk I ever tried to read. This book takes itself way too seriously and the writing is amateur. Total garbage."
0,Kind of sticky but no stains,Pros-*super easy to use*lets you reach difficult spots on your own since you don't have to reach to rub it in*very fast to apply*it seems to last a long time based on how you can feel the residue on your body (though I would still reapply per directions to be on the safe side)Cons-*sticky rather than smooth like a lotion*doesn't always come out right (should be a mist but sometimes a stream comes out)*supposed to be no rub but sometimes it comes on unevenly and you have to rub it in*bad smell*have to be sure and close your mouth because it tastes terrible if any gets in there*my son hates having it sprayed on (I think because it is cold)[update- he doesn't seem to mind it anymore}*bottle gets very slippery miduse*sometimes it stops working as you are applying it (the control gets stuck?)*takes a bit of force to get it to work (at least my bottle was like that)I don't plan to buy it again. I'll use what we have left but that's it. Great idea though.
1,Great Laces,"These laces are great, it saves me time during my transition from bike to run. Well worth the money."
1,Locked Room Classic,"Carter Dickson (also known as John Dickson Carr) created another wonderful golden age locked room mystery in his novel, The Judas Window. Sir Henry Marrivale is the sleuth and he is, as always, a dependable joy. The author has surrounded him with an able cast of supporting characters to help nudge the story along. The triumph, of course, and the reason for this book's existence is the locked room crime. Carter Dickson knows how to tease the mystery and drama out of this glorious cliche, making it seem fresh and new. This is a classic from a thrilling time in mystery writing by a true master of the form. Not to be missed."
0,"Too much endless guitar soloing, this isn't the Allmans","When Frank Marino sticks to songs and uses guitar soloing to improve their quality, like everthing from World Anthem to Full Circle, you get Robin Trower, Rory Gallagher etc at their best.When he uses a song as an excuse for endless guitar soloing, as in much of this recording, you get redundancy. Unlike the Allman Brothers, this is not quality jamming between band members.By the way, why does Amazon include a 'NO' in 'was this review helpful to you?'. People are only human and don't like opinions that differ from themselves. With some who are less mature, this the 'NO' makes it too easy express such displeasure.Are they trying to discourage negative reviews, hence not purchase the CD. Such reviews only help a person in not being dissatisfied a product that received positive reviews"
0,waiting waiting waiting...,"this book had all the right ingredients except action. NOTHING HAPPENED! There were half hints and glimpsed promises of what could be, but it held back giving me any manisfestation of these. Thank goodness the sequel ""A Man rides through"" came through with the goods. That was excellent. The first book just set the scene. Which for a 658 page book is a big introduction chapter. I suggest you read the blurb of the first, (and the fantastic first paragraph) and jump straight to the second book if you want to see something happen."
0,More is less,"About Face is largely a rant about examples of ineffective user interface design, with regular breaks along the way to expound upon some ""golden rules"" of user interface design. There's plenty here that's worthwile -- such as as hisarguments against the notions of ""metephor is good"" and ""modal is bad"" -- but it is spoilt by his poor writing style. Whereas Edward Tufte can concisely illuminate just the important elements, Cooper will labour for page after page over trivial points and then insist on trying to summate more complex interactions and subtle distinctions with clunky and trite generalisations. The examples and analogies are regularly unconvincing and sometime completely incorrect, such as when he tries to tell us the telephone was invented for business use. At nearly 600 pages, it's delivery ironicly echos one of its central points about user interfaces: more is less"
1,Amazing book!,"The book is very informative and helps with healing, but it is a little hard to read. I would recommend this book though for anyone that is going through the loss of a child."
1,No problems,I used these tires to fix our heavy duty stroller. My wife takes it out every day without problems. The tires are holding up well at -15F.
1,Kindle large print helps people with vision problems,"I purchased the Kindle generation 2 for my 91 year old mother who has macular degeneration. Our library has a large selection of large print books, but many aren't current. The Kindle has solved this problem. She easily learned how to operate it without any other computer background.We can download current best sellers and the Chicago Tribune which she misses since moving from Illinois. The Kindle has given her many more books to read and adjusting the print is the best part."
1,No issues.,Got it on time and was exactly what I expected. Worked perfectly with my machine without issue. Thw size was sufficent enough to fit my father's arm which was too big for the contour cuff I got with my machine.
0,not what i expected?,it says light drabber but they don't tell you it has a blue acsent? yes it turn your hair a tint of blue.
0,STORY GOOD. ILLUSTRATIONS BAD.,"The story is a classic.But the illustrations are abominable.They are all done in the perspective of someonestanding in the shade. Why?The very first picture is of three tall trees. But at thebottom right corner are three mushrooms.THIS IS NOT OK.TIM JONKE is also the illustrator of""Little Rose of Sharon.""Based on his work here, I would avoid that book as well.More to the point, I wish people would be more considerateof the Ten Commandments. I wish they wouldconsider what IDOLATRY is, and how the Bibledefines it."
0,not safe!,"Do not buy this mattress, it is not safe. This mattress does not fit either of the cribs we have for our twins. When I called Kolcraft to inform them, the CS rep was rude and insistent that this mattress was standard size and would fit, and that they haven't had any complaints. She also implied it was my crib that was the wrong size. We have 2 cribs and the sealy matress in the crib the twins still share fits nice and snug. The Kolcraft has at least an inch gap and can move around quite easily."
0,Doesn't Work Well With Vista,"I've had both Final Draft 5 & 6, but just bought a brand new laptop, so I figured I should probably upgrade. Bad idea...Long story short, I ended up uninstalling it and sending it back. For some reason, 6 works better.Oh, and forget about using Collabowriter on 7. I was told by their own tech people this is never going to work because of new security features built into the new operating systems."
1,Held up to a beating,"I was very happy when this hat arrived because it fit my husband's very large head. (We bought the X-large) This is a major problem finding him a hat. The first day he took it to the farm he came back and it looked like the dog had gotten hold of it. I asked what had happened and he said he got into some yellow jackets on the tractor and the hat had come in handy to bat at them, Although it is tattered, he is still wearing it and it is serving the purpose so it is very well made. You might say it is a multi purpose hat."
1,"Great music, but...","...this CD is *way* out of date! While it has a few EXCELLENT songs, keep in mind that Spirit's catalogue consists of basically four albums, all of which are budget priced. If you're in the mood for a hits collection, Time Circle's a much better buy.So hah!"
1,Buy this for all of your Pregnant Girlfriends,I absolutely loved this book while I was pregnant & have reread it with each pregnancy. I also have bought it for everyone I know who is pregnant. It is the most straightforward book & tells you things doctors forget!
0,Sometimes you can't trust the reviews.,"I'm sure this was nice 15 years ago, but now it is so outdated it looks comical. Or maybe it's just me."
1,fascinating story about the mysterious tradition of Geisha,"I first learned about this book from listening to Arthur Golden's interview on National Public Radios' ""Fresh Air"". A story about a Geisha written in first person by a western MAN sounded intriguing. A most difficult feat, but Golden manages to pull it off. In the interview, Golden described how he completed the research for this book and why his earlier attempt at writing in another voice besides first person failed. The details Golden adds when describing the rituals and training of young Sayuri, the Geisha-to-be is what I enjoyed most about this book. The Geisha tradition is very foreign to me as an American who has never traveled to the far east, and has limited exposure to Asian culture, firsthand. The story of Sayuri's life is very sad, but the reader is rooting for this strong willed woman to survive and overcome the tragedies of her early life. I think this book is destined to be a classic like Pearl Buck's ""The Good Earth."""
0,BLU-RAY review,"The Stargate Blu-Ray does not look good at all. I would only buy this on Blu-Ray if you do not own it on any other version, as it is only $10."
1,Marvelous musical canvas!,"I must confess that every time I decide to read a biography of the Great Painters of the past, I use to harmonize it with this enraptured music. The serenity emanated and the astonishing equilibrium of the form is simply unequaled.Frescobaldi was organist for excellence and exerted that office in San Pedro, Roma between 1604 until his death in 1643 with a brief period as organist in Florence between 1628 and 1634.His Canzoni constitute perhaps, the most refined evidence of his creative talent. Admirable from all standpoint. Fortunately for us, in the second half of the century XX there was a sudden interest about his musical legacy, that allowed to many ensembles as this fabulous and relatively recent (1979), or Andrew Parrot soloists have made possible the rediscover of such appreciated and many times forgotten gems of this Period.Perfect tonal balance and aristocrat musicality characterize this excellent ensemble. Go for this CD without dilation."
0,Hamish??,"When I started reading this book, I was aghast at how similar--nearly identical it is to the Hamish Macbeth series by MC Beaton, which I adore. And that's the problem.I spent the entire time reading this book comparing it--unfavorably--to the HM series. I saw that the Evan Evans series began in December of 1998, while the Macbeth series began publishing in Feb of 1999, so it's not as though MC Beaton saw this book and feverishly began working on copying it.MC Beaton's Macbeth series is just more humorous, the characters have more depth to them.This book was ok. Probably won't continue on in the series."
0,Ency OHS 4th ed,Disappointed compared to 3rd Edition in terms of organization and searchability. unwieldy. wish I had kept previous edition.
1,The Absolute Best!,"I'm not sure why this is not readily available in stores but it is the best! It has a better, smoother texture, better flavor and even a richer color than the Hershey and Nestle cocoa available in stores. If I ever make something using a different brand of cocoa I feel like I'm giving inferior quality food to my family and friends. It is worth ordering!"
1,For those who are interested in the paranormal,"The Vampire chronicles are my favorite Anne Rice books and this book adds much to what has been written. She weaves history and facts with her fictional story so that the lines blur. One of the best books I've read this year. I'm a fan of the paranormal/supernatural in fiction and this is one of the best offerings right now. I also recommend in a somewhat similar yet very different vein, Robert Doherty's Area 51 series-- current paranormal in a complex and alarming story of things that border on the supernatural in 1998 America. His writing isn't as elegant as Rice's but the story is fast-paced and intriguing."
0,Form over Substance,"While Parton is incapable of recording a truly bad album (well, there was 1987's RAINBOW), this is a major letdown after the understated elegance of her recent folk/bluegrass work. The production is as over-the-top glitzy as her outfit on the cover, and the song selection is baffling. Rather than including the war-mongering ""Ballad of the Green Beret"", she would have been better off with Woody Guthrie's ""This Land is Your Land"" and ""Pastures of Plenty"", which would have been equally patriotic, but would also have been more in keeping with her last three albums. Instead, what she ended up with was an album that sounds like it's designed as a soundtrack for the next Republican convention."
0,A Poor Imitation,"Ms. Dusi may have been a talented businesswoman in Australia and she may have been in a dire need of an income while living her dream in Tuscany, but she is not a writer and I did not need another half-read bore on my bookshelf. A senseless rambling. In fact, the only intriguing thing about this book is its title and this is what lead me to click the 'buy' tab. This book cannot compare to the expat classics, such as A Year in Provence and/or Under the Tuscan Sun. Have no idea what all the gushing reviews are about."
0,so-so,my experience wasn't good with this one. I tried to make dvd copies but all failed...no success. However it good to burn data files on to it.
0,disappointing,"This is our book group selection this month and I was looking forward to a good read, especially judging by the appealing cover. Ms. Benita is indeed a great story teller and visual with her discriptions,however,the character developmentis sorely lacking. Perhaps this is the point, but why? All sorts of trying events, happy occassions and other significant life experiences occur but they had little impact as I did not really know nor care about many of the chacacters, although I wanted to. Jacinta in particular needed some enchancement. It will be interesting too hear what my fellow book club members think."
0,"Low Price, Low Performance","Like most Sony low end products, you get what you pay for. The price for the item is fair. But, don't expect much. Analog tuning and just ""ok"" sound.I have upgraded to the ICF CD2000, lists for around $189.00 It is portable and has great sound. This is the second model in the series. Stay away from the older portable model. I was told by sales people that there were lots of returns. Sorry do not have that model number."
0,Don't Bother,"This is another example of Hollywood predicability. The movie is so transparent that within the first 15 minutes 90% of the world's population has the killer figured out. What a waste of a good actor (Eastwood). My advice is don't bother watching, renting and especially buying this movie."
1,Excellent mainstay food,"This is solid fare, especially for smaller fish. Cheaper than Spectrum flakes, I believe it's actually superior. Of course Tetra Marine Flakes should be supplemented at least occasionally with krill or an appropriate equivalent source of protein (pellet food such as Spectrum Thera +A is a good choice) and seaweed or Tetra Veggie for those fish that need greater vegetable intake."
1,"King of the ""WILD"" Frontier","Chris Crutcher's King of the Mild Frontier is an autoiobiography that is fresh and funny, but also teaches his readers about life experiences and teaches people to make the right decisions. Crutcher's humorous story about his life brings you through his memories and gets you to see what it is like to be in his shoes.It starts as funny, through the middle it gets hilarious, and goes down a slope from humor to astonishing heart pounding memories. From his strange family to his wakcy image, to his wannabe sports dreams, Crutcher brings you through a story of his life, that is heart filled and makes readers turn page after page. Pages of happiness, laughter, and drama that will inspire you to read more of Chris Crutcher's stories."
1,One Dope LP,"I just gotta say, these boys really ripped the spot up with this hot LP. This new one is blazin'. If you ain't got it yet, go to the store and grab it off the shelf now. Underground is where it's all about baby, it's where the true MC's are. mad talented cats in the underground scene. pick this up!"
0,Amateurish,"This low budget video is not worthy of distribution by Amazon. It's an amateur video that looks like it was made by a group of New Age ""researchers"" who made it for themselves, and for sale at New Age and crop circle conventions. It is not a comprehensive or balanced inquiry into the phenomenon of crop circles, and even assumes a certain level of prior knowledge. The ultimate premise of the video is that crop circles are created by a ""cosmic"" connection between people thinking about shapes, the mysterious lights associated with crop circles, and the crop circles themselves.The Discovery Channel it ain't."
0,Wish I saved my $,"I bought this toy for my daughter before she was born, and she never really got that into it. It really seemed to eat batteries too. My daughter would roll herself off of the ""boat"" because she was so bored with it. She did like grabbing for the fish when she started to reach for things. I guess that's why I gave it a couple stars."
0,product is worthless,"I order this to help support to help with my back, however it compresses into almost nothing when it is in use resulting in no support. Will be returning it as soon as I get a chance"
0,Go clipless,"It works as a timer and, after timing out, it resets itself. That means that I can time 20 minutes and then it resets to 20 minutes so I can repeat.Anyway, I don't like it. The magnet is mounted to the back of the clip resulting in poor balance. When it is stuck to the fridge and I poke buttons the thing often spins upside down or falls to the floor.I'm replacing it with one having no clip."
1,The one book needed when travelling to the galapagos,"I just recently returned from the Galapagos Islands, and the book that guided me throughout my journey was this book by M.H. Jackson. Very easy to find the animal you are looking, and also helps to discover more creatures to look for. Helped explain things further from what the guides had said. Also helped me in answering many people's questions about different creatures. A Great book! A must for all travelers to the galapagos in search of unique wildlife."
1,very good replacement,Works well with Polar F11 watch. Big improvement over the solid plastic transmitter that comes with the watch. The battery can be replaced on this model which is a big improvement in design.
0,Excellent book,"One of the best books for first course in topology. There issome weakness in the second part, but for the first course of topology this book is great."
0,Leaky,"When I first bought this oil pan/container, I thought it was pretty neat, because it has a screen and a large twist cap that allows the container to be stood up after changing the oil. Well, after three oil changes, I have thrown it out. The small twist-off cap cracked and broke, and the large twist-off cap leaks when stood up. If buying this pan/container, only use as a drain pan - not for storage or transport. I would recommend a regular drain pan with a large opening, as this one's opening is quite small. I made a mess when I used it, as the position needed to be adjusted - and forget about trying to line up this pan with the oil filter."
1,Jangle Up....,This is without a doubt the best CD I have purchased so far this year. If this is an indication of what the scene in the south has to offer I'm tossing the guitar in the back and heading down today. There isn't a bad song on this album.
1,This Book Stayed with Me,"This was my fourth or fifth Danielle Steel book to read and I think I loved this book much more than the rest. This story grabbed me and wouldn't let go. It stayed in my mind for 3 days straight after I first read it. The characters and their love story was the most heartbreaking thing I have ever read. He was married to an unloving wife which made him miserable and she was a young girl who didn't know what love was...until they met. I give this book 5 stars because it kept me interested and wanting more when I finsihed it. It isn't one of Danielle Steel's longer books, but it has a very compacted and dramatic story. When you start the book, it is told from the point of view of a character who is not named, but she is the pivitol beginning and ending of this story. It is the middle of the book that focuses on the two main characters who make up the love story."
1,A teriffic book...,"This is a terrific book which speaks to all the important issues faced by parents who want to help their kids within all the athletic programs available today. I was clueless when my kids started playing sports, and I learned a lot from Wolff's book. When I was young, Little League was nearly all you had to think about, and the decisions were easy."
1,Full of Information and comes from a unique perspective.,"Length:: 4:19 MinsWell this was my first book in Middle East LGBT and it really opened me up to the field of study I want to do. I was disappointed with the sources, but I understood that he was writing about something that there are only a handful of academic sources on and a few other stories by independent authors, so I gave him credit. I wish it could have had more reliable sources. Some of the internet ones no longer work. But it is a field in which you have to slide into under the cover of something else.. I know this since LGBT Middle East is my master's degree.. Besides the sources.. this is a real informative book, full of information. I learned some things I had never even thought about, dealing with the Middle East culture. I recommend it for all in the ME area and LGBTQ/Gender studies."
1,Great Pants,"I have ordered this type of pants from many different companys'. But this one did not dissappoint, with shipping, pricing, quality of product, and customer service. All in all I'd say I finally found a company that is worth their salt."
1,STRAIGHT FROM THE SOUL,"EVERY LAST ALBUM OF MARY'S I CAN RELATE TO AND THIS ONE IS JUST THE SAME! MARY, KEEP IT UP."
0,Chewbacca should live,I hated this book and believe they should never have killed Chewbacca what a disapointment Chewbacca was the best.
0,Boring!!!,"Thought I would try John Grisham, but unfortunately I picked ""Bleachers"". I AM a football fan, but could not get past the first 25% of this book, it was just so BORING. Should I try another or are his books all this boring?"
1,Riveting!,"Definitely a story that will help you be involved.""The Starmen have learned that a mysterious alien race visited our Solar System thousands of years ago. Starman Zip Foster called them 'The Benefactors' because of the kindness these people showed the diminutive people who live on Titan. While they were on the tenth planet, the Starmen discovered that the Benefactors have a vicious, implacable enemy - the Xenobots, a violent race that is searching for its 'ancient enemy' and will demolish Earth if necessary to further the search. Zip Foster organizes a desperate search to find the Benefactors before the enemy does. Without their help, Earth stands no chance against the technologically superior Xenobots. With impeccable logic, the Starman leader has determined that if the Benefactors had a central base in teh Solar System, it had to be on Europa, one of the moons of Jupiter. What the Starmen do not even suspect is that there is also a powerful enemy close to home."""
0,I would not buy,"I purchased one (from a local store not Amazon.com), brought it home and printed a photograph that I had previously printed on a Kodak EasyShare printer (my mother-in-law's). The resulting photograp was horrible, it had a very green tint to it. I then adjusted the various enhancement controls within the printer, the green tint remained. I checked the troubleshooting section of the manual, checked/cleaned the print heads, and still the problem remained. Given that the product is still on the market, I suspect I had a broken unit.I did not like the LCD, it is very hard to read. I adjusted the contrast but it did not help. [...]."
1,Another Great Paranormal Romance,"One of the best short Vampire books I have read recently. It's original, fun, and interseting. I loved it. Those who liked Blood And Chocolate will absolutly adore The Silver Kiss. Short, sweet, and suprising in the end. Recommended to all!"
1,"Awesome toy esp. when you tape the ""money""","We first bought the ""Zillions"" cash register for our 4-year-old son, but we returned it right away because of its poor quality. This ""Learning Resources Teaching"" register is awesome! The size and materials are good, and it has great features. The electronic voice can't be turned off, but the volume can be controlled, and the voice is not annoying. I advise purchasers, upon receiving the register, to glue the yellow scale to its stand and pseudo-shellac the paper money by covering both sides with clear packing tape and then trimming off any excess with scissors. It works perfectly to preserve the money. I wasn't sure whether my son would like the built-in scanner (over the hand-held scanners included with some other registers), but he loves sliding household items across the button. The ""prices"" that show up for the scanned items are random, but this hasn't turned out to be a problem. Best toy cash register on the market!"
0,Too much unnecessary sexual content & violence,"I was appalled by the violence and sexual content in this show. No there are no full on sex scenes but several scenes where it goes too far in my opinion. The violence is also over the top in my view. I found the acting to be good and the storyline to have potential, but just like Eick's ""reinvented"" Battlestar Galactica, the bad far outweighs the good. Apparently Eick's reinventions always require adding sex and violence in order to sell the reinvention. I will pass on this show. I am an avid sci-fi fan. I have enjoyed Star Trek, Babylon 5, Quantum Leap and many other sci-fi shows, none which needed to rely on sex and violence to sell the show."
1,Cute and soft.,Very cute and soft plushy otter. Cuddly and stands up well to taking baths in my HE washing machine. Great quality for the price.

1,Great Book by a Great Guy,"Joe Burn's is a unique technical author that writes as if he is talking to you. I recommend this book to anyone-that includes the non-technical folks--interested in setting up his/her own website. WHY? Because this book IS for beginners. It is written in a simple to follow, easy to read style. I wish more technical authors would follow Joe's simple style for their writing. Highly recommended!Zev Saftlas, Author of Motivation That Works: How to Get Motivated and Stay MotivatedPS this book helped me open my own website!"
0,Fun to Read; Lousy History,"Truly a mess. No footnotes, lots of speculation, and plenty of cafeteria-style history (""I'll take one of these facts, and one of those...""). May appeal to the ""rum and strumpets"" fans but an absolute disaster of a 'history' book. If you want a book about the Crusades, stick with Runciman: not so much blood and garishness, but you won't be led astray. ""Dungeon, Fire and Sword"" is a dreadful book guaranteed to be warmly embraced by those who don't know any better."
0,Not Ready for Prime Time - not even the Soaps.,I agree with many of the negative reviews here. I say ditto. After trying several adapter cards and being no closer to being set up I gave up and returned the unit and all the adapter cards I tried
1,"Not good,But NEW!!!","Although it says its Good as its overall review for the book quality,THIS BOOK LOOKS,FEELS,AND IS BRAND NEW!!!!LOVE IT!!!!This book is the same exact thing as the ones you get in school."
1,MUSICAL BRAINS !,"This CD is the perfect example of mature POP music !Yes there is more to POP music than fluffy lyrics, a strong hook, a massive beat and a video with lots of spandex and a bleached blonde with a studded navel!BARENAKED LADIES, ""the Average-Jo boy band"" from Canada demonstrate that a successful POP CD can consist of intelligent pop songs.Their musical style becomes more solid on this effort as they create songs that make you think!Fans of the current pop trash (Britney, Christina, Clay; still trying to figure if he is a male or female artist) will not appreciate the subtext and musical undertones to this release.However, this release is one for a serious collector. This CD is stronger than their previous work."
0,The glamour of a looser??,"Some anthropologists argue that one of the characteristics of humans is the need to rationalise its actions no matter how absurd and contradictory they might be. Here, the main character decides to be a looser, as a consequence of its sexual ambivalence. However the would like to be nearby were the glamorous and the powerful gather to eat so he becomes a porter at the Four Seasons hotel in New York surviving from the tips offered by the wealthy patrons. So far so good as the topic of a novel. However, the author is incapable to offer a physiological portrait of Alexander Vine. The book is not disturbing, it is not funny, it is not shocking. You might get more insight about the sexual underground of New York watching 5 minutes of Sex and the City than from this book."
1,Best DT in years.,"This album is great, every song is played with alot of emotion and the instrumental is out of this world....Catchy and Melodic but Progressive and Technical at the same time....This is Dream Theater's best album since Scenes from a Memory IMO."
1,Another great one from Buble!,"Michael Buble has an amazing voice. This cd, his third full album is another great mix of classics and newer stuff. The single ""Everything"" is enough reason by itself to get the cd. There is something about that song that is pure joy. I love listening to it, and singing along with it. The classic Willie Nelson and Eric Clapton covers are lovely ballads. What a voice!"
0,Not suitable for Kindle,It is simply not readable in black&white and the drawings are not adapted to one single page....a waste of money!
0,Nope... Nope... Nope!!!,"I will not be doped into buying this Bluray twice like I did the DVDs. I will NOT waste my money on buying the ""theatrical version"" when I know full well that the studios will be releasing the ""extended version"" sometime in the near future. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM! Make the studios pay for this degrading and despicable way of doing business!!!"
1,Rollicking good macho BS fun,"Russell Crowe is excellent as Captain ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey, the head of the HMS Surprise. The movie details the skirmishes between the English Surprise and the French war ship, Acheron, set during the Napoleonic war. Captain Aubrey is a study in Leadership Values. He is a classic tragic figure, a hero with a fatal flaw. The revelation of the flaw is quite good but opposed to greek literature, Aubrey is finally triumphant not in overcoming his flaw but in that he is finally victorious (we believe) over the French ship. Oh well, I don't think it was intended to instruct us in higher moral values. Anyway, the movie is beautiful to look at, contains a dash of human interest (however, I did get a bit nervous about the lovely young men who served as midshipmen, etc), shows the comraderie that must have developed on such ships and from my 2004 perspective details daily life on board in an authentic manner. Recommended for a rousing good night of adventure."
1,fun enough,"This high quality game has lovely cards, a beautiful board, a fun 12-sided die, and very cool plastic dragon and dragonologist play pieces. This game is not too difficult to learn, and the play is fun. My one criticism is that winning winning is largely the result of luck. That is, die rolls and cards dictate how well you do, rather than strategy. Nevertheless, the ""cool"" factor elevates this game above other luck-based games."
0,Go back to the original published version!,"This ""uncut"" version, published thirty years after the original publication, shows how wise editors can be. The original ""Strangers"" is a great book, influencing a whole generation. The ""restored"" material in this version slows down the story, and its blatant sexism and dialogue are very offensive, dating the book. ."
1,Wonderful break from mint!,"I love this toothpaste due to the flavor. I have searched for a good alternative to mint, and have found it in this flavor. I am having more difficulty finding it in stores, though. Very disappointing. Will continue to search in stores, though, as I have grown to rely on this flavor. (Mint makes me gag.) Would recommend this to adults who are tired of the typical mint toothpaste. (great for kids too)"
1,"fun, brings a smile","Uplifting and light entertainment, makes me smile and laugh out loud, and also brings a tear or two. Its a good movie to inspire you."
1,Great Price & Fast Delivery,"I've used this product for years, and it works very well. We live near a pond and wooded area, and have two Chows with thick coats. By the time you find a tick it's usually dug in, and with Frontline they end up falling off."
0,sticks are not adiquate,"If you use these to test for ketosis, the sticks don't work. I have had one work and the others have not."
1,the snapper,"colm meaney and helen kellegher are so funny in this film. The family live in an overcrowded home in dublin suburbs. So much is going on all the time. To me this film is a perfect mix of serious and funny and the beauty of having your own copy is, if the Irish accent is difficult to understand you can watch it again and again.It's the best laugh and has aged well, still as funny as it ever was."
1,great soundtrack,this is a great soundtrack to a very great movie!!! i just wanted to know if anyone knows the name and artist of the song played at the beginning of the end credits. i can't find it anywhere and its not on any of the soundtracks! please email me if you know it!!!
0,where is my order?,didn't get my order. you sent me Tabatha Carney's order i sent it back to you now where is my order
1,Love it!,"I don't know how I managed so long without one of these pads on my bed. It's so comfortable, it amlost feels like a real Tempur-pedic bed! I love the thickness of the pad and it has held up well for my husband and I since we bought it a few months ago. I took it right out of the box and put it on my bed, I didn't notice any chemical smell. It rebounds nicely, no more dents where our bodies rest. The quality of the pad is very nice and I was happy that it arrived quickly. Not too hard, not too soft. Overall I'm very happy with my choice!"
0,Strong unit alright,"I'm sure this is a great unit but, unfortunately for me, this unit didn't work in my particular environment. I was using a handheld police radar unit. Approximately five minutes of being plugged into this unit, it managed to fry the power supply board and digital readout board. It cost me just under $275.00 to have the radar unit repaired. Use caution in what you plug into this unit."
1,This is hot!,"Uptown unplugged showcases some of the biggest names in R&B and hip hop fromn the 90's. Jodeci's hot rendition of ""Come and talk to me"" and Mary J. Blige's ""Sweet thing"" are just a couple of highlights from a show that has gone down in R&B history. This is one of the few concerts I have watched and will continue to watch time and time again."
0,Results not worth the (extreme) effort,"I've been working out off & on over the last 10 years.This years plan started with Power90, then INANITY (a new one for me) then P90X. Finished Power90, I was pumped up & looking forward to INSANITY.I don't half-ass my programs & want the best results, so of course I'm eating the right foods in the right amounts, 5 to 6 meals a day plus taking supplements.For me the results weren't worth all the ""Insanely"" hard works. I'll be starting P90X again. I get much better results from that.I think INSANITY may be for people younger & fatter then me."
1,Fantasia Has Finally Arrived!,"Fantasia!Fantasia!Fantasia!Girl you have finally arrived.I love the cd from beginning to the end.My co-worker told me that she loved the cd,and to go get it,so I did and she was right,the cd is just awesome.I love the whole cd,but my favorite tracks are (truth is,it's all good, you were always on my mind,and baby mama).Fantasia you are talented,and blessed keep up the good work.To all of the haters,can you do better, god don't like ugly,and ,if you do not have anything good to say,don't say anything at all!!!!!!!!!!!God Bless You Fantasia."
1,A Hit!,"I had the opportunity to read Preceived Notions and hurriedly picked up Twist of Fate as soon as it was available. Ms. Williams has presented another novel that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The characters, storyline, twists and turns, and the finale were just AWESOME. The pages came to life as she unfolded this satifying piece of work. She is definitely making a literary statement and I personally am hearing her, LOUD AND CLEAR. I can't wait for the next release."
0,Poor Quality,"I purchased this vest for a night relay - hoping it would fulfill requirements for safety lights front and back, with the ease of a vest. This vest is HUGE, but more important, it did not work. We tried everything, but could not get the lights to come on. Would not recommend this vest."
0,Alas! Good Compressor but it is small.,"I love the compressor. It is a good compressor I can tell. It is well made and operates confidently. Alas, it is small. I use it mainly as blow gun to clean my computer parts. Poosh poosh and the air is gonnnne. I can not clean 1 pc with it. I should have gone with 4-5 gallon tank at least. But then they will be heavy and bulky not usable in my rooms.update:8/27/2010 regulator died leaking air. It doesn't go above 100psi. -2 stars."
1,Pretty Good.,"This book is great for beginning javascript programmers who have a clue how to program. It is definitely not great for someone to learn the skill of computer programming. Additionally the excersices are not very challenging(I've only gotten up to the chapter on arrays, but the other chapter excersices leave little room for creativity).The good thing about this book is that it is a great way to learn the syntax of javascript. It does not have a lot of information and it has about three excersices per chapter(of what I have read so far. Overall it is worth the price though."
1,The best vacuum cleaner I've ever used!,This is the first vacuum I've owned that leaves no trace of scent behind in the air after vacuuming. The HEPA filtration system is fantastic. The HEPA filter (Model 3282) works great and I didn't even have to replace it for over a year which is much longer than the 6 months they recommend. I own the Bissell Healthy Home 6100 Vacuum and I can say it is the best vacuum cleaner I've ever purchase. I used to own Hoover products but they really went down hill as far as the quality of manufacturing goes along with many other problems. This thing works equal to the top Dyson or Kirby but at a fraction of the cost!
0,Not good,"Educational value: FairPresentation of the topic: PoorDraws attention of (my)kid: NoWorth the money?: NOEver since we bought this, we could play this only couple of times and now its taking eternal rest! Our child does not want to watch this any more."
1,I liove the smell of it but.....,"I looked at the picture and thought wow all of that for only 7 bucks that's a great deal! I bought it some of it was for me but some was for my mom on her anniversary! i only got 1 and it smells great, but i only got 1 bottel. Shipping is super high!"
1,It is worth the money if you like rap and hard rock,"This cd has a very good rythem to it. It is worth the money. It is a great mix of rap and hard rock.The best songs are Nookie, Break stuff, Im broke, nobody like you, 9 teen 90 nine, trust, no sex, and just like this. I think limp bizkit did well with the new album.You will be glad that you bought the cd."
0,"Tedious, Disconnected","I don't know why I finished reading The Eye in the Pyramid. It was a tedious flow of disconnects. Sure, it's a story about conspiracies dating back to Atlantis, but there was virtually nothing about the book to recommend, and saying so doesn't make me one of ""Them."""
1,Toby Marks rules,"While ""Last Train to Lhasa"" remains my all time favorite Banco de Gaia disk, ""Maya"" is the first public CD by BdG, and a superb introduction to the music. While Banco de Gaia, like many other ambient/techno entities, offers great dance beats, it soars above this basic form, creating something richer than most dance/dub/club sample music--something enticing and addictive that stands up to many repeated listenings...which is not something you can say about the majority of the music in the genre. Transcendent."
1,Fantastic!,"These roller shower curtain rings are so smooth and never snag. They are beautiful, too, in oil rubbed bronze -- understated and functional elegance!"
1,Love them!,Use them in my camera flash (fl-36). work hard and strong for a long time! I recommend this product.
1,For my Children,I bought two of these as I recall for both of my children since we sat up all night to watch that live performance...I live near Cleveland where it was held in our old Brown's stadium on Lake Erie. It went into the wee hours of the night and we watched the entire thing. This was to give to my children as a remembrance of that night when the Hall was opened here.
0,The Forgotten Album,"A lot has been written about this album, some good, some bad. This album (by U2 standards)is mediocre. Bono says himself that if they were starting out today and they released this as a second album, they would be dropped by the record label. A few highlights here like 'Fire','Gloria' and maybe at a push 'October', but other than that, nothing to write home about. Steve Lillywhite's production is raw and uneventful and the recording was 'rushed'. It is true that Bono's lyrics were stolen prior to recording which put added pressure on the limited resources that they had at the time. One to complete the collection but will probably not hit the CD-player too often."
1,Don't have to understand,"ok, so we first got this book as a gift @ the hospital. I read it to my baby once, thought it was stupid and never thought about it again. He's two now and LOVES this book. We got him the oversized (lap) version, and he won't put it down. I don't know why kids loves this book so much...Who says ""Goodnight Nobody""...?..Whatever...If he likes it, I love it."
1,The best battery charger I've owned!,"I give this 5 stars and would give it more if it were an option. This charger is FAST, usually less than 15 minutes. A great feature this has is that it has an internal fan to keep the unit and batteries cool. Everybody knows how fast temperture can ruin batteries. I like that there is a connection for the home or the 12v in vehicles. If your looking for a great charger... here it is.I actually bought two of these, one for a backup."
0,Good until the end,"While I've always found the theme of the ""Kingdom"" less personal that the King, this book does a good job of tracing that line of thinking through Scripture. My problem came with the author's end time view. It appears as if the author does not believe in a literal Millennium. He states on page 145 that it is, ""not meant to be understood literally."" If you hold to a literal view of the Millennium be aware that the author's view is different."
0,A cure for my insomnia...,"This movie almost put me to sleep. It's about a daughter of a brilliant (and dead) mathmetician played by Gweyneth Paltrow. She believes she may have inherited his insanity...blah blah blah...this movie has a good cast but it's really dull with a boring slow moving story. Maybe if you are into math formulas this will interest you. I found it anti-climactic. I kept wondering when something would happen and it never did. You never really get a solid answer in the end and it left me asking ""WTF?"" I would not watch it again unless I had insomnia and even then..."
0,Way Overated Band and CD,"I bought Great Southern Trendkill thinking Pantera was one of the greatest metal bands around. Turns out I was wrong. I can't believe I wasted my money . I praise Phil Anselmo's ability to scream for an entire album without having to take a breath. He uses the f-word more than 30 times each on the first two songs, the title song plus War Nerve. That said, this is a bad Cd by an even worse band. Don't buy it or anything by Pantera. You'll regret it. At least I got my money back to buy a Preist CD."
1,Review of book shipment/receipt,"Book arrived as promised, perfect shape, will order again no question!"
0,A disappointment,"While it worked, which wasn't for very long it did a good job of removing most, though not all debrie. I would floss after using the water-flosser and would still find a very small amount of food particles. However it did impart a feeling of 'clean' and I liked using it.THE REALLY BAD: It stopped recharging in less than a year. The company replaced it with another which also stopped recharging in less than a year! The overall design is not as functional as it should be. It is difficult to take apart for cleaning or to change the tip.Bottom line: I miss using it but expensive, considering its short lived life."
0,Don't WASTE your money!,"Sounds like a good idea, but this thing just does not work very well.....it's like listening to an FM station that you ALMOST get...signal goes in and out, while other stations bleed through. I returned mine the day after I bought it!!! Stick with the old-style cassette adapters. Sorry Belkin, you tried!"
1,Love it!,"I had a hard time finding a coat tree that was a modern style, without paying a lot for it. Even though this one was relatively inexpensive, it looks great and is very sturdy! I like how it has many pegs to hang from and also has the umbrella stand. I am very pleased with it!"
1,great fan if you dont mind the noise,I recently purchased this fan as a replacement for my vornado. When compared to my vornado I feel that this fan moves as much air but definitely isn't as quiet. While it's not as noisy as cheaper box fan alternatives I don't recommend using it as your bedroom fan while trying to sleep unless your used to the sound. The fan itself looks very well made and has an extremely solid feel to it. I have had this fan for a little over a year ago and am still as happy with it as the day i got it. If your looking for a decent priced fan that can move alot of air this is it.
1,"Good overall, but needs some doctoring.","This is a great sheath for any of the Leatherman Juice series multi-tools. The only drawback is the fact that it clips onto the belt, rather than having a loop for the belt to slide through. This feature makes it easy to slip off and lose your Leatherman.aboutTo fix the problem, simply do what I did: tear off a piece of black duct tape about 12-inches long, and cut it longways in half. Then, taking one of the thin strips of tape, wrap it around the bottom of the sheath, creating a closed loop through which to slide your belt.With this slight doctoring, I never have to worry about losing my sheath and Leatherman XE6."
0,Will not work with IPAQ,"I bought this modem at CompUSA for ..., took it home and hurriedly unpackaged it and slipped it into the unwieldy IPAQ sleeve and was ready to go. Then I got an ""unrecognized CF card"" error. I tried again. No dice. I did a soft reboot. No luck. I took it back to the store and tried another one out of the box. No luck. I took my IPAQ back to the other retailer (BB) and tried another CF sleeve. Then another IPAQ unit. Still no go. I called Tech Support for both Compaq and the manufacturer. Compaq made me do a hard reset (in which I lost everything)."
1,Excellent,"I have been very impressed with this radio. The S.A.M.E. technology makes the difference. I can also go through a list to select only the alerts I'm interested in receiving. I am not annoyed at it when it goes off, in fact it's in my kitchen and now I can get the daily weather every morning and listen to the radio when I cook. I love it."
1,Great glass,The lense was everything I expected from professional opinions. I knew going in that my D40 would only manual focus so I was prepared for the extra effort to focus on my subjects. I did test the lens on a D70s and auto focus was fast and quiet.
0,meh,"not so much, quality seemed fine but the cut made me look like a took a poo. I felt like the like the crotch was cut low."
1,Replay value is off the charts,"One of only a few shows I can honestly say that I have watched many times through. I love Michael Hall and have loved him since Six Feet Under. It was hard to see him as a straight man in this serious for an episode or two and then I got used to it. That was the only hitch but not anyone's fault. People write horrible reviews for Dexter because their sense of morality feels to be in jeopardy by watching it. Its a great show. Depth, cliffhanger suspense, peril, gritty insight into each character as the seasons pass, unexpected twists. You really cant get better television than you get with Dexter. By far my favorite show ever put on the screen. Blu ray is definitely worth the extra few dollars as it is masterfully done both in sound quality and picture clarity. I LOVE THIS SHOW."
0,"Watch out, other Petzyl Tikkas are great, but not this one!","I've depended on Petzyl Tikkas for daily use for years, and didn't even understand how there was variation between them, considering they are named the same. But this one does not have the button for 3 light settings (hi, lo, blink), it just has on/off, which for me is too bright for reading with new batteries. It also is somehow made with inferior machining (or mine are bad luck) because for 1st time this one doesn't provide steady light, but occasionally flickers a bit like the connections are iffy. Which is more irritating than it may seem. Not like a candle, more like a constant reminder to swat your head and see if the thing gets fixed. So, go for the slightly more expensive Tikkas that have the button, not slide switch, and have never in my history of owning 6 flickered."
1,"worth a read, but not worth the price","an entertaining and insightful, if short, glimpse into the lifestyle, if not life, of one of the greats of the west coast jazz scene of the early 1950s. the lack of details leads me to believe what was published here is, in reality, only an outline for a book which never quite materialized. a shame because this book gives you just enough information to make you realize that baker's life story would indeed make not only a great book, but movie as well. unfortunatly, there is hardly any material of substance here and the entire book could be read in less than an hour and a half. i would recommend it to those with an interest in the west coast jazz scene who are interested in a first-hand supplement to other, more in-depth, if after-the-fact, volumes on the subject. but i would suggest that, with only about 60 pages of actual text you would be better off reading it in the book store or checking it out from the library."
1,decent (3.5 stars),"lemme start off by saying DEAD WRONG IS ILL and eminem rips that track up, even better than big. other standouts include ""notorious big"" and ""rap phenomenon"" (which features the classic line 'all them rings and things you sing about bring em out / its hard to yell when the barrel's in ya mouth', which was used by jay-z on ""what more can I say"", and the jay version was sampled by swizz beats on last years hit ""bring em out"" by t.i.). the rest of the tracks range from good to bad, and none are outstanding like the first two.buy it if you love big, otherwise just get the few best tracks from itunes."
1,"Good, but Ten was better","This album is pretty good. I don't like it as much as I liked Ten, but there's some really awesome songson this one. ""Go"", ""Animal"" and ""Daughter"" are especially good. Mike McCready plays some awesome solos. He's great with a wah wah pedal. Stone keeps playing the original rythym riffs he's know for. Eddie always gives a great vocal performance. Pearl Jam is definitely my favorite grunge band. But overall, this album just didn't have the same effect on me that Ten did. That doesn't mean it's not worth buying though, I'm glad I have it."
1,If you can only buy one book of style - this should be it.,"I have long been an admirer of Ms Dano - from Another World, to Attitudes on Lifetime, to One Life to Live, to QVC. She has a wonderful style about her that makes one take notice without being overpowering or too over the top.This book is a really helpful guide of finding your own style and building your own wardrobe. She helps you thru the difficult parts and shows you how to build - one piece at a time. She gives so many helpful hints on accessorizing to keep your look fresh rather than faddish. And the very best of all, it can be attained affordably!I took her advice to heart and have the beginnings of a wonderful wardrobe that will help me to keep stylish for years.Heck, it even helped me to win an award for personal style.Thanks, Ms. Dano, for a much needed book for the average woman."
0,Not waterproof,"This mat is just ok. Yes it folds nicely but I learned the hard way that this is NOT waterproof in any way. We went to the park and the grass was a little damp, after a few minutes I realized that my pants were all wet!!! I cant return it now so it will have to do for the beach or wherever its completely dry."
0,"too bad, too sad","I want to change the world sounds noble enough but with the fluff in between these covers, this ""world changer"" has some time, if ever, to go until he can lay any claim to this. Karims fellow designers should be outraged by his presentation of their industry as being so fickle, tranparent and thin. A real shame given the power that products have in our lives and to our cultures. Do not buy this book."
0,Cheap,"Well, they say that you get what you pay for. That would be true if you can find this on sale for $50 of less! If you are used to particle board furniture, this will suit you fine. If you have higher standards, spend more and avoid this. Some of the pieces cracked as screws went into the pre-drilled holes in the particle board. Several pieces arrived damaged. We had to request 3 replacement parts from the manufacturer and are still not happy with it, but now it is assembled and impossible to ship back so we are stuck with it. If you do buy this and get it assembled, try not to move it around too much, as it may fall apart. Also, the drawers are very shallow. Don't expect to store much in this. It did arrive promptly, but the shipper and Target would have done me a favor if they had lost it instead of delivering it!"
1,First Men in the Moon,As ever HG Wells stories are exciting. The B Movie sci fi genre brought many of Wells' stories to life.
1,Love these,"Durable, fit well, stay snug, warm, great work gloves. You can't touch this deal. Prime shipping- I mean come on, this is great!"
0,No likey,"I bought 2 of these and 1 of them is a menace, always going off in the middle of the night and we can't shut it off. So, we keep it outside in the garage but it still goes off sometimes. The other one is not going off for no reason, but if it gets bumped out of the outlet- the shrill is relentless and it is not easy to reset. The directions are on the back of this thing, but you have to sit through the shrilling beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeppp while you read the instructions. It's enough to drive a person CRAZY. Babies are screaming, pets are running. It's unnecessarily loud."
1,"Thoughts on ""The Children are Free""",I have not finished reading it yet but it makes good points and has been and will be helpful to some extent. I recommend it to anyone who struggles in this arena.
1,VERY VERY GOOD!,I just had to tell you I agree with the other reviewers. This book is a must if you plan to show dogs.
1,i love this movie i think its the best 1!,"i love this movie i think its the most intertaining one , i think this movie is better than the others made by far i love all harry potter movies but i think this one is my favorite also i have never read any of the books so i dont know what im missing i have heard that the books are way better they probably are but i still love the harry potter movies! i think they should be longer and include more information but i like!"
1,The Best Ever,"While this well written and informative book is designed primarily to appeal to those unable to tolerate wheat and gluten it should not be restricted to only the digestively challenged. If, like me, you enjoy baking you will be intrigued and inspired by all the many alternative flours available and the techniques employed in using them. You'll want to try out the many recipes for cakes, cookies, muffins, and other goodies, and you`ll be rewarded by the tasty results. I especially liked the banana nut muffins."
1,Good Book,"This is the autobiography of a school teacher in Northern Kentucky, he comes across different obstacles some of those 2 churchs that have divided the county almost like opposing armies, violent students and many other problems. Be he still runs a successful country school.""The Needles Eye That Does Supply'""The Thread That Runs So True!"""
1,Great pair of light duty gloves,"I love these gloves. I got them mostly for driving, and I've made a few trips now. They keep my hands nice and toasty, and the deerskin is great material--it grips the wheel very firm, doesn't slip or anything like that. The lining is very soft and comfortable and the gloves have a lot of mobility, and slide on and off the hand easily.I think they changed the construction of the product versus what's described and pictured. Instead of ""Thinsulate"" mine came with ""Thermofill"" insulation, and doesn't have the ""Thinsulate"" tag. Still very warm though, and still 100% polyester insulation.Oh and while they're not for heavy abrasive work, they're still tough enough for most things I would use gloves for. On the other hand the deerskin is super soft, so I could see it getting scratched, embedded with dirt, etc. really easily. I think they're tough enough for light-to-moderate tasks and just for keeping your hands warm while doing them."
0,total hogwash,"This writer is still at a very rudimentary level of spiritual awareness and completely deluded about his own degree of perceptivity and insight.The most ridiculous aspect of this book is that he equates high socio-economic status with spiritual accomplishment. IOW, if you deliver the mail, you are at a low spiritual level, if you are a CEO, you are at a high level, closer to Jesus and the Buddha. That would of course be the Jesus who worked as a carpenter!I believe that the purpose of life is spiritual growth and we choose our families based on the lessons we need to learn in that incarnation. I doubt there is much correlation between income and spiritual accomplishment. There are many beings of great light, who will live their lives in complete obscurity, as they polish the last remaining vestiges of pride, self-will and fear off their noble souls."
1,Very Underrated Game,"BMX XXX is alot like the Dave Mirra series. If you are not familiar with the series, Dave Mirra BMX games have tight controls,huge levels and creative tasks to complete. BMX XXX is not as good as Dave Mirra, but mirrors alot of it's traits. The controls are not as tight but they are not shot. The graphics are about the same as is the size of the levels. The tasks you have to complete are actually better in this game because they add funny,crude funny but funny, tasks that you will want to complete just to see the reactions of the characters in the game. Don't buy this game if your looking for nudity though, there isn't much. But if your looking for a good BMX game, this is it. Not great, but good."
0,Nothing shocking here.,"As for the editorial review, that guy must be high to even mention the frontwoman of this band and Chrissie Hynde in the same sentence. I usually don't even read the editor reviews on Amazon because I have not found one that actually critizes any of the bands or musicians they review. I don't know about you but can every single group in the world be good. As far as this album goes, it is a definant turn for the worse for these guys, in fact aside from their first works they really havn't done anything of value. In my opinion they should have left the catalog just the way it was."
1,Aquis Microfiber Towel,Great towel and nice large size. Lightweight but absorbs water quickly. I am going to buy more I like this towel so much.
0,Not a 3-pronged plug,Any devices with a ground (3-pronged plug) can't be used with this. It would have been helpful if the Amazon description or images showed this.
1,Master of UK streets,"This book has all the essence of Banksy's work, and let you understand why he is a genius, why he does what he does and how his art apart from scandalous sometimes is the reflexion of the things seen in a beautiful way or make the most crude denounce in the most incredible way. A total must-have"
0,Predator prompts first-ever review...,"As an avid fan of Patricia Cornwell's novels, I eagerly dove in to 'Predator.' I would rate it as an average thriller, but it definitely missed the mark in the ongoing Scarpetta series. No closure to any of character issues;dark and brooding interactions that generated little sympathy for Lucy, Scarpetta, or Marino; and an ending that made me say ""so what?"""
0,First review but I had to warn others...,"I wanted so badly to like this case. It has a small slot to put my debit card, license, and my insurance card. And that's what I really wanted (an ""all in one on the go"" case so i don't have to carry my wallet when I go to the store)When I first had the case the phone fit snugly and worked well... UNFORTUNATELY it just started to fall apart after just a couple weeks. The clip (like many others here have said) wore away and basically ripped off. Now I have to be very careful as the phone will sometimes fall off my belt. I returned the product and got another one thinking ""okay maybe I had a lemon""... nope same exact thing happened. The leather stitching wore away and the belt clip basically fell off again. Fool me once shame on you... fool me twice shame on me. So now I'm on Amazon looking for something else that will serve my needs. If you're looking for a hip case I would definitely move on from this one and look for something more secure."
0,Disappointed,"The quality of the blue ray was excellent, but the movie itself was bad. This was big disappointment for Andrew Lloyd Weber. No outstanding music and plot was boring."
1,"Tastes horrid but I think it all does, no matter the brand.",I'm sure this product does what it says but it tastes horrible. Just being honest. I think they should flavor it or something?
1,very relaxing cd,"nice, relaxing, yet can some of the songs are upbeat - love that ""edge of the ocean"" song - great cd"
1,Drop it in your pocket.,"I am completely satisfied with this product. I started using pedometers several years ago in order to get some idea of how much I walked each day and to motivate myself to walk more. However, I never really felt comfortable strapping one onto my belt at work and I was constantly taking it on and off to see how far I had walked. This product is simple to use---just drop it in your pocket and forget about it. It takes up little space and is very easy to use. It also seems to be very accurate. Furthermore, I like that it resets itself automatically at midnight each day and allows you to check back easily on the past 6 days' results. The aerobic feature is very useful too as it allows you to distinguish regular steps from ""aerobic steps."" I have had several pedometers over the years but this, by far, is the best and the easiest to use."
0,knockoffs?,I received the trains today opened them & realized that annie and clarabel have the same facial expression painted on. This can't be possible because this is the way the children distinguish them. This item claims to be learning curve when in reality it reads on the bottom of the train TOMY and made in the UK. Im confused because all of my sons trains say learning curve except for these. Are these Knockoffs?
1,There new album (2001) is some what better.,"Yeah, I found this cd in my searching for more music from there 2001 cd, Journey To Jah (which is for anyone who likes reggea thats not like what the stereotypical reggea sounds. It's for the younger listeners I feel and almost like rap but not. I got this album along with a live one and there newest one. All of which are worth a purchase, or a download because there very hard to find."
0,It is alright.,"My question is what would they do without all the witch hype.( Dont you think that ""The Witch Schtick"" has been overplayed)I bought the CD and the songs where ok. The singer voice is good. However, some of the PAINFULLY midi sounding music featured on this CD was akin to a sixth graders music project.I expected a better quality of music."
1,"Beautiful, pure voice","A wonderful singer from the sixties. Her voice is pure as Baez, but has a better range. My only criticism is that the backup music in some of the songs is unnecessary and detracts from her performance. All she needs is a guitar."
0,Strawberry Shortcake: The Berryfest Princess,"My 2+ year old daughter didn't like this animated cartoon of Strawberry Shortcake as the characters looked different from the original cartoon series. She couldn't recognize Blueberry Muffin and insisted that wasn't her. Also, Pupcake has green polka in this animation, while its blue polka in the original. And they weren't many songs in this animated cartoon. I thought the songs were the main attraction for this cartoon. So, my daughter didn't find it interesting, rather boring with too much dialogue."
0,Couldn't Finish It!,"I am greatly surprised by the positive reviews this book generated. It started off with an interesting premise, a girl from the wrong side of the tracks trying to rise to the top of the business world, but the novel sagged midway inexplicably. The suspense and interest for me stopped. The characters became dislikable. I found it hard to generate sympathy for pampered, whiny twenty something year-olds. Yes, Laura was treated unfairly by being stripped of her inheritance, but her and Clay reacted to this as if it were a major catastrophe. Clay is a spoiled brat while Laura is cold and uninteresting. Why Paul and Wex find this bland woman so fascinating is beyond me. It also became tiresome to read about the characters' outlandishly wealthy, privileged lives. They seemed to live a fake, superficial existence. The writing team of Judith Michael succeeded in doing only one thing with this novel. They made the lives of the rich and famous look incredibly shallow."
0,Should Have Stayed Bachman,"In his typical fashion, Stephen King leads us to believe in the first few paragraphs that he may have finally returned to the voice that we all fell in love with. Sadly, this is not the case.""Cell"" is as badly contrived a novel as I could have ever imagined. One-dimensional characters, a farcical style and voice, his ever-present use of slang words for anatomy, and his creepy penchant for including teenaged girls in his stories. King's use of street-level geography bogs down the reader, making us concentrate more on where his characters are physically rather than where they are emotionally. Anyone unfamiliar with Massachusetts is apt to put down the tome in a few minutes, once they get past the macabre opening scenes in which people jump from skyscrapers and gnash at each others' throats with their teeth.Unfortunately, the days of the King are gone, leaving us all wishing for Bachman in all his glory."
0,Too hot to use,I was excited to use this device but cannot use it because it's too hot for my skin. I tested it out first on my arm and it was burning hot! My mother tested it out on her arm but felt fine. Luckily it came with a 30 day money back guaranteed. If your skin is sensitive to heat don't have high hopes for Zeno.
0,ARGHHH!,"I will not say that AMAZON should have the zero-star rating, because zero is too much for this band. Technically the boys are okay, but it seems it's all they care about. Poor songwriting, lack of personality ( 1000 bands sound like this ) and a thin, ugly voice on top of that. Believe you me, stay away!"
1,Good valve for the money,"These bags work well. I purchased these because to me a vacuum bag is a vacuum bag. The only difference between these bags and the Kirby bags are the ease of installation. I had a hard time putting the bag on. The Kirby bags have two notches that allow ease of installing, these do not. Which is why I gave four stars instead of five. Otherwise, it works."
0,Does Not Work,"I bought one of these at a local store to use with my Dell computer, but it does not work. The old keyboard I wanted to use is not recognized by the computer."
0,It makes an annoying beeping sound,"It appears to work just fine for getting rid of mice, but the red light flashes and emits a small beeping/clicking sound. The one in the garage doesn't bother us, but the one that meant to be used in the house was too annoying."
0,bad,it is the worse invesment i have done. they do not last and smell like burnfrom the inside get a better brand
1,Turkeys arn't easy to hunt,Well turkeys in the real world are not easy to hunt therefore they should not be easy on the game. This game has done it's job well. As for long weapons they are very rarely used for turkey hunting. Traditonal turkey hunters use close in weapons such as this game does... Two thumbs up.
1,"Take this seriously, seriously","Ostensibly country and western, Stompin' Tom belongs more rightly to the binomial ""metropolitan and hinterland"", the urban vs. small town axis that marks the Canadian landscape. Stompin' Tom (the name comes from his literal big foot stomping while playing guitar, made famous in the 70's) writes extraordinarily funny songs rich in ultra-local colour and disarming simplicity, which makes some wonder if this guy's serious. So much so that he stopped playing altogether for some 15 years because ""people don't take me seriously"", dedicating himself to producting and other such stuff. Popular acclaim has drawn him somewhat back to his pale limelight. For music buffs the closest American reference would be Jonathan Richman (as with Richman, it really doesn't matter which CD you listen to). One of those quirky Canadian thangs that Americans occasionally (like Moosehead -remember?- beer) get a taste for."
0,Not recommended,"When I received this product, the grip was already dirty and it is very hard to put it on a bike. It get dirty very easily. I don't recommend this product."
0,i actually threw this book across the room,"never have i loathed a book as much as this book. when i had to read the abomination ""The Scarlet Letter"" as a kid I thought it couldn't possibly be worse then two page sentences and entire paragraphs describing a bush. I WAS WRONG!!I absolutely hated this book and I made it until the pages went wonky and then I just go so mad I threw it across the room, then in the trash- something i have never done before."
0,Product description is inaccurate...,"Nice bag, but I bought the silver/black version and the waist straps ARE NOT removable. This is quite an annoyance since the waist strap is basically useless-it does not affect your load bearing and is barely functional. An earlier review said that the waist straps are 'velcroed' in place. I must have the early version because my waist straps are sewn in place harder than a Yosemite tick. I would not recommend this pack."
1,This book is all of that and more!,"I love this book...and I am the beginner in looking at dolls. In fact, I am on Amazon looking for Volumn III. This book is the best for anyone."
1,great product,"I wasn't disappointed in this product. As I would expect, these Tommy Hilfiger sheets are of great quality at a good price."
0,Don't waste your money....,"This game is about as much fun as getting your teeth drilled. The action is very choppy and you cannot keep your ""Girl"" on the ground. Also this game claims to have vibration function, which it does not. The only reason it gets one star is because I cannot go any lower according to this rating system. ... my money has just gone down the toilet never to be seen again. ..."
1,Fits American Deluxe Stratocaster like a glove,"It fits my Fender American Deluxe Stratocaster like a fine glove. Well built, good latches, feet and carrying handle. Plenty of storage for spare strings, strap locks, strap etc.This was a bargain compared to other cases I looked at."
1,"Great, but not the definitive take on Apollo","In 'Shadow' you get to hear voices that are infrequently heard from in other Apollo films: Collins, Scott, Schmidtt, Mitchell. This a pleasant surprise.Michael Collins, Al Bean and Charlie Duke really carry this movie. Their candor and humor bring a humanity to the film. John Young, Edgar Mitchell and David Scott also evoke emotional responses but in a vastly more subtle and understated manner. I could have done without Aldrin and Cernan, both of who continue to exhibit tremendous self-regard all these decades.A very personal film that is a worthwhile collection to any space buff's library. Also, it is a good movie for those who did not live thru that era but wish understand some of the men inside those machines."
1,Hanson Square,"Extremely handy product Lays out perfect square sides for forming, tile laying etc. I recommend it for any project that needs to be perfectly square. Also, I recommend getting a short section of 3 inch PVC and two caps to keep the square inside of if you place it in a tool box."
0,Don't make my mistake,"I decided I wanted a headset so that I could talk on the phone while doing work or cooking around my house. I looked at both this Uniden headset and the AT&T one that is also sold on Amazon. Even though I read the reviews on here that said this headset can easily break I went ahead and bought one for cheap off the Amazon.com Outlet. I used it for a few months and was pretty happy with it. It was comfortable on my head, easy to adjust, sounded good, and I never got any complaints from people I was talking to.Then it broke.So now I'm about to shell out some more money for the AT&T headset and I figured I'd share my new found wisdom with everyone else."
1,Great American Set,This provides an excellent tour of our National Parks. We are so lucky in these United States of America.
0,wish-I-knew,"Yuk - I heard Almay's eye makeup removers were some of the best - But, Not this one! It was way too wet & greasy. I even had trouble getting that greasy feel off my hands. I had to throw them out and would never buy them again. (I tried to give no stars, but the review would not accept zero stars.)"
1,"Great for toaster ovens, easier/faster than a little breadmaker","After many uses it works fine but not completely non stick. Instead of Pam, I use Crisco brand nonstick spray which is 100 % canola oil (canola and olive are the healthier oils for your heart).The oatbran recipe calls for 1 tablespoon canola or olive oil, I use only 2 teaspoons of oil and the spray adds the other 1 teaspoon per six muffins.I don't have time for making bread every day, muffins way faster and just as good."
1,Laid-back-drive-through-the-country album! ROCK ON!,"I had the pleasure of seeing these guys live, and before they strap on their guitars, it just seems like this would be another simple rock show. Until they break out with ""Breathe"" as their opening song. BOOM! This guys play a show better than what you think it's gonna be. You won't be able to mosh or anything at their shows, but you can have DAMN good time just listening to them play live. As for just the album itself, songs such as ""Cowboy Hat"" and ""Leader of Men"" give you that Alice In Chains/Matchbox 20 feel. Good, laid back rock album! And a VERY powerful vocalist. Just so you know, the lead singer told me that ""Leader of Men"" is about KILLER MUSHROOMS. Well, I'm not into drugs or anything, but it seems these guys love a good joint every now and then; but you can't bash 'em for that. Check out ""The State"", and just sit back and enjoy its melodic presence."
1,A stirring fantasy novel based in post-apocolyptic England.,"The first book in the sword of the spirits trilogy, this novel portrays a young man, and his journey, which unexpectedly leads him to become a prince. This stunning novel introduces you to the second iron age, after an apocolypse. In the tradition of other writings by John Christopher, this story can be appreciated on many levels"
0,A bitter man can't handle the truth,"Maybe Mr. Bugliosi should read the countless follow-ups to the election by the Miami Herald and other major newspapers that clearly state George W. Bush would have won the election if the re-counts in Florida had continued.Funny how he conveniently forgets this part in his book.It appears Mr. Bugliosi needs the limelight again after the Manson Murder case no longer provides it to him.Bugliosi bases one of his tenants of his argument on Justice Scalia saying further recounts ""would do irreperable harm to George Bush"". Bugliosi totally misinterprets Scalia's argument. The point was if ballots that were not deemed credible were counted for one party or the other in one part of Florida and not in the other, could in fact change the results in an unfair basis.Get over it Mr. Bugliosi. Stick to writing something credible. This was a waste of..."
1,this tracie long video is the core of my workout.,"it took me a minute to realize i had this tape under the name All weights since around 1998. i am disappointed as for a minute there i thought i missed buying one of tracies workouts. i've said in other reviews for her other videos ( The tortoise and the hare scuplting with weights etc) i just love tracie long as an instructor. i have lost serious inches due to this fun and tough workout. and i just love also the other firm workouts, they are tough but they WORK.. Thanks!"
0,Quit Less than a Third of the Way Through,"Every third page is a sermon on how to treat animals with respect. I got the point by the fifth time time around. The 10th through the 20th sermons were tad bit tiresome. Not sure how this book ever became known as a classic. I've never seen the movie, but it must be better than this book. Time to read more E.B. White, C.S. Lewis, Astrid Lindgren, Roald Dahl, etc. for bedtime stories. I quit reading this less than a third of the way through."
0,DVD does'nt work by routine is excellent,I enjoy this routine very much. 40 minutes and a good stretch. However I keep having problems with the DVD. I have purchased three copies to date. Each has had problems operating in the DVD player. The last copy won't play at all. Very frustrating.
0,Repugnant Rubbish,"Just when you thought the French couldn't sink any lower along comes Irreversible. Told in reverse this film is essentially a tale of revenge however unlike other films in this genre this film lacks any class and goes straight for the juggular. Whilst much of the debate over this film surrounds the infamous 10minute rape sequence, an act of violence towards the start of the film is perhaps the most violent and reprehensible scene ever committed to celluloid. Stobe lights and crazy camera movements drive the viewer to reach for the sick bag rather than be dazzled by the director's attempts at stylistic meaning and the main characters are all shallow, unlikeable people. This film is an ugly and pretentious attempt at displaying the darker side of human nature and the concepts of fate and time however ends up wallowing in its own sordid mess losing any messages it was trying to make in the process. Watch for a curiosity or shock piece only."
1,A Great Movie,Cady's passion never dies. This is the art of this movie: it perfectly paints a picture of a student who will not give up the only thing that can't be taken away from her-- her desire.
1,So many Key Points you can lose track,I found this book to be well written and an excellent resource for any organization who feels like they have either a lot or a little wasted time in meetings.Needs to be read more than once and use a highlighter to keep track of all the key points...A must have reference
1,"Fun, unique and durable boot","My son wore these for Halloween and it really made his fire fighter jacket and helmet look more authentic. He loves these boots. The straps are a nice feature and they are durable. The sizing seems accurate. As far as the number significance, it is a sensitive subject that I don't think small children need to be informed about."
1,It's time for balance,"Jimmy Carter has written a superb book that is but another step on the road towards peace in the region. Current US foreign policy in regards to the region is simply an extension of right-wing Israeli policy. This has not worked thus far. Hopefully future US policy can be more impartial leading the road to peace. Bashing Carter's Presidency, former profession, et al is nothing but shooting the messenger and ignoring the facts on the ground. Until the moderates in all camps start to have more influence we will have nothing but more bloodshed. Imagine Northern Ireland with Ian Paisley calling the shots. Thankfully he is sidelined and there is peace. Thank you, Jimmy Carter, for having the courage to stand up to those whom the status quo is the only acceptable opinion."
0,Wrong one :l,I ordered the black and gold plug but they sent the chrome one. I know it's not that big of a difference but it still bothers me.
0,Teabagger fodder,"Utterly horrible. Fabricated right wing propaganda.This doc contains the usual emotionally charged rhetoric aimed to elicit a highly adverse reaction to the subject of the doc. Picture a field populated by brain dead conservative sheep, drooling, with the occasional look of total racial hatred flashing across their faces. What is sad is that they are easily swayed by scary words like ""socialism""! When for some odd reason they are totally unaware of the corporate socialism that has created a huge chasm between what is increasingly becoming the super rich, and the peasants. I would not be surprised if this was funded by the koch brothers."
0,Hammered Metal Knobbly Guys????,The examples in this book will lead you to career ruin. They are laughable. Save your money.
0,Bravery,"This offering is intended for an audience to run through in a light hearted manner, but it bored me silly. I was lost in the silly girl in quest of changing her mother's mind to the wild extreme of making a deal with a witch and turning her mother into a bear, sorry it just did not resonate for me."
1,You get what you pay for,"I thought that these were the 2500 NiMH which are $12.95 for 4. These were 8 for the same price. They are rechargeable NiMH, but are not quite as powerful as the 2500s. No complaints other than I should have known that you get what you pay for."
1,Olympus Stylus 750,"Great camera except that the Stabilizer does not always work as per the instructions. Is great for close-up work. The multitude of menus take a bit of time to figure out but once deciphered, are fairly simple to use. Very good value."
1,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"This is one of those direct-to-video gems that every b-movie fan hopes to find. There was virtually no advertising or information about this film when it first came out. It just showed up on the shelves at blockbuster and people had to take a chance on it. I'm glad I did, because it is one of the best original science fiction films of the 90s. Charlie Sheen was terrific as the nerdy scientist Zane. Zane works for NASA and when he brings some strange readings to his bosses they ignore it and fire him. Unwilling to let it go, Zane travels to Mexico to uncover the truth, and you won't believe what he finds. It's a strong cast and a great story that is full of surprises. If you enjoy sci-fi, than this should be on the must see list!"
0,"Please, Don't Waist You Time and Money. . .","This product does not live up to the name or discription. My purpose for buying this product was to have it connect my dishnetwork DVR to the phone wall jack. After many attempts and several call to customer support, the product still did not work. I ended up shipping the product back for failure to live up to its purpose, and the poor support the company gave to this product. Not recommended at any cost."
1,Very Useful,"I am a new player and found this book to be very useful in finding the proper fingering for the chords I am using in the music I am playing. The book is created to be easily read and logically displayed for the beginner and ""power user."""
1,Skill to perfection,"I bought this albumn, and immediately I can say: ""dont wait"". Tina's voice truly comes out, especially in the quieter, slower songs. Although some tunes may not be as catchy as in the CD ""In Deep"" or as powerful as in ""Dont ask""; both of which are excellent, ""Souvenirs"" gives you a good impression, especially of her years in France. Overall, it was outstanding, and could be internationally considered."
1,Works Perfectly,Does exactly what it's supposed to do. Solid build. My Fluke clamp meter fits easily through the openings. Great deal.

0,Buy McAfee and get pestered with their own promo pop-ups,"Life with McAfee is hell. Eleven months after you buy the product, the software starts to generate pop-ups which advertise their promotions. These pop-ups are impossible to disable. Think of the worst spam you've ever had. This is worse. Don't touch this prodct."
1,Amazing Book,"This book was so exciting, I couldn't put it down. If there is only one book you read all year, it should be this one. Victor Carl starts out on a seedy mission of revenge, but slowly comes to believe his hapless client is innocent. How he goes about proving it is amazing, and I don't want to give anything away, but you won't be sorry you read this book."
1,not silly,"""Revisioning Italy"" is a collection of essays exploring contemporary Italian culture, including literature, cinema, the media, and other such cultural elements. A book like this might be called ""cultural criticism,"" and while that might not be everyone's cup of tea, the open-minded will find this book to be a long-awaited treasure trove of ideas and theories about contemporary Italy. The articles themselves are well-researched and well-written. The previous reviewer describes this book as ""silly."" Really the only ""silly"" thing is his easy dismissal of this interesting book, and especially his seemingly arbitrary assertion that the selections by Italian writers are better when there are so many interesting contributions from non-italian academics here."
0,The Most Awful Ending Ever Filmed,"Aside from a suspenseful sequence with Courtney Cox trapped in a recording studio, this movie is just terrible. Jerry O'Connell tries valiantly, and Courtney and David are fun to watch together, but this sequel forgets that it isn't satire if it's just as bad as the thing it's satirizing (like.. oh.. Friday the 13th Part 5). But worst of all is the ending: beyond stupid, it drags and drags and drags... how can any of the fans of this movie bear to sit through yet another LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG ""Why I had to do it"" explanation by the killers? It's not funny, it's just plain BAD."
0,Not all it could have been,"This book is far, far, far from what it could have been. Yes, there is some interesting thought here but not enough for 197 pages. This book is definitely not for the average Evangelical but useful for the scholarly Evangelicals. C. R Biggs ""Biggsman"" review will be better than the book for many people."
1,Great movies,these are great movies and i recommend the extended version to anyone who likes the lord of the rings trilogy
1,Mallets that take a beating,"Great mallets! The aluminum handles make them super light, so you can drum harder for longer, and the felt tips on these are both solid and soft enough to use on a natural head drum-skin. I and many others got many nights of joy from the sound of these mallets on a 4ft diameter double-sided base drum in the middle of the woods. The dipped grips have the potential to make a slick grip when palms get sweaty, but not enough to even take off a single star. Very happy with the product. Thanks!"
1,Moving pictures represents the metal years,Rush's Moving Pictures represents the part of the golden era of Metal years. Crisp sounds and visual imagary keeps this album alive after many many years of music change.
0,"NOT ""The Last Days of Pompeii""!!!","This movie is NOT the ""Last Days of Pompeii"". I thought it would be a movie version of the Book. IT IS NOT!!The book is wonderful. This movie is trash compared to the book!! Why did they not make the movie follow the book???"
0,Muzak on Parade,"It was with much anticipation that I waited for this CD...the last big one for the millenium...unfortunatley I found very little to have been excited about. The music is bland, the lyrics are insincere romantic tragedy at it's worse...and of course this one might become popular in say, Europe...but then again, ""Let's Dance"" was an immensely popular album that shared in the lack of same substance ""Hours"" does. There are moments of brillaince throughout the CD, but they sound more like ""planned accidents"" than anything else. The final track, ""The Dreamers"" does leave one with hope though...hence, two stars. Save your money and start a savings account at bowiebanc.com...you'll probably get more of interest there."
1,intex airbed,I bought the intex airbed for my son who is staying with me for a few weeks. It inflates quickly and is very comfortable. It is a good mattress for extra guests
1,Excellent little stove/heater,"This fireplace/heater is loved by my in-laws. They are hard to buy for, so that alone means it's a great item to buy. They are enjoying the lovely flames at night with and without heat. It looks great and is small enough to put in any room if their furnace should go out. A great gift. I shipped it through True Value and they were also great at customer service."
1,Great for the flip.,I've used this iron for years. I love it. It works great for my straight hair when I want to flip up the ends.
0,EVER HEAR OF TREBLE?,"As previous reviews have pointed out the mix on this cd is absolutely horrible. The guitar is so muddy it's flat out annoying to listen to. Someone either didn't know there was a treble knob on the amp, tone knobs on the guitar or how to operate a mixing board. Go get Pat's early solo cd's like El Hombre or East; you can't go wrong with either one. Producers and engineers of today's jazz music could learn alot by picking up any of Rudy Van Gelders engineered Blue Note and Pretige recordings."
0,"Unintelligible rambling, relies on the reader's fears","If this is the way folks in the CIA write reports, the US would be wise to shut the operation down. Stream of consciousness ramblings has never been a successful way to communicate and get things done.The book presents a simplistic, misleading, or fictional version of the reality. The silly blacked out lines will offend the reader. The author's personal agenda seems to be anger at his relative poverty. There is all this money floating around the Middle East and he isn't sharing in the fun.The hysterical rants about oil corruption are hardly new, and fail to shed any insights upon human nature, American or Saudi."
1,Princess Blue Lapis and Sapphire Earrings,The Egyptian Princess Blue Lapis Lazuli and Dark Sapphire Sterling Silver Earrings are absolutely breathtaking. I have received compliments from people I know and complete strangers everytime I have them on. Your price was fantastic and the workmanship is nothing short of exceptional. Thanks once again Bling Jewelry.
0,BEWARE if you are in Denver/Boulder - no TV Guide listings,"I have owned this unit for nearly two years, have called customer support several times (they are friendly and fairly knowledgeable) and have never been able to use TV Guide listings because of an apparent incompatibility with Comcast's signal and this unit. Now, I can ""rent"" a DVR unit from Comcast that DOES work with their TV Guide signal (a Panasonic even!) but I dislike the idea of getting rid of this unit after investing a decent amount of $$ into it. If it weren't for this major problem, I'd be very happy with the unit."
0,Keep the Letterman gig!,"Okay, I gave it a shot - some funny bits but that's it. Writing a good novel is much different than writing JOKES for a comedy show. Maybe the Jewish comics(Sheft, Larry David, etc) have had their run after Seinfeld finished, let another group in!"
0,Revisionist History Which Affects the Music,"If CS/YI just sang love songs, maybe his politics would be irrelevant to the music. But he doesn't, so it is. Make no mistake, the VH1 and other mumble jumble he's spouted during the promotion for this record is a lot of hooey - he was asked time and time again to clarify his remarks after two book publishers were murdered for putting out Rushdie's book and he refused. Nor has he ever said he *disagrees* with what he was ""simply quoting."" How people can listen to a song like ""Peace Train"" or ""Wild World"" and force that from their minds is hard to understand, outside of nostalgia or historical interest... (By the way, anyone notice that everybody votes against the negative reviews no matter what they say or how they say it? Fire away!)"
1,GREAT PUBLICATION,This book is another of the many books that speak about the subject of prostitution. This book is rated highly for it's honesty in the field and its description of what occurs on an everyday basis. I give this book a high rating.
1,A good horror film with an ironic ending,This is a riviting film that has you guessing until the final sceen. Just the right thing for you horror buffs out there.
1,Exceptional,"Barbara opens the doors of her life, her heart, and her journey of faith and invites the reader to join her in these intimate sacred spaces. Anticipating Barbara's constant authenticity and abiding humor, this work of art is truly one of her best! It will delight and satisfy a variety of readers with a diversity of faith backgrounds. She shares in such a way though, that speaks directly to the hearts of the priests, clergy, and pastors who share in similar journeys of ordained life."
0,Digital Printmaking - out of date,This is no longer a good book. Its too out of date and is in serious need of a good overhaul. Look for something else.
1,Style of a Montell Jordan Sounds of a Keith Sweat.,"I heard the first five cuts and I said, ""This cat got what it takes to make it in the industry. Real smooth sound like a Kenny Lattimore. Really impressed with the way he let his music glide. The singing is ok, but the lyrics give yu something to think about when you are with a honey."
0,TOTAL disappointment :(,"Having read the whole series, I found this book a TOTAL disappointment. It was like taking a line from every book and making a movie of it. It was truly terrible. Read the books! They are TOTALLY amazing!... and I am in my late 30's.. never too old for these books!"
0,"A few good songs, but could have been better","Mostly remakes of their older songs, some of which are quite good. Only liked a few of the new ones, though. Just not one of their better albums."
0,Not quite strong enough,"Loved the idea, but the ball material was too soft and pliable and my lab mix ripped the ball apart in half a day. One day I will probably buy her another one but not put treats inside because she loved the ball itself."
0,Not what you might think!,"Looking at the description you may think this is a DVD. You would be wrong. When I ordered it I thought it might be an episode from the television series ""American Dreams"". It is actually an audio cd of patriotic songs. So unless you want toget all pumped up for the next 4th of July celebration forget it."
1,Invicta Diver Range,My 8932 @ Approx $48 is at this stage ( 21 days) really somethingand I have no reason to believe that it will not remain as such.Finish and quality is superb and equal to my Cat and Seiko watches.
0,"I'm a Daniel Silva fan, however this book,....?","...is simply awful. That is awful, not awesome. God, what a stinker.Technical details are shallow and/or missing, and the story is so laughable implausable, that for me being a Silva fan caused me to put this sad effort down and then return to it a half dozen times.It is where silly meets dumb and provide for the least interesting characters possible. I found that I was migrating towards minor characters like real estate agents and canines rather than the main and secondary protagonists.I am very glad that Mr.Silva's writing has improved in his later works. This one was, well,...painful.Worse. It was boring."
0,Dont buy,"Dont waste your money on this book,seriously. The only thing you need to know is Parasites. Yes, doctors dont want you to know about it, kind of obvious isnt it. Read educate yourself. Go to the web and search and find the best parasite cleanse called Dr. nature colonex. You wont be sorry, you will be amazed, and hopefully it will help you and your loved ones. Dont believe me , educate yourself."
0,Some good points but difficult to read...,"While this author has some good points and wisdom to share it is a very difficult read because it is horribly wordy. The author seems to go on and on and on about each topic/point. I found it very boring and difficult to read (and I love to read self-help books and have quite a collection of them). I think that the author should have either hired a ghost writer or the editor should have done a better job of cutting the wordiness out of the text. I finally started reading the summaries at the end of the chapters instead of the chapters itself. This had the potential to be a good book if it had been written in an easy read format. It would have been a much shorter book, though."

0,"This is really painful. I mean, torturous.","Echoing many remarks below, POOR, REALLY POOR, PITIFUL DIALOGUE. Where is the editor-type, anyway?'Da boys are meeting to review law school yearbooks to look for the villain's picture (because they have a hunch he went to law school, and a further hunch, because he's ""really smart,"" that he went to one of the top five law schools), when their pizza arrives. According to Meltzer, 'da boys ""turned their attention to the pizza."" I laughed so hard I almost spat up mine.If getting a book out is this easy, maybe I should start over, go to law school again, and write a novel rather than take the bar. Yeah, that's the ticket.I found myself finishing this book only because I felt guilty about wasting 25 bucks on it.Want real legal suspense? Read _A Civil Action_ by Jonathan Harr. Now that's a page-turner that you'll WANT to read all the way through."
1,Great device in it's time.,"When I first bought this 4 years ago, it cost me 499 bucks and was pretty darn amazing. Nowadays, it's showing it's age compared to the newer incarnations like the Archos 5 and 7, etc but this unit is built solidly, it's held up to abuse and the screen looks nice and bright and is durable. I still use mine from time to time, thought it's plagued with issues because the batteries for this thing last about a year before rapidly losing capacity. I've never had too much trouble with it locking up but if you save an HD MP4 file on it, it locks it up because it's trying to thumbnail the video. It's not meant for HD though, just DVD resolution files."
0,WEAK AND UNSAFE!,"I bought this gate because I have a huge doorway into my living room and this is the only one that would fit and still be able to swing open (not a metal, leave up gate)..... I got it in the mail, opened it up and it was all broken!! EIGHT (8) spindles were broken at the top. I called the company and they said that if I took it out of the box like that then it was a shipping issues. I told them the box was in PERFECT condition (because it was) and the lady said I still had to return it from the place I bought it because it was still a shipping issue! I will be returning this and NOT buying this gate again!!!!!!!!!!! The thing is EXTREMELY CHEAP and even if it was not broken when I got it I would not trust it!!! HORRIBLE PRODUCT!!!"
0,okay product but a little small,"I have a fairly large face and I found that the Neiko brand dust masks did not provide as much coverage as I would've liked. They were also a little on the flimsy side. I was recently using them while insulating my attic and after I started sweating, I constantly had to change my mask because once they got wet, they would collapse on my face. I guess it's good that 50 come in a box though."
1,Love it!,"I bought one of these machines nearly 20 years ago, and it is still going strong!! It has a few teeth marks from slow learners, but my dogs love it and it was totally worth the money!!"
1,Just what you'll need,"The 10-tool set is great! It's sturdy as all heck and good for adjusting almost any aspect of your bike on the fly.It's actually more useful for the allen wrench applications than the 17-tool version - because there are fewer tools, they take more space. This makes them longer, sturdier, and easier to handle. I've used both and prefer the 10-tool for simple adjustments."
0,Amateurish and Disappointing!,"The arms segment is the only one I've tried so far but it was horrible. I have to say this is the worst workout DVD of the twenty or so I own for a number of reasons:-The segments are billed as 20 minutes each, but according to my DVD timer, the arms segment only ran 15 minutes.-The workout was too easy. I didn't sweat, my heart rate didn't rise, and my arms didn't get sore. You don't use any weights.-The moves were hard to learn and there weren't verbal cues to tell you when to move to your left, right, etc.-The instructors are amateurish and their ""we're so cool"" banter is extremely annoying. They often missed steps. This seemed more like something someone would post on Youtube than a serious workout video.Save your money!"
1,A riviting tale of murder and intrigue.,"Obviously inspired by the real life case involving a mystery writer, this adventure packed journey of discovery will keep readers turning the pages as layer by layer a hideous past is exposed.Some of the things that happen are absurd but then again absurd happens."
0,Sorry,The game pieces are different characters that you put into a place holder and move them around the board. They are to big and tippy so the kids keep knocking them over. The orginal game had smaller more stable pieces. Very frustrating to try and keep track of where the pieces go. I liked that the new rules on the cards made the game different and quicker than the orignal.
0,Too technical for a new mom gift.,"I like to give new moms a book on how to photograph their children. I've purchased several different books covering this topic, this is the first one I'm not happy with. This book is far too technical for the use I need. There are much better options out there."
0,A completely waste of money,I have been using this for several weeks and the readings are not correct at all. I have taken it to my doctor and compare with his measurement: this device is completely wrong. DO NOT BUY IT. It is a completely waste of money.
0,Worked OK while they lasted.,"Sound is better than most stock earbuds, and they are very good at shutting out external noise. Takes a bit of work to get them sized up & fitted correctly, and after that it still takes a while to get used to them. If you get them fitted in your ears just right, they have good frequency range for earbuds, but if you don't, the sound quality seriously suffers.Would have been happy enough with them but after about six months, sound from the left earbud failed. Got them pretty cheap so it's hardly worth it to try to RMA them, even if they are still under warranty. I have the HD580 and HD560 Sennheiser headphones and the sound on those is fantastic and they will last forever. A big reason why I bought these is because I thought I'd get the same sort of quality in these earbuds. It's disappointing to see Sennheiser put their name on an unreliable product."
0,Too Much Praise,"There are some excellent stories in this book, but I enjoyed the Best Bisexual Erotica series by Carol Queen much more. Perhaps it is my own taste. I think there are too many rave reviews about this book to warrant that it is THE VERY BEST. It is good but my socks weren't knocked off. Best Bisexual Erotica knocked my socks off, my shirt off, my skirt off, all my clothes off. ;-)"
1,Very Needed Info,Robert Kiyosaki is giving life saving information. I learned so much from this book.
0,Do not waste your money,"My daughter loves Barbie and was so excited to receive this game. It was very sad to see how quickly she became frustrated with it's poor,poor design. The movement is difficult to control, the games are sometimes impossible and the graphics orient themselves in such a strange way that it is almost impossible to complete the games without falling off of something and having to start over.Please save your money and do not buy this product. It isn't worth one dollar let alone the nearly thirty that they have set as a price."
1,Living Chess,"What makes Life and Death in Shanghai so captivating is the seemingly unlimited thought put into its writing. Since Nieng Cheng's quick and cunning analytical thinking was her only available weapon of self-defense, she spared neither time nor effort in analyzing every minute detail of her surroundings. Cheng's conversations with her interrogators at the detention house resembled a real-life chess game played between two grand masters. Both parties spent days, weeks, or even months formulating a defensive and offensive strategy. Life and Death in Shanghai leads the reader though a plethora of original logical thoughts and conclusions, not unlike the deductions of Sherlock Holmes, which give the story an almost fictional feel. This book will be of interest to both casual and critical readers. Highly recommended."
0,SAVE YOUR $$$$$$,I played this game at my friends house and I thought that it was pretty boreing. First of all the game play isn't good at all . I thought the graphics were good. The game play is like Socom but set in the future. The should have a couple more and better weapons. The rounds are stupid because when your the last one alive on your team you lose which is stupid because your still alive against say two more droids and you lose. I was going to buy it at first but when I played it at my friends house I thought h*** no.But thats my opinion for this game. If you like it thats fine
0,Keep the tools handy to retighten,"The chairs assemble easily enough (they come in 3 parts - the seat, the front legs and the back legs) - however, beware that the bolts come loose way too easily and you'll need to keep the tool handy to retighten them often. I may get out some Gorilla Glue (wonderful stuff once it foams and dries) to strengthen the structure of the chairs."
1,Rare Find for a Self Help Book,"In my life, I must have read hundreds of self help books. This is one of the very best.It is succinct, well written, and to the point. It has questions at the end of most chapters.It also has lists of things to keep in mind while reflecting on one's self and one'srelationships."
1,Vintage Zoot,Beautiful! Like having your back rubbed. The combination of Jimmy Rowles and Zoot is magic. The downside on this CD is that it's only 44 minutes long.
1,What a Wonderful Item,"I am thrilled that I was able to purchase this labeler. I have been trying to get one for a while. It would be on sale somewhere and once I got there the store would be sold out. When I did see it on sale again somewhere else it wasn't the same kind of sale. So I decided to go on Amazon.com to see if anyone was selling it and this seller was and brand new, for the same price I was trying to buy it at. Thank you so much the opportunity. I recommend this seller."

0,SAS Survival Guide - SMALL pocket version,"Be Advised. IT IS A VERY SMALL BOOK and so is the print inside! Please Please Review the pictures before buying this version of this book.Although this small one may be easy to carry in a pocket or a pack during camping or Bug Out. For general everyday use and educational reading, the LARGER version of this book which AMAZON sells will be MUCH more enjoyable and useful. You'll be a lot happier!!!!I urge caution! Buy a magnifying glass along with this small book."
1,"Whatever they just smoked, stay clear of it!","This group is the result of what happens when you take one too many night time pain relievers. This group would have been better suited having existed in the late sixties but hey, for the sake of all us youngsters, I'm glad they are around in my day and age.Urban Hymns is a solid cd based on drugs, psychodelic paranoia, and a free lifestyle. Although I'm hardly a drug user, I still found the songs to be very good road trip anthems. It's nicely crafted, with Bitter Sweet Symphony taking on the role of ""catchy song."" If you like Oasis or Coldplay(both from the UK), this is your next stop on the road to music satisfaction.BEWARE: Bitter Sweet Symphony is only one of about three songs that's background music if electronic on this cd. Most of the songs are accustic."
1,Clears Head Colds and Congestion,I have used this product for years to help clear the congestion associated with head colds and upper respiratory congestion. A few drops in a hot bath is all it takes and breathe deeply. Another use is a drop or two on a hanky or pllow case. This product is safest when it is diluted and not used at full stregnth on the skin.
1,"melancholic, kick-ass Southern boys","I browsed through some of the previous reviews, and frankly, I can't understand the comparisons with the Strokes. These bands aren't even remotely similar, other than the fact that they reside outside of the mainstream (thank God).That said, I highly recommend this album if you like intelligent, bittersweet rock'n'roll from Dixie like the Allman Brothers, Lynyrd Skynyrd, or newer bands like the Drive By Truckers, My Morning Jacket, and Black Crowes. That's not to say that Kings of Leon sounds much like any of these bands, just that they have a similar attitude towards life & faintly similar musical styles. Perhaps what they all have in common is the ability to smoothly change song dynamics, from an acoustic-driven, bittersweet song (or part of a song) to frenzied rock.I also love the singer's voice (whichever Followill brother is singing, pardon my ignorance), particularly when he screeches and raves like a madman. It's what rock'n'roll is all about."
1,You just blew my mind,"This CD is amazing, pure and simple. I bought it on a whim after I heard the song ""Outlined In Black"", but let me tell you -- this thing is unbelievable from start to finish. Brutally heavy and thrashy, Ghouls of Grandeur is one of the best metal albums that was released in 2003. Also, if you like this check out ""First Round Knockout"" by Deride -- its very similar to this.PS Metal fans -- have a sense of humor and give Fred Dursts Numba One Fann a break. Its a joke."
1,Very fun movie,"It's better than MIB2, i think. Josh Brlolin plays an excellent young Agent K.It was pretty cool how the film maker connected K's past and J's past."
0,really bad,these are really soft and ride nice until you use the brake because they get flat spots in them. this happened to me the 2nd day i had them. dont waste your money!
1,"Great, no complaints.","Great copy, no complaints here. Smooth as can be, no nicks, came in a timely fashion. Missed this game something fierce."
0,Wrong size,The ladies 9.5-11 size was way too big. It would fit was a man's size 11 shoe. The Tingley rubbers was correctly sized.
1,Functional and colorful,"These are great box bottom file folders. Yes, you have to put in the cardboard piece that fits into the bottom of the file, but that takes very little work. The colors are already collated, so you don't have to do that bit of work. These files seem very sturdy and the card stock they are made of seems like they should last a long time.I prefer different colored file folders for a few reasons. Sometimes I remember what color the file is and with all of the files and junk in my drawer it isn't easy to find. So I look for the color and the tab to try and find my file. Also different colored files can prevent filing something in the wrong file by accident, which is when things get lost forever! If you have some files with a lot of paperwork, this is the way to go. The papers sit nicer in the file and it is easier to dig through your file when it's not all smashed together."
0,NOTHING like the book!,"Brian Greene has no greater fan (except maybe his mother), and his magnificent book The Elegant Universe is phenomenal. I expected this tape to discuss some of the perplexing issues relating to superstring and M theory. Instead I ended up with something made to appeal to grade school children--lot's of goofy special effects and only the most cursory treatment of the subject. If you expect to learn anything from this video, you'll be bitterly disappointed. The only reason I gave it even one star was because it was nice to actually see and hear the author--a truly brilliant scientist who possesses the rare gift of illuminating complex subjects for the general public. Get the book instead. After you read The Elegant Universe, get his next book, The Fabric of the Cosmos. Forget about this ridiculous, juvenile video. (I do not mean to be nasty--just want to spare other people from the cost and disappointment of this video.)"
0,NOT the complete Brandenburgs!,"I've never listened to this CD, so please forgive me for butting in and giving this product a low rating, but...I just want folks to be aware of something before they take the plunge here. I have no desire to cast aspersions on Susan Lautenburg, the fine violinist featured on this recording. My 2 Star rating has nothing to do with Lautenburg or her group but everything to do with marketing and packaging. These are NOT the complete Brandenburg Concertos, no matter what the previous reviewer thinks. Concertos 2, 3, 4 & 5 are each missing 1 or 2 entire movements.Also, despite what this person says, Glenn Gould never conducted or played on any recorded version of the Brandenburgs, let alone one with poor sound quality."
1,Very Good Game,If your a fan of the Diablo or Baldurs Gate series then you should do yourself a favor and check out Dungeon Siege. This game is basically a cross between Diablo and Baldurs Gate and incorporates features from both games. This game adds new twists on the RPG genre when in that in most RPG's you choose whatever class you want to be from the start and cannot change. In Dungeon Siege this is not so. Your skills and classare determind by how you play.My favorite feature of the game is the fact that once you are inside the game world you do not have to load additional levels. Gone are the loading between levels of Diablo and the disc swapping of Baldurs gate. This is a very good game and one that you will not regret buying.
0,"Works well, but cheap switch fails","I have purchased 5 of these detectors for my employees who are home inspectors. While the detector is accurate, the dial which functions as an on-off/volume switch is cheap. The dial's wheel is easily stripped. We have replaced these with more durable testers."
0,Thanks every other reviewer...,"just caught the movie on late night tv, loved two songs at the closing credits, came straight on to Amazon to buy the soundtrack. i would have wasted my money if not for the very imformative reviews here. Two songs i wanted, 1 has been mutilated by some holier-than-thou idiots, and the other isn't even featured on the cd. Disgraceful. Thanks for the reviews. I'm off to look up 'The Old 97's' now, and already being a Dan Baird, fan i will be buying 'The Yahoos' cd. Thanks for saving me money and disappointment. cheers. Rob."
1,Romantic CD,"The ""Hope Floats"" soundtrack is a very soothing and romantic CD. It's great listening to while relaxing. There's a variety of Artists and some really fun songs!"
0,Overrated,"This is my nomination for the most overrated CD of 2002. It's a terribly weak follow up to the fun, original, and different album that was Country Grammar. In the old CD, Nelly tried new things and experimented with bass in ways other rappers hadn't. He stood out from the crowd - but in his latest release, he seems to have sold out to produce a mediocre effort, which sounds exactly like the product of every other black guy with a microphone who's told he has ""talent"". I'm sorry Nelly, but your new CD just doesn't stack up to the original. Try again.1/5 stars"
1,The only long lasting toy,"I have two cats and this is the only toy they didn't give up on after a few days. It's also the only cardboard, or other material, ""scratching"" item that keeps them from clawing the furniture.The Turbo Scratcher lasted the longest as far as keeping their interest. I just have to remember to put it away at bedtime or I hear the ball rolling around all night!"
0,Not as good as I remember...,"Sadly, I must agree with the majority of reviewers. This series does not translate well. It lacks focus in its directing, tension in its writing and the picture quality is rather poor. Too bad, as it is from 1959. Fonda must have indeed needed the money and it was, as was written, ""an easy gig"" for him. Nice performance by Allen Case, who sadly never did much more on screen, but did have his moments on(off?) Broadway and unfortunately died in his fifties of a heart-attack. And Robert Redford has a nice guest spot in one episode, but still it is not worth the asking price. Incidentally, I bought my set for $19.99 from a local retailer. So $31.99 is definitely out of line!How about a set of Bat Masterson?! And this time re-master it!!!"
0,The Confessions of St. Augustine,Written in a way making understanding difficult. This could have been translated in a more interesting and reader friendly manner. Very disappointing.

0,Disappointed and disillusioned,I purchased this set just under a year ago from Kmart and it worked great up until a couples months ago. I recently got cable service and so had to hook the tv up to the cable box; that night I noticed a high pitched humming noise and realized it was coming from the tv. Two days after hooking up the set the remote controls (both for the cable - which was now programmed to control the tv - and the original tv control) no longer turned the set on immediately. I now have to stand there and press that ON button at least 15 times before the set actually turns on. I disconnected the set from the cable and unplugged it for an entire day hoping it would reset itself but to no avail. The set still humms incessantly when turned off and takes an eternity to turn on. I HATE THIS TV. Olevia's customer service sucks. Their idea of offering advice is to tell me to try pluggin it into another outlet...which I'd already tried and it FAILED.
0,Chopin,Disappointed in the whole movie. The storyline felt very fragmented to me. Not a favorite of mine.
1,Squared away.,"Someone is not playing with a full deck. Honor Harrington obviously is inspired by Horatio Hornblower (a character created by C. S. Forestor (sp?). But Horatio came on as ""Mr Midshipman Hornblower"" Whereas Honor was introduced to us as a full commander who came on as already educated and squared away. Honor loosely follows Horatio but both are great fictional characters and ""The Honor of the Queen"" will back me up on that. Weber has the ability to make one believe the hardware is feasible and all of us would love to have the skill and courage displayed by Honor and many of her accompanying characters, both good guys and bad guys."
0,Cave of Forgotten Dreams,"What a strange movie! It started out as a factual documentary which I found absolutely fascinating especially since I had never heard of the cave before even though it's a relatively recent find. The drawings are wonderful to see! Then it turned very peculiar. It's even hard to describe. It's some kind of French new-age speculation about modern mankind connecting with prehistoric artists through these drawings which are ""actually"" dreams. Was interesting but not worth the money."
1,I don't think you can find a better one,"With a paring knife, I want a slightly flexible blade, but one that will hold an edge. And it needs to fit my hand. This one does it all, so well that I now have four of them so one is always on the ready."
1,Zimbo,OK i was looking forward to this game and when it came out i was playing on x box live and i herd some mixed feelings about it so rather then buyingit i rented it and man was i glad i did that. THis game you cant even jump in how is that realalistic and the guns my god are so unproportional. THe graphics are ok better then some but the animation or graphics on certain objects is horrible. I reommend that if you are looking for a good Online game for X-Box get Counter-Strike there is a good game and the graphics are good but that dosent matter gameplay rocks better then soldier of fortune and add's a new twist to theses first person shooters and scoreboards makes people try harder so go out by counterstriek my friends
1,Buy it here,Definitely an attractive price vs buying at the vet and the large size insures you'll have it for a while. My dog actually enjoys these tablets and the results are noticable.
0,"Despite the good cause, do not buy this for small children .","This book is a retelling of the classic story by a few dozen celebrities writing and performing (on the CD that comes with it)the parts of the various characters in the book. I was not at all happy to find that a book that is certainly meant for small children contains much that I found inappropriate for my 4 year old and even my 8 year old. This collaboration turns out to be an opportunity for some well meaning, but clueless, celebrities to entertain and impress each other. Many of the characters are needlessly mean spirited and vulgar. Between the 'potty' humor of Robin Williams to the use of the term 'schmuck' by Fran Drescher there is plenty to make me put this book/CD in the trash. There were several classy and thoughtful contibutions including those from Angela Lansbury and Nathan Lane, but this was not enough to make up for the other shortcomings.If you like the cause send in the $30 and tell them to keep the book and the CD."
0,Not all it should be,"This toy is a great concept, but it has too many problems, especially in light of the price. In addition to inconsisentcy with the scanner (and no mention of light issues in the instruction manual), the screeching of plastic rubbing against plastic on the drawer, both which have been mentioned, my unit says &quot;sheven&quot; instead of seven, and eggsh instead of eggs. My daughter is oblivious to these problems and loves it."
1,Something important to know.....,".....When reading RAW's works.In a letter to me back in 1977, Mr. Wilson said that he writes ""Mostly other people's opinions"" in his books.I believe it's important to know that if one is tempted to criticize his point of view. It usually isn't.Entertaining though, isn't he?"

0,Depends on who you are,"If you are a plaintiff's attorney or really really stupid this book will appeal to you. It is a self-serving collection of lies, micharacterizations, and falsehoods financed by the ATLA in hopes that gullible voters will take their word for everything that is said. Similar to any Michael Moore film, this book puts its hands over its ears and screams CORPORATIONS, CORPORATIONS, CORPORATIONS!!! at the top of its lungs, expecting that the average reader will agree with its communist leanings and denounce the pigs who place safety before profits.All in all, a waste of time and money."
1,Dainty,"The bracelet is dainty, sturdy, and beautiful. It represents myself as a person and i don't ever take it off."
1,Oh man....,"this album is cool. How shall I explain this album. It is filled with pop songs that mostly sound the same from each other but are stripped down until they are nothing but vocals, a guitar onslaught, and amazing, amazing white noise. This album even goes further with The Velvet Underground's ideas that they founded and makes it a bit more glossier and beautiful. You can slightly sense more of The Velvet Underground with the lyrics, they are both dark and about drugs and dying. But it isn't completely devoid of songs with cheer in them. The album starts out with the amazing Just Like Honey and this sort set the playbook for the rest of the album. This album is practically flawless and you should buy this and let is set in, and you won't be let down at all, if it hits you right it will become one of your favorite albums."
1,Simply Fantastic,"This bike is amazing. For the price i don't think i could find a better road bike. I bought myself the blue 22.5 inch bike and I love it. I am 5'7"" and the bike fits me fine but i would go with the small frame if you are any shorter than 5'7"". My bike came 5 days after I ordered it. I have never assembled a bike before and I put this beauty together in less than a half hour, it was more simple than putting together small grill i just bought. I bought this bike for exercise and just got back from a 20 mile ride feeling great. I highly recommend this bike."
1,An album never to tire of.,"This mix is one of the most energetic and soulful recordings i have heard of Fatboy Slim, or any Electronica artist for that matter. Packed with thick beats and creative samples that seem made for each other, this set offers the most creative dance work in years."
0,Incompatible,"Using Windows XP PC and HP Laserjet 1200 to set it up-The instructions in the box are very incomplete. Several additional steps are needed to set it up, and it doesn't tell you how to get wireless access. I spent an hour on the phone with tech support, half an hour of which was on hold. Linksys tech support came to the conclusion that I need to call Hewlett Packard tech support, which is absurd. I could print test pages from my PC, but not documents, so there was communication between the devices but they could not help me figure out what was wrong. I think it will eventually work, but there are a ton of problems to deal with in setup."
1,"Full of integrity and heart, so much better than I expected!","Although I've always enjoyed watching Joaquin Phoenix and John Travolta onscreen(two of the main actors in this movie), I didn't have high hopes for the movie itself. Ater 9/11, I honestly thought the director would try to gloss up firefighting and veer away from the hard realities, sacrifices and sheer courage required by those men who choose to stay the course, day in and day out.Instead, this movie had integrity, heart and, just as importantly, a riveting story. Told from the perspective of a rookie firefigher and his captain, it careened from one exciting moment to the next but also showed the toll firefighting can take on marriages and personal lives. I was often moved to tears and the teenagers who saw it with me were riveted and inspired. We need more movies like this."
1,Save Dead Like Me...,"Dead Like Me has been one of the best shows i've seen for ages.

1,Blue-tiful,"This is guaranteed to be one of the top sellers over the '08 holiday season, as all music lovers will appreciate the quality and content of this package. The book is gorgeous, and includes the original contact sheets from the recording sessions with Coltrane, Davis, and other players. Let's not forget the blue vinyl! Not only is it pretty, but sounds great. If you're looking for the perfect ""something"" for any music lover, this is it. Hands down."

Whether your child/teen is drug addicted, sexually active, or a truant, thisbook gives simple to follow guidance on dealing with these tough issues. Irecommend it highly to anyone who feels they no longer have control of their kids or home. It works"
0,"Quick, Simple Read","This book is very elegantly and eloquently written. As beautiful as the words are used in this book, I somehow failed to develop an emotional attachment to the characters. I read this book in 4 days, and was unfortunately tired of reading it and was not disappointed when it was done. I was not enthralled by this book. I must say though, I truly appreciate the author's fluid use of words and let the words flow through me as I read it, but honestly, after reading all of the reviews on the book jacket of this book, I was disappointed that as an avid reader of quality literature, I did not find this book to be as good as the many reviews."
0,"Poor, Poor Ms. Kelsey","Let me start out by stating this --- I am from South Dakota. And while I hate to disillusion the poor readers who've previously bought this book before reading this review, I must say we do not speak the way the author would like us to (as this would make for a less interesting story). I feel that if the author WAS indeed ostracized, her attitude about South Dakotans must've shown through in her interactions with us. I saw this book as nothing but a running rant on the citizens of our state, while begging for a pity party. I was hard-pressed to find three consecutive sentences that didn't contain a barb toward her hometown. The author does at times laugh at herself. But probably not nearly as often as the townspeople laughed at the author. Now that she's written the book and gotten all of her frustration out, I hope the author can live here in peace. But I doubt it. We are, after all, able to read."
1,"Product Great, Packaging Not So Much","The product is fantastic! Mixed in a shaker bottle, it dissolves well, taste good, and doesn't upset my stomach.My only complaint is that the packaging was misrepresented. Instead of the container shown, the powder was shipped in a ""resealable"" bag and the re-sealable strip did not work properly. I had to get a tupperware-type container for storing it in -- not the end of the world, but it was not expected either."
0,lies and poor customer service,"Yes, I ordered two pairs of socks, says here; but in the end, I only received one pair. Perhaps I should take partial responsibility for not returning the purchase or spending a half hour on the phone to speak a complaint with someone, given that this company didn't respond to my email complaint... I thought I was getting deal, but $10 for a pair of socks ain't so cheap."

0,It's quit working - Unreliable,"This thing worked for a while but now it is acting very strangely. I tried to get information from Polder online and found no supporting documentation. My guess is that the probe is the problem, but a replacement probe is $20 and a new complete unit is $25. I guess I will fall back on the old reliable analog manual stick-in-the-meat thermometer and trash the Polder."
0,In 20 years Lewis would learn to write well.,"I bought this book because I'd read Lewis' ""The Big Short: Inside the Domesday machine"" and was impressed by the author. But ""Liar's Poker"" is juvenile by comparison. It's not about what happened in the financial markets but rather about classroom hi-jinks and trading floor pranks. Who cares? I got 40% into the book and gave up."

1,A decent cd.,"I got this album 2 days ago. After hearing the hit song 'Devil Inside' a year ago on the tv, I decided to get the whole album. The songs were okay. Its just that 'Devil Inside'is the main reson I got the album. I don't know much about Utada, but I think she is a great artist. I plan on getting some more of her albums, including the recently released 'Ultra Blue', which seems to be her best album to date, according to viewers. Utada, keep doing what u are good at and don't let the haters get in your way!"
0,It's not EC...,"I was hoping to hear EC doing some of great works on the Strat or His Gibson J-45 or maybe even His Signiture Martin But NOPE. It's just a bunch of Studio or Session Musicians doing Cover's of EC's work. If You enjoy just good Music and don't mind that it not the Artist Themself's then this is a nice CD. Buy It, You'll love it, But if Your like Me, I want the Real Artist playing their Music. I'm a big Eric Clapton and back in the 70's when I was a Studio Musician, I got to sit in and Play with Him so to Me if it's not EC, I'm just not in to it."
1,Take a Safari from your living room,"Yes I'm biased. I was fortunate enough to go on a David Anderson safari and to have the honor of having a photo published in this book.Even if I wasn't personally biased, this book is a beautiful asset for your home. Especially for nature and animal lovers, there are hundreds of photos in this book that are absolutely breathtaking. On Safari also gives tips and guidance to those interested in taking the adventure of a lifetime through a safari.Buy it!Worth every penny!"
1,3.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A slick, urban revenge thriller that takes a little time to establish characters and is all the better for it, Four Brothers makes good use of Chiwetel Ejifor as a villain and Detroit as a setting; if you like a little light comedy alongside stellar car chases and shootouts, this is the movie for you."
1,Great EBM album!,"Terrance Fixmer and Douglas McCarthy are two names synonymous with electronic music. Fixmer is a well known Techno artist whose releases sell out in stores faster than they can be ordered, and McCarthy was the front man in the Industrial/EBM pioneer band Nitzer Ebb. To say that when these two got together to do electronic music it would be incredible is a violent understatement. With their combined musical knowledge, Fixmer/McCarthy are poised to unleash their electronic assault on the unsuspecting masses. Corrosive, explosive beats, infectious sequences, and aggressive melodies are sure to disintegrate any dance floor.Buy or die:)"
1,Fantastic!,"I stayed up past midnight reading this book a few times because I didn't even care about being tired, I just wanted to read!!Drizzt is developed very well in this book, and becomes even more impossibly cool than before. Definitely one of my new favorite books."

I believe it should work, but I just got a bad one. I have talked to and emailed bestop but so far no help for the bad door."
0,All frills and fluff,This book is very lighthearted. The information is not groundbreaking so don't expect to read this book and become some kind of seductress.
0,not worth the money,We boought this white mountain 6 quart freezer for our lake property. Used it 2 times and the motor went bad. New motor costs $149.00. To expensive to replace so we junked it and bought a least expensive ice cream maker. It works so much better than the Ice Mountain did. Would definetly not recomend this to anybody.
0,Overpriced Garbage,"Cheap, plastic, non-refillable, and the safety button on mine broke after light use, rendering the lighter inoperable. You can purchase better lighters for $3-5."
1,Great Movie!,I loved this movie. It was very sweet. George (Hugh) and Lucy (Sandra) were perfect for each other. I laughed a lot during Two Weeks Notice. This is the best romantic comedy I've seen since Sweet Home Alabama.
0,Not for play in the USA,I bought this series in the US from a US seller but this set is for play in the EU. It is useless for me.
0,Gory for shock value...,"I started this book when it was chosen for my book club. I tried to keep an open mind, however after the first two chapters, I could not convince myself to pick it back up.I found that while some of the historical context information behind the use of cadavers for medical training was interesting, some of the imagery she used was gory beyond what was needed to make her point-- perhaps looking for shock value.My only comment upon reading the opening of the book was... why continue? For those with an honest interest in this topic it may be a fine overview, but I found her mix of humor with explicit detail less than a good match, and her level of detail disturbing and pointless."
1,This is the steak of studies in Jesus,This book will propelled you into a different level of love and fear(awe) of God. You will be regenerated with a new found love of the Old Testament and Torah. The exactness of God is profoundly evident when looking at the scriptures in the context of the language and idioms of Israel. This book has prepared and compelled me to start new study groups. Without the insight of Joseph Good's book I feel I was blind.

1,Great Little SUV for your dollhouse family!,I was really excited to find this SUV for my daughter to go along with her Twin Time Dollhouse for Christmas last year. She loves it and plays with it a lot. This is a very cute and sturdy addition to the dollhouse.
1,"The Chunga's Revenge disc is ""Classical"".",My opinion about Chunga's Revenge Disc is a Classical Based on Blues and others ways if Zappa knows. I like much this disc.
0,Not a good solution for angry children,"This book does not provide a realistic scenario for helping children and the adults in their lives deal with anger. The situation was a typical sequence for a child getting really angry. But who would let their young child out to roam that far (even in make believe) when they are so upset? This option is not a safe, satisfying or rectifying option for angry children. Indeed, the underlying message is ""Go away if you're upset, we don't want you around here!"" I would love to see this storyline suggest that a parent (or significant adult) will help by trying to understand the child, help the child feel calm again, and show the child ways to gracefully recover from intense emotions."
0,"If you want to learn Islam, then these shouldn't be the book","I have just read the description of the book, even that is nonsense. I am neither arab nor jew, but I am a muslim. Ask the guy who wrote this book when Ottoman was ruling the Palestine. Weren't they muslims? The Ottomans 500 years ago has saved the jews from the massacre. If they were muslims than according to this book, they shouldn't have done that. If you are really looking for true knowledge, then do not seek it in such a book full of hatred and definitely biased. This book is just for those who want to put their head in the sand, and believe what they already have. Love the created, because of the creator. That's why Ottoman saved who needed refuge."
0,No QIF Import - Don't waste your money,"Be warned! Quicken 2006 doesn't support QIF import. I know (now) that this shortsighted business decision started with Quicken 2005 but I'm still hopping mad about it. Intuit decided that they wanted to extract more of their exorbitant OFX licensing fees from financial institutions by eliminating QIF import support. Some financial institutions in turn pass these fees directly on to the customer.I don't really care how many new bells and whistles Quicken 2006 has. It doesn't perform a fundamental function that financial software should be capable of doing: importing standard online statement file formats. Without this capability, Quicken is a complete waste of money."
1,Caveman Politics is a cult classic from a great talent,"Jay Atkinson is a gem in the rough, a writer who has penned a book which uses sport to uncover and illuminate the human condition. The story of Joe Dolan's brush with salvation is our story... as we hurl ourselves through the confusion of life. If this talented storyteller doesn't shake up the literary world for years to come, then publishing really has gone over to the dark side."
1,Excellent!,"I missed the first couple episodes of the first season and couldn't wait for it to become available on DVD. Excellent acting, excellent story. I can't wait for season 2!"
1,"Bob Yamtich, so hot right now.","Okay, so I'm horribly sorry to disagree with you, Ms. Snyder--but I just LOVED Confessions. I think that it was an incredible insight into meaningful sexuality AND high school pregnancy scares that I could not have coped with otherwise. Bob's book gave me the stregnth to get through my ordeal and I rejoice knowing that individuals everywhere have Bob's delightful words to turn to in their own confusion and time of need. BUY THIS BOOK. Saying it changed my life would be an understatement...."

Waris' recollection of her life in the desert was especially interesting, though at times shocking and sad."

0,good idea but . . .,"This movie had promise in the beginning. Unfortunately Ethan Hawke was surrounded by characters that couldn't keep up. Even Willam DeFoe fell flat. Special effects were ok but it seems like the movie production ran out of money and certain scenes got the budget treatment while others didn't. Lastly, were the sponsors of this movie Chrysler and Marlboro because there seemed to be a good chunk of time spent on filming the car as well as everyone smoking. I don't care so much about the smoking but it seemed almost over the top, like Johnny Depp in the Ninth Gate. 1.99 would have been a fair price but 3.99 was too much. More and more these days I find myself content to wait for movies to be available for streaming on netflix."
1,And the winner is....,"Really- it sounds like a plain boring book- but it's not! No, From original stories like Clever Gretchen to Twisted ones like the sleeping prince or Mollie Whippie- it had all that and a bag of potatoes. My favourite was Kate Crackernuts. Then came the Sleeping Prince, next Manka and the Judge.All of the tales are of strong women who outwit, set straight, and save the ""Man's"" world from GIANTS,bugurlers,enchanted sleeps (what did you think the sleeping prince was about?) and other horrible creatures.THis book is a must- but you might understand the wording a little better if you're a pre-teen or teenager.Enjoy it, I did!"

1,Early California Counter-culture,"John Steinbeck was an American classic. His two seminal books, East of Eden and Grapes of Wrath are, in my opinion, both on the top 10 list of American fiction. But readers would be making a big mistake to stop reading Steinbeck with those two novels. The author with this, his breakout book, shows the tremendous breadth of his abilities. This book could be read as pure escapism with a loveable group of unreliable scoundrels. It could also be seen as an early example of beat writers, albeit with a slower pace. But it belongs on all American fiction lovers shelves. It is one of those reads that will stay in most readers hearts and souls."

1,Highly recommended,"This book is great anathema to the (relatively) recent, more popular (and false) ""tabala rasa"" view of human nature. He documents many instances of how human cultures converge across the board, although I would say the book is far from ground-breaking. Rather it demonstrates just how far much of psychological and socialogical science has gone off the rails. Some of the most interesting examples are from human language. He, Steven Pinker and Noam Chomsky should collaborate..."
1,Easily misunderstood but groundbreaking,"This book is written for scholars of political science, not for casual readers or the anti-establishment. Claes Ryn describes a movement throughout Western politics that he calls the neo-Jacobins. The neo-Jacobins bear a resemblance to Rousseau in the sense that (1) they advocate the eradication of tradition and political and individual restraint, (2) their morality is such that they are always right, and anyone who opposes them is wrong. Neo-Jacobin thinking permeates through intellectual elites who stand to gain power from the two points above. The one criticism I have is that his description of the Jacobins may not be taken seriously because it comes across as a ""conspiracy."" In fact, it is not a conspiracy, and many of the Jacobins are not aware that they are or have not thought carefully about where they stand. Still, such a manner of presentation may discourage serious readers from accepting his views."

I've already recommended the flashlights to many family members and friends."
1,Fullmetal for the year!,"I recently received this calendar from amazon.The colors and detail are just as excellent as they are in the show. I saw a few memories from earlier in the show, plus a few things that may have been hinted at for later.Most cover the boy's journeys from the time they left home, to thier current whereabouts on their way to become ""normal"" again.People they meet along the way are there as well, Friends and Rivals alike. There are a few scenes which show that even though they are ""Orphans"" they do actually have a rather large Family.Some of the Graphical humor from the show is there as well, ED and Winry with her usual way of getting his attention (Wrench).All in All I am very glad I did not pass this one up. I will be able to get my Fullmetal fix All throughout the year. (Oh yeah, I will also have a calandar so I know what day it is).RDW"
1,Evidence not seen shows faith at work,"Read the story of a modern day woman who lived out what she believed and was an example of what it means to really know God and trust Him. It is a challenge and an encouragement at the same time!

1,quite suprised,"I like many other people that bought this album were expecting a bunch of SNAP music. i like the song ""do it to it"" dont get me wrong but i thought this album would be a CD full of songs just like that but suprisingly there are some songs on there that will appeal to grown folks as well. let me say that after a single that did not get much air time(miss p) and a shelved album in 2003 i didnt think wed ever see these girls again but they found their luck with jazzy pha. they have the style of girls their age but @ the same time they have the sophistication to draw attention from the more mature crowd.younger crowd-----------------that boiDO IT TO ITchevytakenchick like meolder crowd----------fool for youunappreaciatedstop calling meoohshow and tellmoment in time(love this track, their vocals sound soo good together)whenever(another one of my favorites on the album.. makes you feel like u back in the 90s listeing to a TLC album)"

1,Dark Classic,This is a very good metal album.These were the days when Metallica had an Iron Maiden vibe about them and this shows on the title track and 'Creeping Death'. When you listen to the load album you can only stare at your stereo in disbelief comparing it to this.'Fade to Black' is a magnificent song- Metallica's first acoustic song.'For Whom The Bell Tolls'is my personel fav on the album with its thundering bass lines courtesy of the brilliant Cliff Burton and the song's poetic lyrics.I would say it is Metallica's darkest album whilst it does not have quite the same conviction and complexity as the subseqeunt 'Master of Puppets'.'The Call of Ktulu' is a genius instrumental to close the album- an eight minute epic if ever there was one.Yep it don't get much better than this.
1,Lengthy but good.,"A very long and in depth book on Japanese cooking. But if you want to truly learn about the origins of why and how things are done, it is a must have. This is not your basic take off the shelf and look up a recipe cook book. It is a cook book/history book."

1,Not like the live stuff from her Web site,"If you like Rickie Lee, make sure you visit her web site whereshe sells MP3 live recordings, direct to you. There you willfind the opposite of this one: quieter, looser, quirkier. Theofferings there (www.rickieleejones.com) are also often completeshows. This one *is* as the other reviews suggest: (high-)powered, poppy, punchy. The thing is, I don't know Rickie Leeand neither do you (and neither do these other reviewers). Sowho can comment on her wishes, and who knows but what she wantsall of these sides of her performance persona exposed. In thisperformance, she took pains to put together a *very* slick band,complete with muted trumpet ornaments, multi-part harmonies,etc. And it rocks. And if you feel like complaining about theslick production, save your breath and your time, go to herwebsite, and download the quiet sensitive stuff until yourfingers go numb. That stuff is great, too!"

0,Iron Yoga,"I have to be honest, I've only used this DVD twice. I found it to be very boring and unmotivating. It wasn't a good strength workout and it wasn't a good yoga workout. They tried to combine the two and it didn't work for me. When I do yoga I feel a sense of well-being and my body feels like it has benefitted from head to toe. This didn't give me that feeling at all! When I lift weights, I can definately feel that I have accomplished something and my muscles are fatigued. This video didn't do that for me either. Maybe it works for some people, but I didn't enjoy it. Also, I think you have to be careful in some of the poses with the added weight.....careful not to put more strain on your lower back."
0,No Reception,"This is a beautiful, high-tech looking clock with all of the information I want. The jumbo display in nice so I can read it from accross my office. The only problem I had was the clock wouldn't receive the radio controlled time. I tried at the office and at home, both inside and outside, but nothing. I live in suburban Detroit, and I have no problems with radio reception whether AM or FM. This clock was close to want I wanted, but without the atomic time feature, I'm returning it and continuing to search."
1,Very Good Album,"I enjoyed listening to this album...I just think that whatever label they're on should promote them more, because you don't see or hear much about them, and they are better than a lot of these groups out today. They're harmonies are TIGHT, and it's good to not hear the same leading voice ALL THE TIME...they all have talent!"
1,Psychic Attunement working for me!,"I took the Psychic Attunement several times. It did take a few weeks after receiving the Attunements before I did notice an improvement in my psychic abilities, and my psychic abilities keep on improving with time. Taking the Psychic Attunement has been successful for me. I'm buying the Psychic Attunement Vol. 2 DVD to take my Psychic abilities to the next level. The few negative reviews I spotted for this DVD you can tell are from skeptics to begin with, and their reviews show they did not give the Attunement time to work. If you are a skeptic and/or and want instant psychic abilities, I do not recommend this DVD because the attunement does not work that way...it's a process. I do recommend the DVD if you are really interested in developing your psychic abilities because it's a great tool to help develop your psychic abilities."
0,Follow The Link......And Save,"I may be missing something, but I own a pair of Cobra PR-4200s also made by Cobra. Other than the fact that the faceplate on the 4100s is blue, they appear to be exactly the same radio. Same range, appearance, weather option, features, everything. They are except for the color exact duplicates. The only big exception is the vast difference in price. The 4200s are $25 brand new, while you can't even get a pair of these refurbished for that price. The new price for them was listed at $70 as of this writing. If you are at all considering these radios I strongly advise you to follow the link enclosed and check out the 4200s. I left a very favorable review for them for both performance and price. They're an excellent basic two way radio, and the very cheapest radios with the NOAA weather option available on Amazon as of this writing...Cobra PR-4200-2WX VP Micotalk 18-Mile Range 2-Way Radio - 2 Pack"

0,Hon Task Chair,"I owned a Hon task chair for over 30 years. The only reason I needed to replace it was that the seat padding had deteriorated. EVERYTHING else about the chair was in excellent condition. So I didn't hesitate to buy another Hon. It's the last one I'll ever buy. Although it looks identical, and the description says it's identical to my previous chair, those are the only things remotely similar. This chair is cheap, poorly made, with inferior materials. The seat padding is so close to non-existent, it's like sitting on a rock. The movements work so poorly, I won't be the least bit surprised if they stop working altogether. The best thing I can say about this chair is that it looks good. Caveat emptor definitely applies here."

I am finding typo and other errors that are making me question the general reliability of the book. For example, on page 15 the c code in the book uses jll to increment a loop counter instead of j++. Also the book does not show how you can use ac structure to access the individual bits of a stored byte of information -- check out a Herbert Schildt book on c programming. Such a structure would help people to better understand the setting of bits for the various control bytes used in the pic device."

0,"Verizon's ""broad""band extremly slow","I've own a Verizon data card for over a year now and the connection speed is becoming extremely slow. I tested everywhere including in house, on the road, airport etc. The avg download is about 400K and upload 140K. These are significantly slower than what I was promised at the store and the results of my tests when I first bought it (800K/400K).I called Verizon. The tech support guy was very rude and basically said this speed is normal and ""broadband"". He also tried to come up with excuses such as you are indoor although he had to agree that my signal strength was good. He also said as long as you could connect, you couldn't argue because there was no promise of the speed on the contract. (So basically even if your speed was 1K, they wouldn't see a problem with it.)My conclusion, I will never use Verizon again."

You can listen to them without distraction and thoroughly enjoy the experience. Or you can use them as wonderful background music for dinner guests. Or as the backdrop to a seduction scene. Beautiful and versatile music."

Highly recommended!!"
1,"No surprises, this is my second set, sold the car with the first set.","A sturdy product and easy to install. I much prefer the in-channel mount over the exterior version for a cleaner look and more secure mounting.Manufacturer's packaging was .. OK....nothing broken but the foam pieces stuck in between the parts to prevent chafing of the plastic were too small, too thin and not properly placed to protect the compound shape at the ends. My set had some unsightly chafing marks which I buffed out with headlight lens compound.This set had the same problem with preventing windows closing that my previous set had in that the sharp edge on the bottom corners of the rear window shades hung up on the top edge of the glass when rolling up the windows which prevents closing. I filed a bevel on the bottom edges inside the channel with a nail file to allow the edge of the glass to ride past that corner and continue closing."

Unfortunately this bike has very poor quality parts, brakes, wheels, shifters, etc. If you need to get a cool bike for around [...] get one of these but make sure it comes from a store that can work with you on set up. Forget being able to adjust the brakes or gears yourself. Basically this is a childs bike made to look like an adults bike. I'm 5 foot 10 inches and this bike is way too small.

These speakers were among the 10 best computer speakers rated by an audio pro on the net. I would buy these again for other equipment and recommend them to others."

0,Don't believe the Hype!,"I need to wear a mouth guard every night or I wake up with a bad headache (not a fun way to start your day). I have tried pretty much every type of night guard on the market over the years and I must say this was by far the worst. I tried it for an entire month before giving up and going back to something else. The main issues I see with the item include: its not nearly as customizable as it should be, the bit wings are too thick, and all the pressure from grinding is isolated on just a few teeth. This last issue causes tooth pain and not just the usual soreness. Purchase a custom dental guard from your dentist if you can afford it. Otherwise, buy something you can boil then carefully customize yourself."
0,Do Not Buy This Book,"This isn't history, at it's worst the political bias is as bad as Doctor Quinn Medicine Woman. I suggest reading Alexander Hamilton by Ron Chernow, or works that influenced him like David Hume if anyone is interested in his psyche. I have to add this as I am sick Hamilton bashing and this book is the epitome of such ignorance aka revisionism. The author needs to study more before writing such and calling it history. As another reviewed stated so well, ""For me, the lack of objectivity and balance compromises this work thereby transforming it into a socio-political diatribe rather than an objective history."""

The MP3 playback is cool, the pitch-change buttons (for karoke) is a neat feature, and the DVD's played back just fine...For 6 months. The player started exhibiting the problems described by other reviewers. The DVD would just stop displaying video (the sound would continue...it was like the video board was generating non-playable video), and if you tried to eject the disk, the player would lock-up. Subsequent power-on's would cause a ""click-click"" from the drive and a dark panel. We got it to come out of it's self-induced coma a couple of times, but now it's completely dead.

0,High Kitsch,"Geddes' manages to degrade and isolate her subjects. Her prehistoric ""cutsie"" images, though appealing to a kitsch market, do not allow for a social comment to transcend the visual confines of her exploitive commercial ""photography"". In some senses, she could be seen as a radical post-modernist artist, as she abstracts the subject from social normality and removes any dignity from the development of the child, if that was her so calling in contemporary art. Yet it is frightening to be in an age where people will grasp such superficially degrading images. Geddes has made a personal fortune off photographing babies, subjects usually positioned in inhumane circumstances (ie: babies in flowerpots or dipped in custard), which removes human dignity and allows us to question Geddes moral intent."

0,Jason doing what he does . . . again,"Jason X begins with Jason Vorhees being studied as to why his cells continue to regenerate allowing him to escape death over and over. In a transfer to another facility he naturally escapes and kills everyone except one woman who tries to freeze him cryogenically but Jason breaches the chamber and they both get frozen. They are found 450 years later and brought on board a space craft where a scientist and his team of teenage students revive them and mayhem ensues.I thought the premise to get Jason to space and catapult him ahead a few centuries was kind of clever and there are some moments of humor throughout the movie that worked, but otherwise it's the same old same old. No one can act, they all do stupid things that no one not in a horror movie would do and Jason just walks around slaughtering everyone. There is no originality beyond the opening and I guess its debatable just how original that was."

1,I did see some results,"What's NOT to like about this book? It is thorough, answered every question I ever had about growing taller, and some questions I hadn't even thought about asking. But, the bottom line is, the techniques discussed in this book work. I have gained an inch in height in just a few months using just a few of the exercises outlined in this book. That might not seem like much, but for me ( I am over 30 ), it is a BIG accomplishment. As for all these negative reviews, my guess is they either didn't even try the techniques correctly, or they are written by this books competitor. (Notice the same broken English in several of these ""reviews""). I definitely recommend this book to anyone who would like a REALISTIC guide to gaining an inch or two in height in a fairly short time."

Don't Trip touches on reality and things that we as normal ""church folk"" can relate to. When it comes to laughter and craziness and those mmm huh stories, Steve does it best. I applaud you Steve for taking a stand for the ""Lawd"" (as Steve would say)and keeping it clean."

0,Just Not Fun!,I bought this toy for my son when he was about 6 months old. He is now 2 years old and has never played with it. To hear the giggle you have to shake it a certain way and my son doesn't have the patience for that as i am sure most toddlers do not.

0,Sleazy Sex,"Does a man fall into deep, passionate, soul-scorching love with a woman after one night of sex? Lust, maybe, but never love, yet this is one of the premises of this inane book. Out of desperation for something to read, I attempted another Stella Cameron book--same scenario. This kind of sleazy sex is so boring. The author's fantasy that sleazy sex results in love and marriage is not only not realistic, its laughable. I hope no teenage girls get a hold of these books. They might then conclude that having sex after knowing a man only a few hours is the way to find a husband. And what about AIDS? This book is just really disgusting and really stupid."

In my very humble opinion, I don't like this singer at all. Her music is a well-made 'collage' of other musical styles. Nothing new. She pretends to sound like... Etta James?? Her image of the 'New Bad Girl in the Music Scene' appears completely false and empty. Lots of dirty language in her songs, add nothing better to her music and image.Then I say: AW is a NO-NO-NO choice for serious music listeners! Don't spend your money buying music from this artist. Period!"
0,I didn't like any of them!,"I found this book intensely irritating. Hoping for a great summer read, I found all the characters unsympathetic and annoying - I can honestly say I didn't like a single character in the book and could not identify with even one of them. The book wandered on aimlessly,I was tempted to give up but I kept hoping it would get better, sadly it didn't. A really aggrevating and disappointing book. Sorry, but I really didn't like it."

0,Extended Version Held Hostage,"I believe that the studios are trying the same old tricks. First sell the theatrical version and milk it for all it is worth, then release the extended version and create new ferver to vacuum out the rest. I fell for it once and bought the extended version 6 months later. Never again. If they want my money, I will only give it to them once. My money has become very precious to me and I will make sure I spend it more wisely. Many Blu Ray players will take the DVD and up-convert the content to give it a better quality. I can live with that until the extended version is released. Put companies on notice. You want our business, then give us what we want, and not a poor substitute. I made sure to read which version was being released. I will not allow you to trick me again."
0,Good subject matter but bad presentation,"First of all, the subject matter is very engaging. The issue is that the pages are barely readable. This edition is a photocopy of the original and the actual image size is much smaller than the size of the book. Add to this that some pages are blurry and reading becomes a challenge. Every now and then, one page is blank, which shows the level of care which went into this edition. Mayhew deserves better treatment."
1,Brewing on ...,We had an older model for years of enjoyment as we drink coffee frequently throughout the day. Operation is similar to the previous model so there was no learning curve. Only difference is that the older model had a water level indicator we could see from the outside but this doesn't -- need to look in from the top to see where the water is. We did that once and then started using a measuring cup to fill with the right amount of water and then dump into the cofee maker versus stretching our necks over the top. Otherwise -- great product for the price.

0,Um ow.....,I bought this based on the good reviews...funny all the reviews dissapeard along with my first review. Let me say the sound quality is great I can hear everything on the other end. Sadly they can't hear me very well! Even though it comes with different sized ear parts none of them feel well after about 30 minutes of talking on the phone. You have to adjust it over and over. When you finally get it comfortable it the mic is up by your eyes. That would be great if I talked through my eyes but I don't. After 30 minutes the pain starts. It doesn't feel good at all. After an hour you might as well be getting your brain drilled into. I won't even get into what happens if you accidentally drop your phone while wearing this headset I doubt amazon will aprove the words...

It's very quiet (whereas the JM400 sounds like a small jet aircraft).Don't try to run kale into your JM400. It's too weak and won't be able to juice it.Bottom line. The JM400 is just a toy. I should have purchased the CuisinArt in the first place."
0,Worked great for two weeks and the broke,I used this product for two weeks. It was working well and then suddenly stopped gyrating. It is out of balance or something and just doesn't work. It was handled with care and used as intended. It is not well made.
0,Bad 80s? No Thanks,"Except for Zakk Starkey on drums, there is no reason to buy this album. The vocals are a bad Paul Rodgers copy and the songs are a cross between Mr. Mister and the Outfield, minus the commerical success. The late Mr. Entwistle should be comended for trying to form another group after the Who ""broke up,"" but this was really a stiffing of his personality for the sake of pop music that didn't go anywhere. The album really doesn't hold up well and there's only one song up to the standards of older Entwistle compositions. Hell, when I saw the Rock on tour in '87, they could barely make it through the set. Even John had enough and left the stage half way through the set. Buy another Entwistle album."
1,Goes down easy,"I am a person who hates to exercise. Having said this, I really, really like this tape. I like the fact that you can use the different intensity levels. At one point, I was doing the high intensity workout, and after I had recovered from surgery, I was doing the low one, and still getting a challenging workout. I also like the fact that the steps are very easy, as I don't like dancy tapes. I just want to sweat, not try out for the Rockettes. I also like the fact that Kathy is probably as unirritating as a fitness host is ever going to be. I say this because I find most hosts on these tapes to act and chirp like lobotomized cheerleaders and Kathy does not. She's more like a normal person who's helping you along."

1,Better than most razors but still not perfect,"This razor is really cool and is so simple to use. It works great and provides a very close shave to ALMOST every part of your face. There are still some issues with getting on the neck in those hard to reach areas. You have to be careful or you end up rubbing your neck raw and that looks worse than if you missed a spot. All in all, a great razor and much easier and faster than a regular razor. 4 out of 5."
1,Ech...,"Ok, I love this game to death. All though I could use the money to buy Sonic battle or other but I wanted this game here. I played it and it remended me of a RPG but you have more options to move around. The only thing I have a problems with this game is that in is full of mini-games. Mini-games that you MUST complete in order to move on in the game. But of course if you love the bitter irony of Luigi being the Mr.Green fraidy-cat then go on and by the game. I laugh during most of the game play cause the animations remended me of some silly anime expressions. Hmm. That's nintendo for you."
0,It keeps losing the settings!,"I actually bought this at a local store. It works but every once in awhile, the remote will reset and I'd have to get out the book to re-enter the code for my tv. There's no explanation as to why but I am getting pretty tired of resetting the remote. Maybe be cheap but it doesn't work. :("
0,Frustration!,"I have enjoyed Perry Mason for many years and, like many folks, want season 3 to be released(volumes 1 and 2 together) and I would gladly pay the high prise. It amazes me that newer shows like ""Friends"" have already released most (if not all) seasons already! I've been waiting forever for Mason! I bought 23 DVD's from the Columbia House which had 3 shows on their DVDs and were around $23.00 each! Most of the shows on the Columbia House volumes had episodes from the first 4 box sets recently released.One of the greatest shows ever and I'm at a loss as to these delays. I haven't seen the 50th DVD yet but I agree with most all of the other folks who have aired their views. Thank you!"

1,An insightful view into the life a brilliant journalist,"This unauthorized biography provided a rare view into the unusual life and career of one of the finest journalists of the 20th century. Oriana Fallaci has jealously guarded her own privacy, while making a career out of revealing often unflattering views of the movers and shakers of the 20th century. Oriana Fallaci's take her influence from her anti-fascist, intellectually idealistic upbringing. She worked tirelessly to break out of the limited existence most often reserved to a woman of her era. Her great political interviews and masterpieces like ""A Letter to a Child Never Born"" and ""Inshallah"" attest to her incisive, unconventional insight. I always wished to know more about her and now have had the opportunity.Santo Arico is to be congratulated for finally shedding light on the incredible life journey of the most influential female journalist of our time."
0,Completely inaccurate,"This thermometer never gives the same reading twice, and the temperatures can vary by quite a large margin. You simply cannot depend on the thermometer to tell you if you have a fever or not. I wish I could still get one of those old-fashioned mercury thermometers (the kind you have to shake down)."
0,Insufficiently detailed description of tool,"As a means to understand how to use the Developer 2000 series of programs, this book lacks detail or explanation. It tries to straddle a description of methodology and that of program function, and does a poor job of the latter.We already have a good understanding of how to get the job done -- we just wanted to use the tool. Thus, we only skimmed the parts of the book we considered were just a tepid introduction to Yourdon.If you already comfortable with task analysis, problem decomposition, and normalization, and simply want to know how to use this tool to develop a system, move on to something more practical, such as ""Rapid Application Development With Oracle Designer/2000"" by Chris Billings, et.al."
1,OFF THE HOOK,Look if you don't have this game you are straight up wack.the graphics were of the chain. You have to get this game right now. If a store don't have this game something is wrong.

1,Ear sound amplifiers.,"These hearing aids are really excellent! They are quite small and perfect for listening to conversations, birds singing, TV and theater. The sets came with plenty of batteries and ear adaptors for comfort. The volume controls are easy to work. I bought a couple of sets just in case of loss since the pricing is so low.DGH"
1,Best Racing Game Ever!,"Buy this game, it's so realistic & so much fun I love Laguna Seca! The way the bike slides, rides moves & crashes are brilliant hope SBK2002 comes out soon;) I'm sick of Formula One games with the same tracks over & over this is a great substitute."
0,Garmin Suction Mount Poor design,"Don't purchase if you ever plan to move the mount! As it will with normal sun heat self-glue to windshield and seperate (peel) off. You's need a razor to scrap remaining residue off windshield. Or if it comes off cleanly warping will not allow a clean seal to windshield and you will end up catching the falling device in traffic from the floor board. I wrapped the pwr cord around the rearview to prevent this while the approx 30min suction held. Buying replacements cups from Nuvi are non-existant. They will only sell you a whole unit for $30.00, that works out to be $30 x every 3mths = $120yr. of aggravation. On the plus side the actual unit is a gem."

0,Mediorcre at best,"I can forgive ppv's and wrestling shows with a few lame matches, as long as they have other matches that make up for it. This one had the bad matches... and that's it. The lucha match was ok but not as good as the three way at starcade of 98. And the Goldberg x Hall ladder match. There were only two cool bumps in that match, one was an elbow drop almost from the top by Scott, and the other was when Goldberg hit his head on the rope as he fell with the ladder, it looked liked he couldv'e seriously hurt his neck but got lucky. COME ON! The best slam of the night was a flub, an accident... boring tape don't get it."

1,Shrub Sculpture Tool,"Ths is the perfect tool for sculpting your shrubs....not necessarily for small topiary, but it's good for the amateur gardeners who want to make interesting shapes out of boring shrubs. It will even work to keep the boring ones in shape!ps: It is hard to find in the stores."
0,"Unreliable, difficult to troubleshoot and repair","Although the units are convenient when they're working, they're very inconvenient if something goes wrong. LaCie doesn't have good troubleshooting software. Instead, you get a flashing blue light--really helpful. Taking the drives out and putting them back in is difficult. I'm concerned that the reason two of the four drives failed in ours is because they got too hot. The units are only used for backup, so they don't receive intensive usage."

0,I was shocked!,"This is my fault for buying these. I didn't key into the fleece in the title. I opened up the package and was dispointed to find flannel sheets. I've never had flannel sheets so I decided to give them a shot.It is cold right now in Afghanistan and the flannel sheets were very comfortable at first. But I am a light sleeper and these things kept me up all night. For one thing you can't roll around in them without getting tangled up. They have enough friction that they stick to your clothes when ever you shift positions. This drove me to distraction.Additionally, while I was awake trying to get myself untangled, I was constantly getting shocked. I can just imagine what my daughter, with her long blonde hair, would look like in the morning after sleeping in these.The material is thin and looks like it will wear out quickly, but I'm not really giving them the chance. I ordered something different that will hopefully get here in a few weeks."
0,STILL WAITING....,"I'm still waiting for the movie to start. I didn't see the first movie, but this one was bad. Crude sexual humor, fart and feces humor, and it really wasn't that funny except for the sour cream Sanchez which I had to explain to my mother.Brief nudity and you never see the girl's face attached to the Ta's Ta's, which means they were a body stand in.Outtakes and bloopers were just as bad as the film."
0,Shame on you Sr. Fonsi!,"I am a huge Luis Fonsi fan. However he let me down with this greatest hits collection. What is the point of doing such an album if several hits are not included????? Where is ""Estoy Perdido"", ""Me Ire"" or ""La Fuerza De Mi Corazon"". Also, I think it was poor marketing to sell the DVD separately. As for the two new songs, they are quite dull and uninspiring. The only good thing about this collection is the cover art and liner notes."
0,possible use of defective parts during manufacturing,"although the camera was economically priced for all the features it has to offer, there seems to be a manufacturing defect with my camera. i've tried to contact sharp customer service to try to resolve the problem i was having with playback ( garbled video as well as distorted audio ) they tried to tell me that it maybe the brand of DV tape i am using, but after reviewing this site and seeing that i wasn't only person with this problem, i've come to believe that there is only one reason why the camcorder is failing--- obviously, they must have used a bad batch of parts in the manufacturing process....currently my camcorder is at an authorized service center for repair...i hope that they can fix the problem..i only had the camera less than three weeks...when and if i get the camera back i'll give a updated review of the camera in it's entirety."
1,ONE OF THE BEST SEASONS!!,"Over the years, I have seen every episode of this show and I have to say that along side seasons 3 and 4, season 6 is definately up there with my favorites. The kids are finally treated as adults in this season and it ends with the absolutely breathtaking series finale. I would highly recommend this season."

0,Crossbow with scope does not fit,I am disappointed and returned this item when I found that the Barnett Quad 400 does fit only without a scope mounted on it.When I mounted the scope the cover will not close.I returned the item and got full refund. Thanks to seller.I gave it 2 stars because of seller professional act.
0,Too Much Guesswork?,"I used this book in as a simulation in my Business Strategy class at HLG. I think that the simulation was basically useless because there was entirely too much guesswork involved. There is no mention of what type of product is being manufactured, only that is made out of plastic. When making decisions such as how much to invest in product quality it would have helped quite a bit to know the specific type of product being produced. For example, quality is for more important when producing laptop computer cases than when producing toy army men. I think that the lack of specific information concerning the product and the market are the downfall of this book. The simulation would have been far more enjoyable and beneficial if informed decisions could be made."
0,Machine Malfunctioning,"I have this soy milk maker that often malfunctions for no reason. It starts off fine and then the grinding suddenly stops after a few minutes and the machine signals the end by beeping. I contacted Salton and they sent me a new one, but it has the same problem. Does anyone know how to fix this problem?"
0,Just Foolish,"For Ashanti, I felt very dissapointed with her very frist single, Foolish. Although she brings a little taste of soul into Murder Inc. and everything else, it feels like a remake in the middle. The song samples One More Chance by the late Notorious B.I.G. Although it seemed like a strong debut for a new singer, it falls flat on deaf ears, as a Mariah Carey wannabe. Hopefully, when her next record comes out, she'll probably show a little bit of music to call her own."
0,"Same theme, horrible movie","The only thing Stephen King's novel Cell and this movie share is a common theme. I just viewed Electric Zombies and it is utter garbage. I still have not figured out why people make these movies. Some will say it is a labor of love, but honestly, if I had made this movie myself I would not love it, I would simply be embarassed."

0,Disconnect Problems,"I wanted to just echo what some of the other reviewers have said. When this router IS connected, signal strength is average and speed is decent. However, at least twice a day if not more, the router cuts out wireless to my laptop and desktop (set up elsewhere in the house). I have to go unplug the router, wait 10 seconds, and plug it back in. It's annoying and makes me regret not looking at more reviews before making this purchase. I've heard the Apple Air Extreme has good reliability; that will be my next choice."
0,No Go,"Somewhere in the half-way wasteland between the great OK Comp and the somewhat interesting Kid A, this album is NOWHERE. It really, really is limp-wristed, half-arsed junk. The critics, of course, love it. Believe me - don't waste your time or money. Pass on this."
0,Not worth it,"I highly recommend you don't buy this CD.All this so called ""best of"" collection consists of is,a handfull of random picked calls from their first two albums on Select Records,two completly unfunny previously unreleased phone calls,and some of their characters giving some stupid advice about different things.This collection is not worth the time or the money.I recommend just buying all of the Jerky Boys' CDs seperate,and not even bothering with this."
1,Great Chairs - especially for the price.,They weren't too hard to put together. The price was great and shipping was pretty fast.
0,It's all in Japanese,"I'm a fan of Oriental ghost stories. Their culture, especially Japan, breathed new life into the genre,especially after the American remake of The Ring. I couldn't follow the plot of this movie as there were no English translations. I have run into several movies that I was unable to watch due to no English captions on Amazon. Very frustrating..."
0,perhaps it is my fault,"i got stuck once at a conference because I forgot my cones for my pump, so i set out to create an ""emergency"" stock of cones for the pump and car. I bought these connectors. I know there is a picture...maybe i didn't see it...maybe it wasn't there...maybe i am not that famililar with pump products...but I was SOOOO disappointed to find that these did not come with the yellow half circle things that make these connectors work with the shields. ugg.... then, i was at babies r us and those yellow things cost as much as a fully assembled cone, so i just bought the fully assembled cones... i am disappionted this didn't come more complete for the price...."
1,Excellent Camcorder,"This is an excellent camcorder, it small, easy to carry around, and has good battery life. It even fits into a inexpensive carying case we had our for digital camera. It has a lot of great features and served us well on our vacation. Its been said before, but the only real drawback to this is the instructions. To Claridy: The camcorder can transfer still pics from its SD slot via a USB cable, you will need firewire to transfer it to the computer or use as a webcam - both which work very well. It also has all the necessary cables you will need if you just want to hook it up to your VHS/Home DVD burner via A/V cables and record, or just watch the playback on a TV. It could use an external audio mic output, but we found the internal microphone is quite sensitive and met our needs very well. Overall: Definately recomended"

0,Not something I would buy ever again,"The overall quality of Pampers has gone down so much and babydry is worse of all. after just two hours of putting it on, it breaks and actually all the inside material comes out. I had to vacuum so many times after having such incidents. no more babydry for us."
0,BROKE after only 6 months,"I bought this product for my girls room who are 4 and 8. I loved it at first, the music didn't annoy me nor did the fact that you can only turn it off and on by pressing the button. I turned the lamp off this morning to get my kids ready for school, went to turn it on before bed tonight and the thing doesn't work, I replaced light bulbs tried different plugs in the house, turned it off and on about 50 times to no avail. This really upsets me since we only have had it for 6 months. I would have given a much higher rating but I think it is a rip off for only working that long. AND NO it didn't fall or anything, the lamp is in perfect shape still, I could resell it by picture if it weren't for it not turning on at ALLLLL... I am really upset as you can see. Good luck to all of you who already purchased this just to find out in 6 months it won't work."
0,I really hope people aren't buying this stuff on here..,Let me begin by saying that I work FOR Chanel cosmetics and I cannot believe people are trying to sell these products for such high prices on here. This mascara only costs $30 at the Chanel counter. Don't be fooled by these sellers. I just saw a $23 nail polish priced at $34.
0,Do not buy this game,This was the first game i bought and unless you are a teen genius only adults know the answer.
0,You have got to be kidding me!,"First of all, anybody who actually spends money to buy this CD is smoking crack. This guy has no talent whatsoever. I love people that say he believes in what he is doing. Sure he does, he is stealing your money. I would believe in that as well. This CD is a perfect example of why American Karaoke, I mean American Idol, needs to just go away. Personally, I am going to wait until his greatest hits album comes out before I make a purchase. Nice going, Will. Enjoy the 15 minutes."
0,Just Don't Rent It,"Ok, any femanist who watches this movie would rather scratch their eyes out then watch this movie. Women begging for dates, suspecting their husbands of making bad choices or settling for guys who won't commit.....what an exciting concept for a movie. Ahh, I think NOT! I am shocked so many high profile actors agreed to take these characters on. I was completely disappointed by this movie. It wasn't worth the $3.99 I paid for the rental."
0,Ronan doesn't have unique voice,"he should sing baladeand he should go back in BoyzoneStephen Gately has a far more better quality album, but just because of lack of geniune help from record company, didn't let him climb high as Ronan. Ronan can't sing the way Stephen sings. He got all that just because everybody weirdly helped him.Being a fan of Boyzone for 8 years, I can tell who can sing and who can't! Just watch Boyzone's Live performances, you'll get the answer."
1,straight to the point,"to add to the other reviews, I like this book because I'm the type of writer that needs an ""assignment"" to make sure I don't keep writing about the same things. With this book, it's easy to follow along and take out what you need and go back later to the other prompts the second or third time around. I'm a firm believer that a person should go through a book like this two or more times to get the full benefits."
0,Good to start then falls off,"Though the game was quite addicting at first (Levels 1-20), it then began to loose some of its uniques as you spend most of your time leveling at an extremely slow pace. The quests are a tad bit on the lean side. After you reach level 50 the game looses much of its appeal as you cant level any higher. The main problem i had with the game is there was no purpose for your character. Sure you had quests but after you finsih them all whats next? wandering around killing people. Not my idea of fun."
1,Newfie Owner,We have a 110 lb Newfoundland dog who sheds lots of long hair. This vacuum is great on carpet and hardwood! Cleans far better than any vacuum I've tried. Only complaint is I need to use scissors to cut long dog hair from rollers about once a week (I use vacuum 1-2x per day).

0,BE CAREFUL !!!,"i have this vacuum...it is very very powerful and does not have a height setting....your delicate oriental or older carpets will be damaged if you use this vacuum with the beater bar engaged. If the beater bar is not engaged, all you are getting is suction and it simply does not clean well because it is a hard wood floor setting. This vacuum badly damaged my gorgeous oriental rugs !!"
0,Clippers that don't want to cut hair?!?,"When I bought these clippers July 2008, they worked fairly well for a few weeks for trimming my beard but then stopped cutting consistently. Since I live within a few miles of Sturtevant, I brought the clipper set to the Andis factory to see about getting them repaired. Instead they took my information and gave me a replacement on the spot.The replacement sounded different than the original, much quieter and slower-sounding, but still it was apparently the same model. It worked well as far as I knew, but recently I tried using it to trim the hair on my head. Beard hair, being far coarser, gets cut fairly easily, but cutting head hair using anything but the shortest attachments is virtually impossible. Using the one-inch comb, the clippers were more likely to push the hairs out of the way than to actually cut them!"
1,My 9th grade English class loved it!,"I ordered this video for my freshmen English class! My class was reading ""From a White House Diary"" by Lady Bird Johnson and this was a great video for my students to get a better understanding of their nation's history! My students were engaged the entire time and truly enjoyed this film. :)"
0,"good for eight to ten year olds, but not avid modelists","I bought this model to expand upon my Superhero collection, which typically are vinyl high detail products. This model however was plastic, with uneven match points, and very poor detail. This model would be good for beginners, but for folks who try to take pride in the detail of thier work, this model is not for you. There is no amount of work you could do to make the model look any better than it does on the box, which appears to be the original sculpture it was molded after."
0,Lame,"If you're even reading this review that means you're probably considering buying this CD, well don't. Good Charlette blows, they lack any real talent and are probably the biggest group of posers to come along since Limp Bizkit. Anyone who's even considering this CD has no real taste for good music, and is probably mildly retarded. Actually I take that back even a retarded person wouldn't allow themselves to be subjected to listening to this crap. So why don't all you punk rock posers do us all a favor and go crawl under a rock with you're s***ty music because the rest of the world is sick of it.p.s.Ya mugentyper, it's not that it's cool to dislike Good Charlette, they just really suck, so why don't you shut the hell up cause nobody cares what canadians think about music, you f***ing tard."
1,"Seems to be good quality, but mine arrived with dust on it","This seems to be a fairly basic cover for your expensive lens. Simply, this is good insurance. The optics looks perfectly fine to me. I can discern absolutely zero difference between photos taken with - and without - the filter applied. That said, the filter arrived covered in white dust and I was suprised that they didn't include a cheap lens wipe in the package."

0,Missed opportunities.,"There are hundreds, perhaps thousands of sci-fi action novels that are good for an evening's entertainment. They read fast, the plot is shallow, and the characters wooden. You aren't disappointed because you didn't expect much.This pretty much describes Eagle Against the Stars. Yet, I was disappointed. White had a chance to take a major theme, the meeting of two cultures, one more advanced and do something interesting. Sort of a Science Fiction version of what happened to Japan when it met the west in the 19th century. I could see a fat book chuck full of details that could keep me busy for weeks.Unfortunately he took the easy way out and wrote a libertarian space opera complete with shallow characters, snide anti Liberal asides and predictable plot. As space opera, its worth reading. Yet, it coulda been a contender.J. A. Schroeder Seattle, WA"
0,Bored to tears!,"While this book starts out in an interesting way it quickly becomes bogged down with boring, tedious, repetitive dialogue. The characters say the same things to each other over and over again. Nothing happens until almost 2/3 of the way into the book. Even then, it is very slow moving and somewhat predictable. I have never read anything else by this author and I probably won't after this. My advice: pass on this one and read something else, maybe something by Jo Beverly or Heather Cullman (just for examples)."
1,My favorite kitchen tool,"I've had one of these for years and I use it so much I'm surprised it's still working. I've had food processors since they came on the market and this one has lasted the longest, and it gets used here. When I bought this thing I had no idea I'd have it more than a year or two, because I really use a processor; but, I'm thinking this one has lasted at least five years. I am a from scratch cooker and it's used all the time and I've even given it as wedding presents. Sauce prep is a snap, but my favorite is the way it handles bread. It was the first processor I had that let me mix a standard big loaf without having to knead in half the remaining dough, and it's fast. The only reason I'm looking to buy another now is this one came up under sale items and my bowl is not as pretty as it once was and it would be nice to have a back up just in case it broke. Plus, they make good wedding gifts."
0,Editor please,"These reviewers are not exaggerating; there are multiple typos on nearly every page. The poor editing broke the flow of the book and I found myself frustrated during the read (perhaps this isn't very ACT minded of me). While reading, I thought we would never accept this of a graduate psychology student's academic or professional writing, yet they can sell it to me for $20. The ACT principles are communicated intelligently and clearly in this book."
0,Returning this book,This book did not come with a dustcover even though it is a hardback edition. The size is very small - more like a paperback. I am not happy with this book and will be returning it.
1,Algebra made easy,"An excellent textbook! Applications make algebra part of everyday's life... as it really is. The book ends with the concept that numbers are abstract things. I teach math & calculus, and I found it the best text in Algebra I I have ever used!!!"

0,Disturbing for little ones,"I'll just get right to it. One of the puppies is run over and killed by a tractor. My four year old ran up to his room crying when this happened and my 8 year old sat on the couch stunned with watery eyes. It really ticks me off when kid's movies do this. It is so unnecessary. My kids already have parents and we do a pretty good job teaching and preparing our kids for life. When I pop a movie in and offer them some popcorn, it is for one reason only; to provide entertainment and pleasure. It is not so some stranger can attempt to teach them lessons on death and loss. Really inappropriate and unnecessary. I am suprised no other review has mentioned this...Like other reviews point out, the kids were very obnoxious. They are horribly behaved and at one point, one of them even yells at an adult and call him names (the adult was a likeable character, not even a bad guy)in front of their parents, who do nothing about it. Awful movie."
0,"""A two you say""",Yes a 2 not because I am not a fan of Yes but because the digital remastering is HORRID. If people are praising the sound on this because it's better than the vinyl then the vinyl must have been unlistenable. This is all top end and it seems every instrument is trying to compete at being higher on the scale than Jon's own voice. Nerve racking to say the least. IMHO this is not worth keeping in my changer while I have all the studio remasters which are all keepers.
1,excellent,"I am not a real horror person, but I got sucked into the twistng plot that went on for 6 wonderful books."
0,"Tried, came close, failed","...A brilliant idea was left to rot.John Hobbes (Denzel Washington) is the capturer of a serial killer, Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas, in the film's best role), who is sent to his death laughing and singing and promising that he'd be back. While some discrepancies between Reese and the evidence in the murders he committed nags at Hobbes, a riddle Reese asked him shortly before the execution turns up the suicide of a polieman thirty years ago and entangles Hobbes in the web that binds these two cases together with thousands of years of history and the supernatural.Yeah, it's a great premise. Too bad it's given such short shrift in here. Every aspect of this film was done better in Seven, despite the difference in their mechanations (the killer in Fallen really IS supernatural), and held up against its predecessor, Fallen leaves a whole lot to be desired."
1,More than meets the eye,"I love this movie and decided to buy it on DVD. now I consider myself a tough critic (I have Animal House, Fast Times, Stripes, Spies Like Us, Fletch, Billy Madison, Napolean Dynamite, etc) and this movie has a lot of subtle, and hilarious, moments. For example, Will Farrell might be one of the most overlooked players in this flick. As Big Earl, he's friggin' awesome: ...I'm not gonna lie, things are gonna get weird. Two dragons..."" AMAZING! [watch the scene; a true comedic vision]. Whether you're a comedy buff, Snoop Dogg fan [he's perfect for the Huggy role] or comedy afficianado, won't be disappointed, check it out."
0,I question Christopher Hitchens credibility,"I used to work for Gift of Love, Mother Teresa's Aids Hospice in San Francisco. What Christopher Hitchens reports about the hospice is completely untrue. We administered pain medication on demand. Our hospice was highly recommended by UCSF's Aids clinic and all of the AIDS organization in SF. We had a long waiting list of AIDS patients trying to get in. Public Health Nurses would work on a daily basis at the hospice and were highly supportive of its operation. In this one area, Christopher Hitchens seems to have purposefully sought out people who would support his side of the story. Such deterministic reporting makes me wonder about the accuracy of the rest of his book. The title reflects his bias. Hilary Kotter"
1,Good Book,This was a great course book for use with my business class Itook last term. I had current up to date examples and was veryreadable.
0,The anti-sherlock,I watched SH today and could not wait for it to end. An example of mediocrity overwhelming a once revered character. Too bad. I ordered the 12 dvd set of Sherlock Holmes that was on sale today on amazon.com so it could help erase this version of Sherlock from my memory.
0,THIS SUCKS STAY AWAY,BUYER BEWARE ! ! !YES THE DIAPERS ARE GOOD BUT I RECEIVED THE DIAPERS WITH STAINS THEY LOOK LIKE DNA STAINS. SO I CALL THE COMPANY AND THEY INSTRUCT ME TO TROW THEM AWAY ALL 200 DIAPERS WOW.

0,disappointed,"I bougth thus storage case so my 4 yr old daughter could put her polly clothes somewhere out of the way. I don't like it because the small items like shoes etc.. get stuck behind the pull out bins . When something gets caught my daughter has to ask me to get it out, which is hard because of the material the shoes are made out of. I wouldn't recommend this storage case to anyone I ended up buyinga plastic pencil case for her pollys and it's better. It's also a pitchintg hazard becaue it's hard to get fingers behind the bins to get anything out."
1,Nice compact stand for a small space,I bought this stand because of its smaller size to fit between a fireplace and a window and it works beautifully. The stand comes in a lot of pieces but goes together fast and easy. There are 2 wall braces that require being screwed into the wall. This makes it super sturdy.
1,kanye west is da greatest MC from the Roc ever,"foregt about Jay-Z, Kanye west has taken over roc-a-fella. buy this album, it's da bomb and his flow is great and his beats are off da hook."
0,Pretty Terrible.,"Well I don't want to be mean for the sake of being mean, but this is a terrible movie. It is poorly acted, poorly written, and it's has a few scenes that the direction would make a high school drama club cringe. In addition the movie has vaguely Christian themes, but no substance. The only real enjoyment I got out of this was heckling it with my friends. There is a review on the cover that says it is the best western since ""Tombstone""; That is a bold face lie. In addition it says that it has Daniel Baldwin on the cover. Now I'm not a Baldwin fan but it is always a sign of a bad movie when they list the biggest actor on the cover and he has maybe 5 lines and about 30 seconds on screen."
0,Elevator Music from the Romantic Period...,"I had to find out for myself if there really existed some unjustly neglected piano concertos from the romantic period. If neglected ""gems"" do exist, they are certainly not these concertos. For me, these compositions were just ""adequate"". Sort of the ""elevator-music"" from the romantic period of the piano concerto. Heavy on virtuosity, without any particularly distinguishing features. I couldn't remember a single melody from these concertos, even after repeated listenings. That's how unremarkable they are."
1,Plush Puppet,This item is very cute. I ordered this for a school project. My only complaint is that it is actually quite small...I have a hard time getting my hand into it. It is sized more for a child.
0,Boring!,"I was very disappointed with this book. I thought David Guterson had so much talent in ""Snow Falling on Cedars"", which is what drew me to purchase his new book. I was wrong! This story was SO BORING, with no reason for me to continue after page 30."
1,Good album - but nothing special,"This album like many rock/emo albums is good, but there is nothing innovative about it, some very catchy tunes, good singing, nice rhythm. Awesome to listen to. Worth the buy."
0,Worthless,"I have played all of the Tomb Raider series. I consider myself above average with gaming control, and this game has the worst control of any of the Tomb Raider games. Laura is slow and delayed in her movements. The days of fast moving Laura with precision jumps is gone. I assume my dog and I would have an equal chance of playing Laura against an advanced foe. I have decided to make a Frisbe out of my CD so I can at least get some enjoyment from the game. I will never buy another Tomb Raider game without a test drive from the store or a rental. The TR5 engine will have be brought back to save the Tomb Raider series, and it will be difficult to get back the people who have written it off. The only people who will enjoy this game are those who have suffered a stroke and have impared motor skills. What a shame to disgrace the best action adventure game of all time."
1,This is the first Doig book I read. Wonderful,"What a beautiful book, yet tragic. As usual the writing is simply wonderful. If you love literature, this is a must. The story chronicles the migration of a couple of Scottish families to Montana and the trials and tribulations that they experience. The book is masterful. A must read."
0,Not for Rats,"I bought this to contain a litter of rats but the thing curled in on itself. Even the mama rat was able to crawl underneath it.I did set it up ""against"" the curl but it still would not stand up."
1,Great album with some minor scratches and skips,It's always a craps shoot when buying used vinyl. The tone and depth of the sound is great but there are some minor skips and scratches. Besides those problems the album itself is a great collection of Billy Joel songs and a necessary addition to anyone's collection.
1,You WILL use it everyday!,"We got this for my retired parents for Christmas. Once we had it set up, I found myself constantly checking on the temperatures and seeing whether the forecast was looking up or down. It's seemed very accurate as we were planning our ""beach days"" around what the weather station said, and it was always right. Highly recommended. Easy to program, easy to use, and easy to understand."
0,Good... for a while.,"It worked fine, until I noticed that I started sucking at Guitar Hero. I tried the other remote, and I did better, so I figured it must be the remote. After charging, I noticed that the bad remote was way hotter than the good one. I read reviews on here and saw that other people have had overheating problems, too.One remote is still fine, but I'm having doubts. I've had it for about 3 months. Rechargeable AA batteries might be a better choice; they're less expensive."
1,Great Movie,"Far and Away is a beautiful story of the American dream. It's told like a fairytale, but in a more updated style. I think this element is missed by many who see it. It's very well done and beautifully shot with great performances. The music/score is also excellent."
0,"[Uh oh, looks like trouble...]","I loved the format of the book and the way it integrated with the application. Even the way it integrates with the Lotus Exam Guide (WORD TO WORD!!). Bonus! you might think since everything that is in the book is clear and precise and right (except the answer to question 33 in the 520 test). BUT!!The surprise comes with the real exam. Out of 40 questions, I can honestly say that for 10 of them I had NO Idea what they were talking about(they were NOT covered in the book) and 15 were WEB oriented (which is barely covered in the book). The format of the demo exam is NOT anywhere near what you will have to face at the real test.My suggestion, Get 4 computers, this book and the whole bunch of Lotus Redbook, build your own network and make SURE you know what is the minimum permission for EVERYTHING!"
0,Terrible,"I was not aware until I received the product that it was not a bracelet, only a plate. I E-mailed Harris Michael to ask how I could purchase a chain to adapt and was never answered. Then I E-mailed to ask how to return the product. I had to E-mail twice. I finally received a reply and was promised a full refund 3 days after they received the product. That was in September and I still have not received credit on my AX. I am very dissatisfied with this company and will never purchase anything from them again as the company does not seem to care one bit about customer satisfaction. I have given it up as a lost cause. I already purchased another product which satified me. I not only was displeased with the product, but I am also displeased with the company's customer service."
0,Not worth half the cost,"Wheel weld sheared off after 4 hours of use. Middle plate that holds the axles sheared off after 5 hours of use. Machine was used behind JD garden tractor with ""normal"" usage and failed after 4-5 hours. Took it back and bought the JD for twice as much, but the construction is FAR superior."
0,Not the movies just a snippet of clips,Thought this was all the movies 1-5. It was a 30 second clip that wasn't even a summary of the films
1,A Great Creation,"Usually I like female authors , but the topic of the book, and its setting is truly suited to a male author . It was so well written, that I called in sick to work so that I can finish the last 200 pages. It has kept me awake nights till I finished it . and for you book lovers, you know that the true measure of a book, is how long in the night it keeps you awake. The only initial let down is my fondness for the speech mannerism of medieval England, which was not reflected here, but surprisingly I got over that soon enough. Follett has one more fan I guess."
0,"Over priced, lacking features","I bought it because Otter Box makes a waterproof case for it and together they make a low priced waterproof MP3 player. The Otter Box is great. If not for the Otter Box and my desire to be able to swim with it, I would choose something else. For the same money one can buy one from Creative. The Creative one has a display, uses standard AAA batteries, allows one to play music by album,skip albums or just find a particular song or album, which without a display the Shuffle is incapable of doing. The switch on the back does not have a good detent to allow choosing between shuffle and sequential play. If you only want to hear music in random order, do not desire to see what is playing, have to use one internal battery which needs a USB cord or special charger to charge, buy the Shuffle. Otherwise, think about a Nano or some other MP3 player."
0,i hate the boss,i hate the boss. i loved this movie...the original with Bob Seger soundtrack. the boss ruined this movie for me.
0,Never buy from this seller,"As with the other poor victims of this false vendor, I have not received my product. Luckily there is the A-Z from amazon. Never buy from this person, ever. You will not get your product and the process to file a claim takes a while for results to show."
0,Didn't work,"We bought this product because our dog was infested with fleas, and we still had to wait to give him Frontline for this month. We sprayed his whole body and I massaged it in as recommended. Well, it didn't work. The next day he was an infested as before. And I think he had some sort of allergic reaction to it: the skin on his testicles was peeling off. Don't waste your time and money."
0,This is a plain crap,"Well, well, well.I went to they concert ones, oh my god. I still have a headache till the present day. I thought that I came to psych hospital facility instead of concert.This is not a music. It can't be called rock or metal or anything else. This is a noise for people who are using drugs on daily basis. These Korn guys looks like on high doses also. And they have no talent at all, just hit the strings, and synth does the rest. Also listen to lyrics, my goodness, where we go? Hopefully great musicians like Dio, Iron Maiden and others still exist."
1,"Fun, Bouncy, Energetic","The tunes on the disc are fun, bouncy, and energetic. While some of the grooves did get pretty repetitive it is good music to listen to while you're working on things or working out."
0,Chair gel cushion,Not what I thought it was going to be. I assumed it was as advertised already filled with gel. I had to add water and it's just not what I thought it was to be.
0,Awful with dangerous exercises,"Simply put, this book is absurd. The diet prohibits fruit and bread, assuring failure down the road, as for any quick fix. I had to laugh at the ridiculous exercises in the book -- pushups off a big balance ball, both stupid and dangerous. Leaning forward holding the ball -- just GREAT for the back. My recommendation is to avoid any author with excessively white teeth."
0,So disappointed...,"I love the Dr. Who series. Unfortunately, this special is really bad. It's way beyond the ""little bit cheesy"" that I expected; it's simply too ridiculous to enjoy. Poor direction, poor storytelling, and an overall disappointment."
1,This is not a game to pass up!,"I bought this game a month ago thinking it was just a Bedazzled-type of game. As I started to play, it turned out to be a RPG with a Bedazzled-type of battle. I fell in love with it from that moment. And I am still playing it.I would highly recommend this game to anyone and everyone. It's worth every penny I bought it for. :)"
0,First time I have been disappointed,"Intially I was very excited to see this fluffy pink mirror--every little girl's dream--and then it went down hill from there--I am returning this product--it didn't work , the item was damaged, and the item box was trashed--also had all of the above been good--it was overpriced"
1,good quality good price,works very well. used it a hundred times already! lol. the green n red light work for only the first 2 u make then u have to check the sandwiches. duno if its a timer thing or what. but very good product!
0,THIS IS NOT QUEEN,"There is no QUEEN without Freddie Mercury. NO OTHER singer is/was and most likely ever be as great FREDDIE. He can never, NEVER be replaced. Plus John Decon isn't with band that's NOT QUEEN. I miss QUEEN and will always love their music, it has been the soundtrack to my life. But Paul Rogers? get the f*** out. I gave it 2 stars because Brian May is one of the best ever but they disrepecet the band that was QUEEN by not calling themself something like ""QUEEN TRIBUTE BAND"""
1,SO EXCITED to have this cd again!,"I grew up on acapella music and sang acapella for years. This group is AWESOME! Some of the members of this group were in a group called ""The Music Makers"" many years ago and they were AMAZING then. It was really great to know that they were still singing and had fine tuned their musical abilities. If you like acapella music, you will LOVE this cd!"
1,Good shaver,"Although I strongly prefer to shave with an electric shaver, I've never found one which shaves as close as a razor blade. This one is no exception -- but, nevertheless, it does give a close comfortable shave. I like -- and recommend -- it."
0,Not universal.,"The page claims that the mount is universal for flat-panel televisions within the size/weight range. This is not the case. The mount comes with a compatibility list, from which my 42"", 90lb television is absent. The mount was neither tall enough nor wide enough to fit. Compatibility should be listed on the page.This mount WILL NOT fit a Toshiba 42hp66, 42"" plasma television without excessive reeingineering.The mount does, however, seem well made."
1,Black Lion Ben Webster,"For my money, the Black Lion sessions of Ben Webster are the most enjoyable recordings that I have by this wonderful tenor. The sound is very alive and has character. The selections represent most of the song book that he played in his late career.The whole trio plays very well behind him. These recordings were made at the Monmarte in Denmark.Get all three before they are gone. You will not regret it. i had them on LP from the 1970's, and I paid more for them back then--especially volumes 2 and 3 which I had to import from England.There are approximately 5-7 volumes of Monmartre recordings of Dexter Gordon from the late 60's that are great too!"
1,Important early book by a principal in the case,"As the leading civilian expert on the Secret Service, I recommend this book from former Dallas Police Chief Jesse Curry, who rode in the lead car of the fateful Dallas motorcade on 11/22/63 (and who believed there was a gunman on the grassy knoll, among other tantalizing thongs). There are several gems in this book. Well worth your money.Vince PalamaraSecret Service expert, History Channel, author of two books, in over 32 other author's books, etc."
1,Love it!,"I love this movie, always have. The acting is superb and it's wonderfully creepy. What an excellent price for a blu ray. Gotta love Amazon!"
0,an anti-Catholic fantasy trivializing actual Catholic Exorcism,"Peter Blatty in my opinion, sold his pretend-fantasy about Exorcism, describing such in ways that dont even come close to the reality of Exorcism, which is profound and real in the Church. He sells out Catholic Church teachings about exorcism by making trivial and shallow assertions about it all. The church doesnt revolve around a guy who didnt make his hash marks as a writer with his one effort... it was the film maker who put the fantasy of 'exorcist' into pop culture, and the film is different than the book and shows true genius in film making. Regarding Blatty's writings trivializing exorcism, his book cant be put ahead of the real Christ that the real Church revolves around solely. In that way, the Exorcist book is uninformed and inaccurate in its ""facts"" about exorcism. The book is entertainment, but not in any way a serious portrayal of what is."
1,Sole problem is no way to lock it off,"Considering the size, cost and convenience, the audio quality is excellent. I've carried it around for interviews for podcasts and they are fine.The iPod scroll wheel can control the recording unit, so a separate start/stop button is not required on the iTalk. Unfortunately it's there, though, and the iPod lock switch does NOT override it. So you cannot keep it assembled and at the ready because it's forever turning itself on and draining the battery, recording hours of unwanted background noise. It's like having a camera that you have to take the film out of after every shot.If the iPod software can be upgraded so the lock switch locks out this button, the utility of the device would be greatly improved."
1,Deeply Moving Book,"This book helps address children's fears. It could also help a child talk about the death of a loved one. ""But what if you die?"" asks the child in the book at the end. ""My love doesn't die, it stays with you, as warm as two pairs of mittens on top of each other. When you remember you and me, you say: 'What can I do with so much love?'""So you love thunder and lightning, dogs and snakes. You dance with other people in the leaves, and are in plays with them. You love them, and they love you, and you eat raisins together.""""So will it be okay?""""Yes, my love, it will."""
0,Once,This is not very intresting. I only used it a few times and i got it for my birthday. It's over priced.
0,Terrible Product!,"First of all...do not purchase this as a gift for someone (as it was purchased for us) - even though it says you get a ""free"" tadpole - you still have to pay $8 or so shipping. So with the purchase of a couple tadpoles, this turns into $45 junk instead of $25 junk. I went ahead and ordered...after 6 months of not receiving them I called. They claim they mailed it to the wrong address (I have good reason not to believe them). After getting the second batch, one was dead in 12 hours the other died a day later. Directions were followed explicitly and I have previous experience raising reptiles and fish. I was told I was getting a refund, let's see how long THAT takes...This was a very disappointing experience."
0,A fun read...but,"Every review after this loves the book,and I do not fault them. If you like over the top empty mysteries this is a good book. If you like the Garret files, this is only fair. Green likes to write large flashy and in two dimensions. That writing always has the potential to be a fun read, but not a good read. Like the rest of the series this is a fun book. It's no Dresden files, and it could almost make the young reader's section, but it's fun."
1,Hasn't Lost Any Of It's Power..,"The best documentary series EVER. I originally saw this as a kid in the UK, when it was first screened in the mid-70's on ITV on Sunday afternoons. Those unforgettable B+W images of a time only 30 years gone made a massive impact on me back then.So naturally I wondered if re-watching this series again now might show it all to be badly dated in the post-MTV age. I couldn't have been more wrong. Just seeing the combination of those haunting opening credits along with Olivier's haunting human narration and Carl Davis's moving score all over again felt like a punch in the stomach. In these dark violent times, this wonderful humanitarian series chronicling possibly the only worthy war in mankind's history hasn't dated a bit. Indispensable stuff."
0,Wasted effort,After searching online reviews I settled on the PXC 450 headphones. Spent extra to express mail these headphones so I would have them on a cross country flight Florida to Seattle in two days. Opened the box tonight and found the headphones do not work - even used new batteries other than the ones included in the kit. Hopefully I can get another set overnight - otherwise all the music in my Iphone not be heard on this trip.
0,"Good songs,Bad dancn","Britney's song's are ok but her danc'n, She dont know how to dance! After she did her surgery she can barely move. i think the new singer Christina Agularia will beat ""Baby 1 More Time"" My favs. songs are Crazy and Sometimes."
1,Great addition to a music library,A few of Shostakovich's more obscure piano gems are included in this album. Ashkenazy's interpretation of these pieces is excellent.
0,THE DVD HAS BEEN CUT PEOPLE!,"Great film-would normally give it 5 stars. But as others have NOTED it has been cut. Thus I'm at a loss reading reviews from folks who claimed to have seen it in the theaters(I did) and give it high marks-The most important single line in the movie- the line that makes the movie AND THE ENDING--when Rip Thorn points to the rifle and says that is the gun that did it (aka shot Kennedy) IS MISSING. I can only assume they lost the Master Negative and just used an existing print for the DVD and that print had damage at some point and was missing the line....Totally incredible-the one line that makes the movie, makes the ending and it is missing. Like an idiot I threw away my VHS copy before watching the DVD.."
0,"Only 2 pages (#100,101) were worth reading, & they were good","Interviews of abnormal women the author presents as normal. Per this book almost every woman is heavily into BDSM (bondage, dominance, sado mashochism). It's nonesense! Pages 100 & 101 have some good practical advice, but that's it."
1,Tuscan Milk's Freshness Can't Stay,"A Tuscan cow's first milk is gold,Her hardest liquid to hold.Her early Tuscan milk is 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz.But only fresh when in houses.Then milk subsides to sour,So Tuscany sank from power,So sourness turns to decayTuscan milk's freshness can't stay."
0,Printer Drops the Ball,"I pre-ordered this book as its topic was of great interest to me professionally. Sadly I had to return it due to a major error by the printer in which pages 11-42 were missing. Even with the missing material this is a very short book at only 138 pages (without the end matter and notes) in a small format of 8"" x 5"". My negative review is not a reflection on the author and the quality of his research and writing, but instead on the printer who made such a glaring error that went to market unnoticed. I still look forward to reading this book, but will want to lay my hands on a copy to make sure its complete before buying it."
1,Not a Senor Coconut/Atom Heart CD,"Senor Coconut fans should note that this is NOT the new Atom Heart/Senor Coconut cd. Instead, it's a various-artists cd compiled by Senor Coconut, featuring quirky electronic funk/reggaeton/cumbia artists from Chile, Brasil, Argentina and Panama. Still, it's quite enjoyable. Many of the tracks remind me of latin versions of 2 Live Crew or Lady Sovereign."
0,Threw it away.,"In my 63 years on this earth and the thousands of books I have read, thisis literally the only book I not only did not finish reading, but the only book I threw away without donating it either to charity or even to recycle - it went into the landfill as garbage. And that was just after reading the first chapter."
0,Good points but not for everyone,"A great read. Very thought provoking. However, I was taught from a very young age that you never, ever casually open someone else's refrigerator and take food without asking. It doesn't matter if its the refrigerator of close family or your best friend. It's bad manners and very disrespectful. So the idea of ""Refrigerator Rights"" doesn't resonate with me AT ALL. Though the points in this book make sense in today's world, not everyone enjoys being around a lot of people and that doesn't mean such people are ""limited"" in how much enjoyment they get out of life. I took exception to the author's apparent belief that self-reliance is bad. You can't always lean on others."
0,The smell is intolerance,"When I'first get the pad, The smell is extremely awful. I thought it might be better after a day or two. But the offend odor is still there, even when I put it in the passage that air can circulate for couple days. The material is not fit for anything used near human or alive things."
0,Herbie full of it.,Well the originals were amazing. This one was full of graphics and the originals never had all those stupid human like antics on the car. To me it could have been a lot better especially without all the dumb car antics but that is just me.
1,molto buono!!!,"If you have ever been to Italy, if you are Italian (100% or 8%), if you've ever known anybody Italian or eaten Italian food, this tome will shed light & help make sense of this beautiful country and her idiosyncratic inhabitants. A first edition paperback graced my grandparent's bookshelf since as far back as I can remember (30+ years). I took it home after my grandma (an Italian immigrant) passed away at the age of 97. I haven't been able to put it down since. If you're Italian, this book just verbalizes what you've known or at least suspected your whole life. If your not Italian, then you will probably say to yourself many times over, ""that explains a lot!""Happy reading!Viva Italia!"
1,Fun workout,You get actually 3 workouts on this DVD. the first one is 1-1/2 hour but actually has a break after the first 60 minutes so you can quit then or keep going or just do the last 1/2 hour and then there a separate 30 minute fat burning workout as well. I sometimes do the entire 90 minute but sometimes I break them up. The 30 minute fat burning workout is good too. They must have the workout rooms temperature turned way up because I barely break out in a sweat with the 30 minute workouts on Taebo and everyone on the video is soaking wet.
1,Jules Vernes follow up!,"If you like disney's 20'000 Leagues under the sea then you will definetly want to add this to your collection. I love all of Ray Harryhausen's movies and this is no exception this movie version is rare in that it is actually better than the book!! Charles Schneer and Ray Harryhausen were a incomprable team and anyone would be proud to own every movie they did together you will not find high adventure on such a wholesome level as the movies done by Ray Harryhausen and Charles Schneer they bring your child great adventure without a over saturation of violence, sex & the ever popular f-bomb these are movies that truely deliever because they are strong on story line and short on smut and as far as i'm conscerned the special effects still stand up well today often lending a sort of surealism that enhances the movie. In short they just do'nt make e'm like this any more!!!"
0,HP DVD+R 8x is a very bad product,I bought 4 50-pack HP DVD+R 8x media spindles and used them to back up my computer data. Only 1 out of 5 disks worked with minor glitches. All 4 others failed miserably. Data corruption is the major problem with this product.
0,very thin plastic,This pool ripped on the first day on grass. We used the patch but it still leaks air. Every time we use it we have to add more air. Very thin.
0,Yawn...,"Rather than attempt to develop a plot, after delivering the initial hooks of characterization, Winterson proceeds to muddle around in their depressingly disorganized perspectives of modern life. The characters' only hope, it seems, is somehow finding a way to express themselves in their dire conditions, all of which have something to do with sex. If there were some way of expressing how contrived the bleakness of the world and the situations they encounter, how flat and boring the characters are, and how ""random"" the thought and phrase juxtapositions are... Well. I would. Alas, the only real way to experience this psychobabble is to pick it up for yourself. If you're miserable and looking for company, or a college student who has to read this for class, :kaff: pick it up."
1,Great Family Movie,"Really loved the movie. Is a wonderful movie to sit and watch with the family. The dogs are totally lovable and cute, wanted to adopt all of them. Would recommend this movie to others."
0,BORING!,"Being intrigued by human exploration of Mars and coupled with the fact that this book was a Nebula Award winner, I eagerly purchased ""Red Mars"" and the other two books in the series. Big mistake! Halfway through the book and bored to tears, I quit reading it - something I NEVER do. In fact, this book was so bad that I decided instead to paint my house.If you are looking for a good hard sci-fi book on Mars, try Ben Bova's ""Mars."" In the meantime, I will be trading in my Robinson books for some improvement reading - maybe a Mack Bolan book....."
1,OK intro to QM,"This is a pretty decent introduction to QM. Not many prereqs are assumed which is good. Ch. 4 is organized a bit strangely (angular momentum is presented after the hydrogen atom). However, you will probably have to read a more advanced book to move on to QFT."
1,THANKS~!,THE BEST MINI SERIES IN A LONG TIME ~!! This is such a great REALITY show - much better than all the junk they call reality shows on TV - This is REAL LIFE DRAMA - I was amazed to 'get it' that Human Beings always struggle with the same issues across the boundaries of time~! I think this is the the Best show since the 80's when we had Dynasty and Dallas... THANK YOU!!
0,These do chip,"We also have several different versions of these glasses. Many have the color chipping off. My wife is quite disappointed with this, although she really liked the overall quality and design."
0,ring roller not woth it save your money,The proline ring roller I recieved was delivered very fast. The machine knurls drive roller wore out the first couple of pieces of metal that I ran though. Upon further use the rollers are not parallel so no matter what you do the piece formed will always have a twist to it. Save your money and time and keep looking for other machines because this one is not worth ordering.
0,Not the Greatest,"The inverter worked once, then failed altogether. Radio is cheesy. Jump start power works but is relatively weak. Charge indicator lights are funky and innacurate. The price is cheap for a reason."
0,Well written Shmaltz,"I loved Bees and I am so disappointed! Although the imagery is wonderful, it gets old after awhile. I got tired of the protagonist wallowing in all her cliched 40 something feelings of despair and emptiness. Erotic? I don't think so. It was like reading Danielle Steele at her shmaltziest.I was irritated that the protagonist's plain old honest to goodness lack of maturity was portrayed as soul searching, and that a suicide would be viewed as anything other than a coward's way out. Because I like to believe that there are some elimental truths about life and spirituality, this story completely rubbed me the wrong way. All the main characters were victimized by one thing or another and I would have liked to see at least one of them realize that, as an adult, being a victim is a choice."
1,Great for casual use,"I have purchased this kits several times over the past several years to use with my middle school students. I have never had issues with the thickness, and properly cared for designs last up to two weeks with lovely, rich color. It is not a professional product, and the tip isn't small enough to do super-fine, detailed work, but it is a well-priced kit to have fun with with your friends or kids."
1,Very Good Condition,"I loved the product. The video worked well and there were no problems, it was just very expensive for a DVD. Love the video though!"
1,WOW !,"Just when I thought it couldn't get any better, here comes Ta Da. Jennie outshines herself on her second release. Two songs from the CD, ""Away"" and ""Forward in Time"" are fimilar songs to her fans, having played them live prior to this release. What I find unique about those songs are how subtle changes were made on the CD and it was like finding a forgotten Christmas gift while taking down the tree. What fun ! Check out her gutsy performance on ""Love Don't Come Around"" as well as ""Somebody's Daughter"". In fact the entire CD is full of great vocals, songwriting, a great band and guest musicians. Jennie, you rock ! They do say that it's impossible to wear out CD's...right ?"
0,Poor quality,Poor quality thermometer and humidity gauge. What do you expect for the price? I expect it to at least be close to accurate. I have a digital for about a dollar more that works great. This one is hard to see and inaccurate.
0,I really wanted to like this!,"To give you some background info., I am a fitness instructor and I take cross-fit and boot-camp style classes all of the time. When I popped this in my DVD player, I was very disappointed. Not only does the instructor move a bit too fast for a DVD, the movements are a bit ridiculous (Imagine there are five circles on the ground and move in this direction and imagine you are jumping through tires, etc.). I would save your money and go to YouTube and look up boot-camp workout videos or check out BodyRock.tv for some real instructing."
0,Title,"This product was awful and a waste of my time, effort, and excitment. It only worked for about 5 or 6 minutes the first couple times I used it, then stopped working all together. iRobot was very difficult to work with."

1,simply too funny,"I fell asleep in the recliner while watching a t.v. movie, and woke to this marvelous, funny, belly laugh, movie.I laughed until my sides ached and regretted that I missed the very first part of this movie. So.......I simply had to have it. It is definitely not for family viewing, but it is NOT a gross experience. In fact, I almost fell out of the recliner laughing. This movie is a must have."
0,Oh shut the hell up Nirvana fans.....,"Everybody, EVERYBODY is sick of Nirvana & Nirvana fans. at one point in time, nobody really cared, & lots more even LIKED nirvana... but now EVERYONE IS SICK OF NIRVANA AND HOW MUCH CREDIT THEY GET!!!! Nirvana does NOT deserve as much credit as the Cure, or Pearl Jam, or ALice in Chains, or the Smashing Pumpkins! down with Nirvana, everyone is so incredibly SICK & even DISGUSTED with them by now, just shut up about them, this album is NOTHING compared to ANY of the Cure's albums, and Pearl Jam's albums, thats a fact"
1,"""War is a nasty business""","This excellent mini-series tells the story of RAF Hornet Squadron, from their frustration during the ""Phony War"" to the deadly air combat over England. This movie succeeds where the 1969 movie ""Battle of Britain"" failed. Don't get me wrong, I like ""Battle of Britain"", but the characters in this are developed so that you get to know each one (although they die off rather quickly). As the war progresses, some of the pilots go nuts, some become hard-hearted, and others simply go numb and follow orders blindly. My favorite character is the cynical ""Moggy"" (played by Neil Dudgeon), who always has a negative sarcastic comment to say! There's enough humor, romance, and especially action to keep anyone entertained from beginning to end. The airiel photography is awesome and really captures the beauty of the Spitfire, one of the finest fighter planes of all time. This movie is highly recommended."
0,Not a good buy!!!,"The watch manufacturer states that the watch is water proof up to 100 meters. Well, I went swimming in a 5 feet depth swimming pool and to my surprise the watch allowed water to get inside of it. This is a new watch that I bought here at Amazon, came in a new box, and the watch seemed like it never had been used before. I had to pull the knob for the watch to start for the first time. I am not very pleased with this buy at all!!!. since, it is not water resistant as mentioned by the manufacturer. Buyer be ware!!"
0,Get aTIVO,"I bought a Tivo for my son for Christmas and a RePlay for myself. Loved the RePlay when I first got it. I especially liked the fact that I could network it instead of hooking it to a phone line. And it seemed easier to set up then the Tivo. However getting your REBATE from these guys is like next to impossible. You are missing this item and then that item,then your Activation key doesn't show up in their database even when I have been having service for the last 4 months and getting billing emails from them. Got the TIVO rebate in 6 weeks. Finally sent the last letter to them with a copy of my monthly bill, telling them if they can't get it right I will probably cancel service soon and get a Tivo. A week later they billed me for the next month and 2 days after that( a week after the warranty was done) my RePlay died, the AV plugs ins will not take a Video signal in. I now can only replay my Basic cable no pay services. Save your money and get a TIVO!"
0,Giggle!,"Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!!!! Oh that soulmate guy Illiana is soooo cute!!! I wish I could run away with him, unlike mundane reality, where nothing like this happens!!!! Get real. This book is too Disney-esque. For once, I would like to see an unhappy ending; i.e. the soulmate dies. Like Tolstoy said, ""All happy endings are the same, but unhappy endings are unhappy in their own way."" =)"
0,Need to stop the racial stereotypes...,"The book would have been okay except for some of the racial stereotypes. Why did the author feel the need to make it clear when the character was speaking with an african-american, yet never distinguished when the characters were speaking to other races. Were we to assume all the other characters were white???"
1,What a thriller,"I had doubts about Daniel Craig being 007, but after seeing Casino Royale, I think he is the best one yet. I saw it 2 times at the theatre,although the second time, I could not endure to sit through the ""chair"" scene again; I went for popcorn."
1,"GREAT,!!! I love it","This is a great lunch box!!! I lived in Japan for a while and left my old one over there, because I had to much stuff to bring back. This was the perfect replacement. It keeps food warm for HOURS. Its also a great way to help cut back on your food portions. Only 2 complaints.......that the middle bowl may leak if not tightend properly. Also, I now work as a flight attendant and its not a practical lunch box to take with me on my trips.......because its slightly bulky and can only take at least 2 days worth of food if u pack it right. Other than that, its great"
0,dangerous step in her career,"this album was very weak, Emotions was the only good song. If she hadn't released the MTV unplugged CD and worked hard on Music Box to have it become her best selling album ever, she would have become a flash in the pan after her first self titled CD, but it's 15 years after that and mariah is still making good music, keep it up girl!"
1,"Hilarious, classic, You can't tell where it's going.","What a great film. Kirk Douglas has the hand up on the Warden played by Henry Fonda, but you never know who will win. The two actors play back and forth with pranks and hilarious lines. This is a classic western comedy! Anyone who likes John Wayne films will love it. The ending is so good I cannot spoil it for you now. Every home should add this copy to it's westerns. My favorite thing about the movie is that while Kirk Douglas thinks he is sly, the Warden proves to be even more cunning. Just another story to prove, ""Crime doesn't Pay"""
0,Horrible battery,"Would never buy this battery again! Very short run time, about 40 minutes, before needing recharging."
0,How to make money at the expense of others...,"Building A Mystery: The Story of Sarah McLachlan and Lilith Fair, Judith Fitzgerald's pathetic first foray into the world of the unauthorised biography, might easily have been titled: ""How to Make Money at the Expense of Others"". This is simply another trashy tell-all that abounds in sale bins at your local bookstore. Fitzgerald makes Sarah out to be some evil beast of a woman who kills anyone who gets in her way. It's pointless to read a book that was only written asa vehicle to strike back at Sarah and her management for whatever imagined slights Judith Fitzgerald feels they've perpetrated against her."
0,Body Farm--a total yawn,"Somewhat exciting but essentially empty. It made me ask myself why I even read Cornwell books at all. It's just ""CSI"" in book form, with gratutitous adultery, cross-dressing and homosexuality thrown in for shock value. The story wasn't even woven together as tightly as an episode of ""CSI."" Why spend 3 hours reading this stuff when you can watch the same kind of story in 60 minutes then use the other two hours having a real life.Not the worst book I ever read, but close enough."

1,"Great Hardware, the software is old, but now can be upgraded!","I've used this device as my main PDA for a couple years now, and I like it quite a bit. The hardware is quite nice, it is sad that Palm stopped progressing with PalmOS. The good news is, thanks to hackers like the people at [...], you can now easily put your own software on the Palm TX. You can already put OpenMoko on it, and I'll bet soon you'll be able to run Android on it.If you want to try yourself, I've been working on making it easy to do.

0,Doesn't work with the iPhone!,"This splitter was listed as iPhone compatible on the Apple site, but it's not. Maybe in a future version it will be, but the one I got mid-July 2007 doesn't fit into the plug on the iPhone which is what I wanted. :-("
0,THEY GUTTED THIS BOOK!!!,"After receiving an audiobook for Christmas and enjoying it, I decided to listen to some of my favorite books while driving to work. I accidently bought the abridged version of Outlander. I thought they would only edit it a little so I opened it and listened to the first CD. The book is completely ruined in my opinion. They took out all the lovely backgground people and places. Plus the sex! After listening to the first CD, I bought the unabridged version which is 28 cds instead of 8. The new one is wonderful. It makes me want to get into the car to go to work! I will never buy an abridged version again!!"
0,...without Judith Durham??,"I almost bought this ... then looked again when I saw that there was a different lead singer. I grew up with this music and it's till wonderful but it's Durham's voice, beautiful, subtle and clear as a bell, that can still give me goosebumps. 'Never Find Another You' is a great song by any stretch of the imagination but it's that voice that lifts it to another level. They will never find another Judith Durham - so why bother."
1,Love saving money making my own cards,I've been using these for years. You save so much money and people love getting customized cards. Very thoughtful and special.
0,Be Careful!,More memory is not better. This card does not work in most of our computers. It's too big! Didn't work in some Celeron and Athlon computers. Try the 256K instead.
0,my ferret wouldnt eat this treat,"My ferret would not even touch this treat. she smelled it and refused to eat, and she is not a picky eater. i tried again to give her the treat but she never ate a single one. I will be going back to her old treats."
0,Thumbs down,"The Alesis io|2 failed to work properly under Windows XP w/ Cakewalk Home Studio 6. The result was two-fold:1: playback was an octave higher than recording -- which can be fixed if you remember to (manually) set the sample rates accordingly. This problem occurred in Sonar Home Studio 6, Cubase LE 1, and Window's ""sound recorder"" app.2: in Cakewalk, regardless of varied ASIO buffer settings, recording was garbled and filled with static.I was able to duplicate the problem in two different XP environments: one under an HP dv8000 with Media Center Home Edition, and another with IBM thinkpad t60p w/ XP professional (both with ample RAM and CPU).After 6 months of troubleshooting and support calls to Cakewalk and Alesis, I bought the Edirol UA-25EX audio interface, and it worked perfectly upon the first attempt. No need to adjust sample rates or ASIO buffers."
0,Waste of Money.,"This stud finder is virtually useless. Inaccurate readings galore. I now wish I'd have spent the extra money and gotten a better product. After numerous attempts, you get different readings for studs and the AC sensor went off constantly. Apparently my entire home is full of wires from ceiling to floor.(note sarcasm) Better off trying better quality."
1,Even better than Season 1,This is my favorite season of Slayers. The whole gang is back and hilarious as ever. And the ending is brilliant! Love it!
1,Very beautiful,Amazing colors and catches the light with both gentle and profoud reflections. I even bought two to balance an entry way outside my home. Fabulous product.
0,No benefit,"Well herbal supplements are a very personal experience aren't they? For me, this did nothing which is very surprising because my body is super sensitive to everything i put on it or in it so i usually feel something, good or bad but with this, just nothing really. So i stopped taking it. At least there were no bad side effects...."
0,Where did Madonna go?,Maybe the answer would be...Buddah Buddah Land? Maybe just in the path of a really tasteless album? It contains songs with too much image and too little depthness. The album is miles and miles from reality. Just like the Madonna we now know.
0,Not worth the money,"I purchased this kettle 3 years ago. The whistle is great, the handle is fine. The problem that my husband and I have is with the lid. The lid forms such a strong seal that it is almost impossible to lift the lid without a peice of it breaking off.The inside became rusty as well. Looks great, not worth the money."
0,Not worth it.,"I like Crispin Glover and i am a huge horror and genre fan, but this movie was weak, really weak. I like movies sometimes that are bad, because they are bad in a way that is funny or even enjoyable. This was a movie that was bad and after it was over I say ""I just wasted an hour and a half (or however long it was) of my life on this crap!"""
1,very cool illusion,"This product uses two parabolic mirrors to create the illusion of a small object (e.g. a penny) floating above the object's actual location. The resulting image is very clear and sharp, and can be viewed from a reasonable range of angles. I found that the mirror scratched easily, hence the lower mark for durability; otherwise it is pretty rugged. A quibble: because the illusion is produced with mirrors it is incorrect to refer to it as a hologram, which is produced by interference."
0,just not fun,"for various reasons already mentioned I find the game arduous and not enjoyable, the experience (even with the self touted situational awareness) is static and nothing about the game environment is immersing, it's just frustrating, and the feel is clumsy."
0,Bait & Switch,I bought the kindle to read the wsj @ 9.99/mos. While my kindle was in transit to me they upped the price of the journal to $15/mos. Unreal.
1,Worth the price,Used it a couple weeks ago and it went up easy and was plenty big enough for 2 adults. Only small complaint is that the bag it comes in is a little small when it comes to taking it down.
1,A MUST FOR ANYONE WITH A FAMILY( EVERYONE),"Well, let me start by saying the book is great, but be careful why you're reading it, the book will take you to a rollercoaster ride as you start identifying your own childhood issues, as in my case,my therapist recommended I read it, But get prepared emotionally to cry, to vent outwith a friend, to take it slowly, because I started having a bad reactionon the first couple of chapters, why I say is great, because all of us have issues to work through and hopefully in the case of people who have children you dont repeat this pattern with them, in my case I dont, but this book gave me much needed knowledge to understand the mistakes my parents made, how I can heal, and how to notdo this to my kids the day I have them."
0,Uhg,"What a stinky... yucky... pootchie movie. I mean... ew. Really. Just... ew. It was horrible. The only reason people watch this is for... I dunno. ""Sex appeal."" Do not watch it for the story line. Never buy it as a gift. Just my opinion, and a damn good one for that matter. Toodles. *uhg* DOESN'T EVEN DESERVE THAT STAR THEY MADE ME PUT. Yeah...."
0,THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE ! ! ! !,Do not watch this one. A complete waste of time. Watch DUPLEX instead.
1,"Hate, lust, synapses and oral arguments!","Not the Clinton scandal, but Richard Doolings latest journey into the small, dark crevices of the soul and brain. While I didn't enjoy this as much as White Man's Grave, nobody gives one as much information in so entertaining a way as Mr. Dooling. This book is almost like going through your first year of law school without being subjected to the Socratic method. Who would have thought so much was happening in St. Louis, of all places. Sure the main character is kind of a wimp and the ending takes an altogether too nice of a tone, but there are plenty of thrills along the way."
0,Terrible!!,"This movie was terrible. The plot is terrible, the acting was not good, and the plot was terrible. This movie was just retarded."
0,As the Galaxy Turns,"USE OF WEAPONS (1990 - reprinted 2008) is a ""Space Opera"" far-future SciFi novel, that is part of the Bank's ""Culture"" series.I found the book to be exceedingly dull... it reminded me of watching TV Soap Operas - which I simply don't have any use for either. I couldn't care less about the characters, nor the story.The story and style of writing reminds me of Asimov's ""Foundation Trilogy"" series from the 1950's, but updated to be more ""sexually racy"" for the 1990's audience. Asimov was breaking new ground in the 50's... but this novel adds nothing new, technology-wise."
0,The Red Army could not attack in 1941,"I read Icebreaker a few years after it came out and dismissed it for being an interesting view but not backed up by the facts. A friend said the debate continues and looking at these reviews I see it is true. Do NOT believe what is stated in this book. Ask for facts. The 29 Soviet Mechanized Corps on the border were a shambles. Readiness was below 40% in most and training was a disaster. This alone refutes the premise of icebreaker. David Glantz, the greatest Soviet military historian, flatly refutes icebreaker in his book, 'Stumbling Colossus'. Read 'Stumbling Colossus' if you want to know the truth about Red Army readiness and capability on 22 June 1941. Leave icebreaker for high school children and the gullible."
0,Doesn't work...,"Just bought this for my 8-year old. Doesn't work. I love Elenco products, typically. The unit is lightweight and seems sturdy enough, but it flat out does not work. Returning tomorrow."
1,Awesome!,This movie kept me laughing threw the entire thing. It even makes you tear up and feel good. I love this movie.
0,Poor quality and unstable,Would not recommend this. I bought 6 or 3 sets. 2 of 6 were wobbly and unstable. Can be dangerous.
0,Dense prose and opinions not backed up with evidence,This book provides a lot of food for thought but not much that would help yo to accept his thesis. This is another of those books using scare tactics to make you think that memes are spead primarily by infectious agents and you had better watch out because they are often harmful. I ended up believing less than half of what he had to say but feeling that he had given me a lot of things to look into and check out for myself. He did not provide me with many resources with which to do it
0,"Kinda drags, but overall an okay read","I read this book before reading any of her other ones (i.e. Slightly Single, which I believe comes before Slightly Engaged)...and unfortunately it left me questioning if I was going to read any more of them! Sure, when it wasn't dragging and repeating itself it was a good read. It really did have its moments. But boy, did it drag. I feel like every 4th sentence was was some version of ""Maybe he'll proposed today,"" and it really dragged at times. Still, if you don't mind skimming every so often, give it a try and a rainy day when you have nothing else to do."
0,Great product-- for a little while,"This was my second Nomad Jukebox, and I should have learned after the first one. The first was a 10GB player that I bought in June of 03. It lasted EXACTLY 6 months before freezing up on me. No amount of tech support would bring it back to life. I said, well, I guess i will just spend the extra cash and get an ipod.The low price of the Nomad 30GB seduced me. I picked one up instead of the pod, and I loved it, for about 6 months. Then the headphone jack stopped working. Luckily, this time I got the service plan, so when my refund check arrives, I am off to buy... an Ipod."
0,Save your money,"There are many more shoot em up movies that are more fun to watch, this one goes in circles I didn't enjoy it"
0,Does Not fit all cars,"I have a GMC Yukon, and the product is too small for my exhaust.Therefore, unusable, as far as I can see."
0,a missed opportuntiy,"I have read all of Julie Garwood's books and looked forward to seeing one of them come to life. Sadly this was not to be. The highly forgetable actress who played Rose was overly pouty and did not resemble the strong and capable character of the book. While the cinematography was beautiful, the film was void of the depth of character of the novel. It seemed as though the scriptwriter could not allow Adam, the african-american Claymore to be as vital to the film as he was in the book. The ending, which included a senseless betrayal, the death of Cole and Rose settling for Fergus(none of which were in the book) was a tv movie whimp out. Perhaps, if it had been four hour film presentation there would have been time enough to tell the story in a way that truly honored Julie Garwood's wonderful work. Ditch the moive and READ THE BOOKS, as each brother had there own story."
1,Wow! You have to read this book.,It dosen't matter if your not intrested in war you will get caught up and you'll never be able to put it down. You must get the whole series and you'll read it and you'll like it.
0,Shouldn't have happened!,"This remake should never have been made. Almost all the characters are unlikeable and Michael Myers (as in the Halloween remake) isn't scary, which makes the movie not scary."
0,Maybe it will grow on me... but I doubt it,"There's nothing here but a departure to a crappy emo/pop sound including handclaps and other various misplaced garbage. A few catchy riffs don't make up for the lack of quality or energy of previous NFG releases. I guess a lot of great bands put out a turd of a CD once or twice and on this one, NFG dropped a stinker."
0,Turns Orange,"Pros-Smells great, moisturizing and it does give a subtle colorCons-The color however is on the orange side so it isn't all that different from other products(self-tanners) on the market and I would not describe it as a ""glow"" I would describe it as slightly orange color.Jergens Natural Glow works much better amd actually gives a natural looking glow and I highly recommend that instead. It does leave a slight shimmer, which may not be something everyone would like. They have a product for your face or you could just use the body lotion. It actually does give a healthy natural looking glow that doesn't look orange."
1,great old school black metal,"This is some very good stuff.There are many classic songs that can also be found on Melissa and some that are not on that album.""Nuns have no fun"" is a great song.This stuff was a good start for the band but i think that Dont Break The Oath was Mercyful Fates best album.And what is that other reviewer talking about comparing them to Christian Death?He says ""if you want some real GOTH/DEATH ROCK....."".If you think that Mercyful Fate is even trying to be a death rock band then you shouldnt even be reviewing this album.Although Christian Death with Rozz Williams was great.The mention of Christian Death has no place in a mercyful fate review.Anyway,Mercyful Fate is a lot better.Buy this CD."
0,Half-baked theory,"The book's extensive documentation of homosexuality in animals may be valuable, but the book's style doesn't leave me with much confidence that its interpretations of the research are sufficiently unbiased to be relied upon.The book's discussions of why it is hard to provide an evolutionary explanation of homosexuality are mostly reasonable, but the alternative to evolution that the book proposes isn't sufficiently well thought out to qualify as a testable scientific hypothesis. Evolutionary theory has a good enough track record at explaining things that appear at first glance to be counterproductive that people shouldn't reject it without finding an alternative with a good deal of explanatory power. But exuberance is an idea which explains very little. And anyone who has made impartial observations of typical natural ecosystems should see that the extravagance and waste that the book worships are sufficiently uncommon as to be hard to reconcile with the book's characterization."
0,American Pie,"The success of this movie leave one wondering...It does show that it does not take a lot to entertain people. The story is about a bunch of teenagers wanting to get laid, and their embarrasing experiences. The movie is very vulgar and relies completely on vulgar humor to get by. The movie DOES have a point but it is sadly lost among the gimmicks and jokes. The movie is highly overrated, I think. I will say only giggling teenagers can find this funny(or people with an incredible juvenile sense of humor). If you think a guy having sex with a pie, a guy drinking a beer that includes manly fluids is funny then this is definately for you."
1,Very snug,"I have a very small head and found these very snug. If you have a large head, you might find these too tight. This is probably good for serious hearing protection but such snugness is probably overkill for my purpose, which is mowing the lawn."
1,bongo drums :),i love these they were everything i wanted and more and recieved item very quickly would defiently order again :)
1,pretty good,"This book was a good size and takes about a week to read.It kept my attention more than the other Tolkien books,but makes the war sound a little too hopeless. He answers a few questions from the previous books and makes the fantasy world a bit more complete.i really enjoyed this one and recommend it to everyone. The part about the Valinor who are the next step from kings is interesting. One war was because the mortal men couldn't go to the deathless island of the elves or the valinor's island.So the men were pretty much on Saurons side the whole time and the Elves and dwarves on the other.The book is very creative and therearen't so many journeys"
0,Same Old Story,"Comparing the 2011 ""prequel"" to the 1982 original is like a masterclass in the difference between modern Hollywood and even the Hollywood of just a few decades ago.The Thing (1982) was a gory horror/sci-fi film aimed mostly at teens and nerds (or both, like me) but it has great performances, edgy dialogue, and truly frightening and disturbing scenes.The Thing (2011) has interchangeable characters who might as well not even have names, by-the-book CGI, no atmosphere, and no suspense. It barely even has the jump-scares that normally Hollywood can be expected to deliver.In 1982, Kurt Russell scraped hot wires in petri dishes of blood to divine who was a monster and who wasn't.In 2011, Flavor of the Month Actress #7209 shone a flashlight into the other characters' mouths to see if they had fillings to divine who was a monster and who wasn't.'Nuff said."
1,great,I had seen this movie when I was around 12 years old and I really wanted to see it again. I wanted to feel the excitement I felt then and believe me it was almost the same. Thank you for still bringing us something to remember.
1,"Bluegrass, But More...","This is one of my favorite albums of all time... I have it on vinyl and CD. The vocals are haunting and beautiful... Check out the title track. This album is bluegrass... but more. It achieves the near impossible task of allowing in non-traditional bluegrass instruments like piano, pedal steel and percussion without losing the focus on harmony and string driven music. I believe it is a must listen for fans of bluegrass and acoustic music... and did I mention the vocals... Oh BTW, I think this version of Edward's ""Sunshine"" is the definitive ""Sunshine."
0,THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU GET,"The picture that they show you is NOT the bead set that you get. It is half the size, not even the same color beads or anything!!!! Shady dealings, I tell you! The only thing that is the same is the name, the set I got IS called the sweet hearts bead set, it is just 100% not the same set that is pictured BEWARE!!!!"
1,Hilarious book but there is some things to look out for...,"Bought this book for a friend's daughter who turned 10 this July. I thought this book would be a perfect gag gift that's actually somewhat useful. I was torn between buying this or ""Everybody Poops"" but thought this was more appropriate.The book is hilarious and definitely something a preschooler or kindergartner could read with their parents. There is some innocent drawn nudity (boy bathing with his dad) so if you're wary about that, I'd suggest buying something else. But honestly, it's like a kid's drawing and you could tell it's not intended to offend. Just a forewarning for those worried about things like that."
1,Very comprehensive but technical,"The book is very comprehensive going into a lot of detail and at times is very technical. There are lots of tables and statistics. However, it does a great job of explaining how the various aspects of the game impact the outcome of each shot. Things like cue ball and object ball movement, best cue stick positions for type of shot, how english and top and bottom spin impact cue ball placement, and much more. If you focus on the less technical aspects taught in this book you will come out with a much better understanding of how to shoot better pool. I'm still reading it but have learned alot and I consider myself a better than average pool player already. It is at times tough reading but you can get into it as deeply as you desire and several readings over time will glean more information."
0,Don't buy it,"This Sudoku YD-638 puzzle is very hard to use. And I think of my self as a computer geek.To make matters worse the instructions are very poor. They may make sense to someone who has used this for years, but not to a new user.Save you money to buy a different game."
0,Steady Decline,"Over the years DJ Irene has been known as one of the largest DJ's in the world. I guess with increasing popularity only comes the inevitable decline that is mainstream. With a title like ""Rock Star"" it's no wonder why Irene seems to have an ascent into the bad DJ hall of fame. I have seen Irene live several times and it shows in her performances as well. With each new release I see this once acclaimed producer falling into a deeper and deeper hole. You want good Irene CD's refer back to the Club series mixes and the Hard House Diva ones as well. Don't agree with me, spend two months in the scene and you will see why Irene is simply the record labels new project."
0,Unrealistic Revaltion,"When Lori was first developing and going through her eating disorder it seemed extremely true to life. I myself have an eating disorder and I could relate to her denial and the control that EDs can have on your mind. However, although it happened to her, the way that she understands and changes her eating disorder is COMPLETELY out of the ordinary. I don't think I would recommend this book to an ED victim because I think that they would be waiting to see their ""skinny self"" in the mirror. For most ED patients, this never happens. Even after they get the ED under control they will never see themselves as this. Through treatment you learn to accept yourself regardless of how you look, but that never changes how it looks in the mirror. Lori was very lucky to be able to see the destruction she was doing to herself, but for most people, they will never see that image in the mirror. God Bless."
0,One of the WORST Pittsburgh bands around.,"These guys just simply suck! They aren't that popular and they think that they are rock stars. Reviews of their albums in the local papers are at best average, and they are nothing new or exciting. I hope they stop giving Pittsburgh bands a bad name."
1,Great speakers,"I bought these speakers to pair with a home theater in a box system for our master bedroom. I didn't want to have to run speaker wires clear around the room for the rear speakers. These speakers worked great right out of the box and I am pleased with them. They were the perfect solution to my challenge. I especially like the ability to increase or decrease the volume right on the speaker - in my application - right on the bedside stands. The only reason I didn't rate this product 5 stars was the fact that I have to turn them off when not in use, or I get a little hum and an occasionl crackle from them. That is not what your need in the middle of the night at the bedside. I assume it is from some electrical interference, but I prefer not to have to turn them on everytime I use them. Other than that, they worked great for me."
0,I DON'T like this game,"This game is NOT worth it!!!!!!!! It is pointless. I tryed it and it makes NO sense!!!!!!! I'm a kid, I would know. It is not fun for any kids. DON'T get this game!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Soft, Cute, and Easy to Clean",This product is really cute for any newborn (boy or girl). It is soft but firm enough for them to sit up in. The slip cover is easy to take off and clean when needed. The size is great. I purchased this for my newphew who is currently 3 months and 13 lbs and there is still plenty of room for him to grow and use it into the future.
0,"Win some, lose some.","This CD is quite a disappointment. It is a very poor recording and in my mind should not be for sale. I am a die hard Marley fan and as I have all of his albums, I risked fate and purchased a few of these Japanese label live recordings. I hope this is the worst of the bunch or I will be back writing another review.Consider yourself warned. I can't recommend this CD to any class of reggae or more specifically Marley fan."

1,No more Bats,"I have bats in my balcony. I have been putting it on late at night and switching it off in the morning. So far so good.I have only seen one bat, but I will update this once I have it a bit longer."
0,Terrible I would not buy another,This item stoped working after 7 days of light use.This item was treated well and with care.What a waste of money.
0,Do you care about truth?,"This book was on the New York Times non-fiction bestseller list for 17 weeks before that newspaper (April 1992) felt compelled to run a FRONT PAGE story explaining that ""Chief Seattle"" never spoke the words attributed to him in this book. Only one kind of reader will care, those who love the truth. Others (read Liberals and God-haters) will have no problem with this book, which is why it still sells well. Read all about this subterfuge in Reader's Digest July 1993, volume 143, issue 855 pages 100 to 104."
1,This really is the book,"This is one of the best programming books I have ever worked with/used. I had a program which I had written in Perl to parse and search unformatted log files. It worked, but very slowly. I picked up this book and thought I would try and rewrite it in C during the holidays. Four days latter it was done. I felt like I had really accomplished something, rewritten my program (which is now over a 100 times faster), and learned some C.The best thing was that I never ran into an example that didn't work and the examples were so straight forward I didn't have to write and try every one. ( I'm of the ilk that usually writes and tries all the examples). I wish they could all be this good."
0,Where do I begin?,"Hoo boy. In gaming, there are a few different ratings. There's good. There's really good. And then there's, let's-throw-this-game-out-the-window-into-the-compost-heap-and-then-set-it-on-fire-and-stomp-on-it-and-bury-it-so-that-no-one-will-ever-find-it. This is the latter. This game is so, so, so, SO bad that it's disgusting. I would give it 0 stars if I could. I mean, come on, is there a game worse than this??? Well, maybe, if you've ever played Cho Aniki on SNES. But don't get me started on that. In any case, don't plan on buying this game, unless you want to go insane."
1,The Works of the Flesh,"An intriguing tale of a man's journey of learning who he really is and what happens along the way. The author does an excellent job of grabbing you from the beginning and never lets go. I couldn't put it down and wanted more when I finally did. Mr. Krause gives a realistic view of the inner workings of the mob and what can happen when someone becomes involved with them. I recommend this book to those who like fast paced, exciting stories with a romantic edge. Mr. Krause has certainly learned the art of combining both."
0,Dvd,This was a not so good story and it could have done without the f word so many times and the end of story was terrible.
1,decent replacement,"I bought this battery to replace a dead one for my Next Generation Remote Control Extender, and it works fine and I saved some money. There are some issues with it though.1. The plus(+) side of the battery doesn't stick out very far, but I was still able to charge it.2. I had to strip off the green plastic around the battery for it to fit in the little RF transmitter.3. It is just a bit longer then the original batteries that come with the Next Generation Remote Control Extender, a tighter fit in my remote but it still fit.If you are a cheapskate like me and want to save some money it will work."
1,"female Garp, only less so","It is only because Irving is so good that his readers can be so critical of him. He is simply a magician at his best, and a con artist at his worst. Undoubtedly, Widow displays his wonderous magic, but as an avid reader, I anticipated all of the tricks and even knew when and where to expect them. But, that doesn't make them any the less wonderous..."

1,The future of fantasy...,"This book was, and still is, the most ground-breaking fantasy novel I have ever read. The characters have incredible character depth and the story line is compelling. R.A. Salvatore shows all the writing skills which will go on to spawn the most compelling fantasy trilogy of all time. I truly loved this book and can only hope that Salvatore goes on to write loads more"
1,Thank you Mark Steven Johnson,"Daredevil is a good comic book movie. Mark Steven Johnson is still finding his way as a film maker, but his dedication to Daredevil can be seen in every frame of the movie and that's very appealing to me. I'm sure there are a lot of things he wishes he could have done better, but there's still a lot to like about this movie. I wont fill up to much space trying to explain it to those who don't get the appeal. Frank Zappa once said ""It's simply this. Either you get it or you don't."" Roger Ebert saw Daredevil and he gets it too."
1,A good amusement,"It took me 2 months to read it and it took my attention in the very beginning. I can see many historical mismatches and the story is too overcrowded with experiences of the main character, obviously it couldn't be like this in 11st century.Anyway, if you want to dream a little and escape from daily rutine, take this book and place it in your night table."
0,A terrible product,"After the first few weeks, the novelty wears off and what you are left with is a toaster that doesn't work very well. It is a very SLOW toaster that does not accomodate large pieces of bread.While the basic idea of making egg and muffin sandwiches is cool, the implementation is poor. What you need to know is that the egg is cooked by boiling a measured amount of water. The steam cooks the egg, but it also condenses all over the egg - leaving you with a soggy sandwich."
1,Big Red Book is Big Help,"I love this book, over 500 verbs fully conjugated. The help in my learning Spanish has been invaluable."
0,OPRAH WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?,This is a self absorbed and selfish woman who came up with a cleaver title and is laughing all the way to the bank.
1,"A great time, but the DVD...","This is a great DVD, a wierd look at how different television was 35 years ago. You'd never see people smoking and drinking, with the guests half soused! In all, this is lots of laffs, most of which are still great today. All in all, the material is quite fun to watch.The producer of the disc has a clear-cut case of ""Because I can,"" that is, ""I can edit the program and add stuff to make it mine, so I did."" The opening was cut and clips of Carson entering the stage from different time periods were used. Ok. The most jarring thing is the psuedo-60s overlays with the guest's names after Carson announces them. What's the matter, can't we hear?Oh well. The material is as good as it can be for a video to film to DVD transfer. Get the disc for the laughs, not becuase there was good editing judgement used in putting it together. Maybe one day we'll get a bigger release of Carson's shows, with no stupid editors attached."
1,wii play,"pretty good game with variety, but the best part about it is getting the remote and a game for such a cheap price compared to a remote and a game seperately"
1,Buy it!!!,"If you love the Yardbirds or Led Zepplin, then you have to have this! Many of the riffs that Paige used in Zep. have their beginnings here. The only downside to this album is one dud of a song (of course that's my taste), and it's too short. Otherwise, it's a fabulous investment!"
1,Once Again!!,"The Queen of The Darkness has done it again! And with a new/old world.Drawing on the ancient legends of Fae and mortal interaction, she has created a simple tale of loss and gain. Throw in a healthy helping of greed, brutality, lust, intolerance and fear, and season with courage, fidelity and true love and you have a delectable dish to satisfy the most discriminating.The characters are well developed. (Some ""minor"" beings, eg. Ahern, the horses, and the pups, are capable of starring in their own tales.)This story, like all of Anne Bishop's works, can be read and re-read, and enjoyed on several levels; whether you see it as fantasy, philosophy, history or, God protect! prophecy. It is well worth the time.Now Miss Bishop, when may we have your next story?"
1,Greed in a Banker's Clothing,"James Stewart's Den of Thieves is an absolute for students and Old Hands in the chameleon like world of proprietary trading. It's a mirror image of the fictionalized tale ""The Bombadiers"", which came out a few years ago. It also reminds me of a joke that used to go around the circuit - it went something like, Whats the difference between Tasmania and Goldman, Sachs? The answer, One is a country that earns $2.0 billion a year and shares it with 25 million people. Goldman, Sachs is a New York investment bank that earns $2.5 billion a year and shares it with 200 people. A must read for students of ""the game""."

0,Don't waste your time,"I recaulked a walk-in shower, allowed the stuff to cure for 48 hours (instead of the 24 in the instructions) and the first time someone took a shower the caulk simply melted away. It had the consistency of marshmallow creme, got gaping holes in it, and I am sure has resulted in damage to the subfloor under the shower."
1,"Great little, inexpensive holster.","This is a pretty decent, inside the pant, leather holster for twenty bucks (or less).There are better IWB holsters that have better draw, comfort, and concealment, but they cost about three times as much.If you need something to quickly slip on for a quick trip, this is perfect. I modified mine to remove the thumb break since this will only be worn for a few minutes at best.It will go on easy and the clip will do ok with the draw, but it is nowhere near as solid as a good IWB pancake style (I like CompTac Minotaur's)If you need an all day concealed carry you should probably look elsewhere."
0,This Sickens Me,"Alright, honestly. Something has to be pointed out here. Trick Daddy and Lil Jons cover of Crazy Train IS NOT in the least bit creative. Crazy Train was a classic song, and all they did was take the beginning riff, make it electronic, put it over a sample, loop is for 4 minutes and throw some mindless ""Yeah, What, Okays"" into the mix. ANYBODY could do that. Is it really excruciatingly painful to write your own song, instead of ripping off everybody elses music and sticking your own crap on top? Or how about forming a coherent sentence? The yeahs, whats and okays get old very fast. And yes...I do realize he had to get permission to do this song, and I cant believe that the record label let him do it. This ridiculous song, along with Battle For Ozzfest and The Osbournes really makes me fear Ozzy is becoming nothing more than another MTV icon."
1,A nice compilation of female vocalists,"This is a nice CD to play if you need to get your female vocalist fix. The tracks are varied, gentle, and melodic. The artists are all talented and great signers. If you enjoy talented female vocalists, this is a great record to pick up."
0,Get this ... mag off the shelves please!,"Maxim started out as a great British mix of babes and guy reading style mag, with nice covers, interesting women featured, with nice photography and humorous articles. Since it split into two versions (US & UK), the US one went completely downhill. Less of a mag (but bigger than the UK because of so many ads) the photography of this magazine has to be just about the worst of any of the men's magazines on the shelf. Just look closely at any cover on the shelf. The women do not look human, they look like animation. WAY TOO MUCH AIRBRUSHING IN PHOTOSHOP guys. I love looking at women, but real photos please, not digital nightmares. An awful looking mag."

1,Great Resource!,This book is fabulous! I used this book with first graders and second graders. It is easy to use and can be put on bulletin boards for quick displays!
1,"holy moly, talk about being creeped out!!!!!!","Well, I thought that this was the most frightening book I have ever read, and that covers a lot of ground. I can identify with Lawrence's fear of under the bed, and also with Dale's of the basement. I think what got me the most is when Mike felt the coldness of the spirit through the floorboards, I mean talk about chills while reading. I'm 25 and i had to sleep with the light on for a couple of nights, that's how well Dan Simmons captures the fear in all of us. Thank you Mr. simmons for the best and scariest book I have ever read and probably ever will."
0,Only good in the beginning,I was fun at first then it became stupid hard and time consuming at the middle/end.
1,Fantastic Experience!!,I would highly rate the seller!! I had a wonderful experience and recieved my book promptly. Thanks for your help and good experience. This is a great Nursing study book.
1,Great travel guide to Europe!,"This book is realy great for everybody who likes to travel Europe. The combination of good pictures, illustration and texts is perfect. You get a good overall view for the most important sights, places, cities and countries in Europe and also a bit of historical information. As a European who already traveled a bit I still could find a lot of inspiration to more interesting places to go. Thank a lot to Eyewitness Travel for there great books!"
0,My First Try as Reviewer,"Didn't care for the title of the book...eye catching, but denagrading to both Jews and African-Americans.Found the book too much of a review of the author's life versus an overview of the Jewish assimilation experience in America."
0,Won't Be Buying,"I have been looking for the original score on CD for several years, particularly for the GC Scott speeches. I thought I had finally found it, but was disappointed to read the reviews which said that they had been excised. I thank the reviewers that mentioned this omission. I will not be buying this album. However, from the number of disappointed purchasers, I suspect the original soundtrack would have a modest following. Not unlike a rerelease of Evergreen by the Stone Ponys and Linda Ronstadt."
0,JUNK! - LOOK ELSEWHERE,"What a piece of crap. Just about a year and it is DEAD - as a doornail!!Won't start, or do anything. I have had other calcs that are FAR SUPERIOR to this PIECE OF CRAP!!Look at Texas Instruments, anywhere but Canon!"
1,Good,"I'm not so crazy for every cartoon movies, but when children's in the house, you are having any choice. Great movie, really enjoyed with the whole family."
1,I loved it.,Wonderfully written with style! Not only gives you what to pack in a survival kit but why you should have it and how to effectively use it. Must read for anyone going into the wilds even for a short day hike. I would recommend it to anyone. Information is centered on how to stay safe and alive for short periods of time. (The time it would take for a search and rescue operation to find you) Included are very valuable ideas to help rescuers find you faster. It does not go into long term primitive living skills such as food collection or how to build log cabins. It does give you all you need to know before going anywhere that has potential for getting lost or stranded and be able to get back out alive.
1,Plant Stand Review,Nice decorative plant stand. It went together easily and looks fine. I had to handle it carefully when putting it together as it appeared the wood posts could split - this is based on noticing a single crack in one post.

1,Rookie says Grizzly made it easy,I am renovating my apartment and I decided to build my own walnut platform bed. I bought some 5/4 walnut stock to make sure I had to buy the planer. Looked here and found the Grizzly and trusted the reviews. Having never used a planer before this was a no brainer planer out of the box. Just plugged it in and it worked perfectly taking 3/16 of an inch off in about 8 passes. I experienced snipe only on my first board... adjusted my feed technique and it was perfect on the next. Some tear out when i tried to take too much material off but adjusted and it was fine. Can't say how long the blades will last but they were as good on the 50th foot as on the first. I intended on selling this after a few projects but i just might be come addicted to wood working after how easy this was to use.

1,Insanely Addictive!,"What do you get when you combine flawless real-time strategy, gorgeous graphics, a wonderfully intuitive interface, perfect balances, and insanely addictive gameplay? Well, my friends- The answer is simple- Homeworld: Cataclysm. The strategical depth of this game is so intense, that the experience is far more than the sum of it's parts. 17 Single Player missions force you to use different tactics in every mission. You can't just waltz in and blow everything up. You MUST use the proper mix of ships to ensure victory. The Multiplayer is practically a game on it's own. I've spent many hours playing online day and night. I've even joined a clan to maximize my playing pleasure. :-)Please, buy this game if your between the ages of -infinty to infinity. Trust me. You won't regret it."
0,How do you snap the legs on and off without injuring yourself??,"I cannot even review this product because I haven't even gotten to the actual installation part yet. I am stuck trying to adjust the legs into the correct hole. They do not just snap on and off. Not unless you've got the strength of a Titan. My fingers are literally bleeding from trying to pry the legs off after I put them in the incorrect holes. If anyone can tell me of an easy way to do this, I'd much appreciate it. So you'll find the claim that this is easy to install to be incorrect as soon as you attempt step one which is to snap the legs on."
1,Unsettling but an intriguing book,I try to read as much about history as possible. People who are fighting or have fought in wars are our loved ones and ancestors. This book is not pretty - but it is not meant to be. It is a book based on one man's journey in life and Auschwitz. I would recommend it to anyone. We need to know the history of our land and people.
1,Appalachian Hymns,"The CDs arrived in a timely manner and the packaging protected them from any damage during shipment. I was pleased with this aspect of my purchase. I ordered these CDs to replace cassettes that have gotten old. The songs are of excellent quality and easy to listen to and therefore, enjoy."

0,Not worth it,"When I put these covers on my stove, the kids immediately thought the stove was even more fun to play with! And they're not very secure. My son pulled them open with almost no effort at all. Now I'll just be keeping the knobs off of the stove and putting them on only when I need them."
1,Buy Pleasure Thieves IMMEDIATELY,"This album is perfect. It's a must own in anyone's collection. Combine wonderful melodic guitars with a mix of synth, strings, and horns with a wonderful voice and you have Pleasure Thieves. It's a perfect mix of all the ingredients. This album does not sound like a debut album it is very well produced.The album keeps coming at you with beautiful song after beautiful song. This band should be huge but they disapeared much to my chagrin. Take a chance on the low price and I promise you will put it on the top of your favorites list."
0,Clicking/Hissing Noise,"I just purchased this unit from a local retailer and was extremely disappointed with the CD playback. Immediately out of the box it was hissing and clicking when I put a CD in. I tried multiple CD's (both RW's and standard) and found no change in the clicking noise. This unit was purchased to play quiet music in an work office and the clicking certainly overwhelms the music at lower volumes. After reading the reviews here, I discovered that I am not the only one with this problem. Given the number of people that have mentioned this problem I would reccomend against purchasing this product."
1,Park Smart Parking Mat is Greatest Invention Made,"This mat is made of heavy duty rubber so you can roll over it again and again with your car. Once set in the right place, it works much better than hanging the old tennis ball. When the car hits the flat part right before the bump, the mat holds still. You roll over the bump with one tire and you are parked just in the right place. I love it."
1,Good Quality Cover,"This cover is sturdy quality, easy to put on and take off my Weber Silver C, the only thing I wish was different is that it gets dirty kind of easy. I really like the color, but I see why most grill covers are black now."
1,The Best Ever Seafood Gourmet Cookbook,I love this cookbook!!! Most of the recipes are one-page in length and are gourmet quality. It's restaurant quality recipes done at home - for those very special dinners. I tested over twenty of the dishes and all are award winning in taste and in presentation. I would recommend this book for the advanced cook who knows the basics and likes to experiment with seafood and sauces.
1,Intriguing insights into Mathematics,"The author is a lover of Mathematics, and delves into the subject from a much deeper perspective than the conventional dry texts - he sees mathematics as a delight, and approaches stardard features ( e.g. Pythagoras' theorem ) from a variety of of standpoints, rather as one might view a painting in an art gallery - each standpoint deepening one's sense of wonder at the subject.The book contains 10% maths formula, and 90% discussion. A great shame it's out of print. I was lucky enough to find a used copy through Amazon's excellent used book system."

0,Not an Aleratec product!,"I just received my buffer kit today. I was surprised that it WAS NOT an Aleratec product as was represented. It was actually a product with the name ""Hip Gear"", a ""polishing kit"" and it does not seem to be as good a quality as the buffing wheels that came with the Aleratec Disk Repair Plus kit. In fact, it gives the name and models of the products it is made for, but it DOES NOT list the Aleratec model. The pads on the kit are very thin and look as if they have already lived their serviceable life. It also has a piece with a clear, square base, that does not come with the disk repair kit, and NO explanation or instructions on what it is or how it is used. Cheap price, CHEAP kit! Definitely NOT as represented!"

0,Our ferret died with this cage,"After looking around for a cage we chose this one based on the height to provide more space for our ferret. It is a bit cumbersome to get the shelves to into the cage and to stay latched to the cage. The sides of the cage hook together but are not very secure. Our ferret pushed through the sides of the cage where the sides did not stay hooked together. We were not home and so she was squeezed by the metal as she got only 1/2 way through. Therefore, she died. I would not recommend this cage due to the poor construction and safety implications."
0,Disappointing!,"I'm a Jamie Lee Curtis fan and I liked her horror movie Halloween and I liked Stacy Keach in his Mike Hammer TV show, I did not like Road Games, it was not very good and the plot was basically nonexistent and it wasted the talents of both Jamie and Stacy, I definitely would not add this to my collection."
0,3 pages stretched to 200,"The naysayers are correct. This book has a great message, in fact 200 pages of great message, all of which could have been explained in adequate detail in 3 pages or a single blog post. Don't waste your money, skim it at the book store and go home and live it."
1,"A dry cast, day after day from showering","Don't mess with the Curad brand cast protectors on Amazon....The Seal Tight from Brown Medical is the real deal! My son used this for 4 weeks with a hand cast, and it worked perfectly every day! The seal on your forearm is water-tight around your arm with a flexible rubber seal. A+ from Amazon, and cheaper than your local medical supply store!"

1,Best Tea Ever,"I drink tea daily and have for over fifty years. When I first tried Barry's Tea, I knew I had found my favorite brand. It's flavor is bold, but very yummy at the same time. I will not be without it again! I have even given it and the decaf as Christmas gifts with a tea pot to a few friends. They also thought it was outstanding tea."
0,YUK-Don't waste your time or money,"This book is AWFUL. Full on lots of blank space and simple minded lists. If this stuff is news to you, you're already in trouble. If you want REAL ADVICE read ANY of Alan Weiss's books on the subject."
0,tahiti fete of hilo,Picture and sound un-professional. It is more like a camcorder rendition. Have been to Tahiti 6 times and love Tahtian dancing and music. Have seen great vidoes of such and hoped this was one of them. I am sorely disapointed. The 5 star review was misleading
1,Cruising the ICW,"I was helping a friend bring his boat from South Carolina to Southwest Florida. In conjuction with the other books we had with us, we were well informed of the services that were available to us during the cruise. I would not take the trip again without this book."
1,The scariest movie ever produced in Denmark!,"Ole Bornedals breakthrough movie as a director. He later did a Hollywood version of this film. It was a good version, but nothing compared to this - the original. It's a creepy, almost claustrophobic (sp?) film.I will not tell you to skip the Hollywood version, but I strongly recommend you to watch this film."
0,Not for extreme chewers,"Was given to my 40 pound staffy for Xmas. The petstore owner assured the giver it was indestructible. In under 5 minutes he had the corner off, in under 10 the nylon started to shred and some stuffing out. Was in the trash by Xmas dinner. Seemed well put together and probably fine for moderate chewers."

0,Not for night time. They Leak.,The goodnites leak. The first night when my three year old child used the goodnites he woke up in the morning with sheets and pajamas soaked. I would not buy them again and I would not recommend them. It might depend on the age of the child. It would have been helpful if the description would have mentioned for ages 4 to 8.
1,Best travel accessory every!,Such a great invention! We traveled out of the country with this with our son and i don't know how we would have made it and had to carry the huge car seat around! We bought a seat for my son and needed a way to help carry him and some of our stuff through the airport. I tried it at home so we knew what we were doing once we were at the airport. Those cart things you put the car seat on are $80-$100 sorry i wont use it enough to pay for that. I couldn't recommend this product enough!

1,They worked well for a replacement for my original OEM wires...,"for my Ford Bronco ii. Ford has always been known to make good spark plug wires and these are no exception. What made it a bonus for me in buying these is that these wires had been made so long ago that there was no world wide web address on the box, thus I knew these are better wires than what is out in the replacement wire market today."

0,Very little truth,"The second book I have found by this author, who gives little truth and much fluff. Sad she is an attorney, let alone an author, this woman is clearly a trust mill selling trusts. I should have known by the ""author's"" other book that this would be a terrible waste of time. Save your money; get your information for the state bar or a practicing attorney; not a trust mill selling seniors a bad bill of goods. Her readers and clients are ill served by her work. She is not even certified by the State Bar as a specialist!"
1,Mariza carries the freight,"Like Andrea Bocelli, when in need of soulful transport through solitude, I turn to Mariza's fado concert in Lisbon for surcease. She always delivers.Their capacity to contain, form and express intense emotion is an extraordinary gift from the Gods to all who can receive.Viewing the concert's DVD is an additional treat, but of a different order.I recommend both -- for different moods --in your home discography."
1,Be sure to do your homework when reading reviews,"This is a fine Latin text for the mature or adult student who is able and willing to learn and to study Latin as more than a hobby. I must add for the consumer's sake that a previous review is very misleading. ""Bennett's New Latin Grammar,"" suggested as an alternative, is not a textbook, but a reference grammar best suited for beginning to intermediate Latin students (more advanced grammars being ""Allen & Greenough"" and ""Hale & Buck""). Wheelock is a fine alternative to ""Latin: An Intensive Course,"" and is somewhat easier to follow, but either book will suit a mature individual. I highly recommend using in addition a good mid-level dictionary (Chambers-Murray being the best for size, scope, and price) as well as a good beginning reference grammar (Bennett being the most readily available, and probably the easiest to use--but you'll want to upgrade later)."
0,Freekin Boring,"I fast forwarded the first three minutes because there was absolutely nothing going on. Just a black screen. I know why. But it was boring. It never recovered. The dude wakes up in the pine box, gets all panicky. I gave it ten minutes. Lame. Never showed any promise so I just turned it off."
0,Not a classic,"I purchased this book thinking it would be along the lines of the Aesop fable. It is not. The story reads like The Little Red Hen with the lion asking who will help him remove the thorn from his paw and all the other animals replying they are too busy. The mouse does remove it in the end but that's it, No moral no comment. Not much for your child to take from this book."
1,Handbag Hook,"Everytime I use it, people ask where I got it. I love keeping my handbag off the floor and in full view as opposed to under the table or the back of my chair. The only thing I would suggest is to make it a little longer as some wood bars & counters are a little too deep to accomodate the hook."
0,Music is Dead,"I'm not a kid I'm 17 and hear my sister listen to this crap all the time. Don't waste your time with this crap, you kids wanna listen to punk then buy the misfits box set not the hilary duff album, music is dead, hilary duff is wasting away physically and isnt even attractive anymore... so as a summary she's ugly, she makes terrible music, she's stupid and has an annoying face sounds lika a good record to me. Go get a real kick ass album like Shout At The Devil, or Appetite for Destruction... but in the name of all that is evil please Hilary Duff and hilaryduff fans stop using the devil horns or i'll eat your families."

1,Gordon shows this bands diverse style,"As a fan of all types of music I found Gordon to be one of my most listened to cds. From Hello City's cool harmonies to Grade 9's ska sound and the semi-country style of If I Had A $1,000,000 and Crazy to the blues of I Love You, This band has a style all their on. whatever my mood I can always listen to Gordon."

1,Well done Celine - but Cyndi's is better.,"When I first heard Celine singing this on her Chrysler commercial campaign, I could hardly believe my ears. Celine had covered a Cyndi Lauper classic? Celine does a great job with her version which is aimed at the dance floors. Her voice sounds great and the song rocks.But once again, this proves in the inferiority of remakes. Beat for beat, vocal for vocal, Cyndi Lauper's version blows Celine's out of the atmosphere. Whereas Celine's is guided toward the club, Cyndi's version is haunting. Cyndi sings this song from the heart and captures the longing and desperation in her vocals. Buy both if you can (they're both good) but if you had to choose one or the other, buy Cyndi's."

0,Erratic performance after a month,"I have a total of four UPSes at home including the BX1000, which I purchased from CompUSA with a hope for high performance. The symptom of frequent switching beween ""on-line"" and ""on battery started"" after a month or so, when the replacement peirod at CompUSA had just expired. It beeps every few minutes while it is on. Sometimes, the power dies and my screen becomes blank. I have had good faith in APC's product, thus it is a disappointment."
1,Original Forsytes,Loved this series when originally shown on PBS and love it today. Like visiting old friends you haven't seen in years but still feel connected to.
0,Not worth it even if cheap,"I got these headphones for 30 bucks thinking YES!!! They were horrible in the gym. The volume control instantly failed and then the track selector. But, wait, that isn't the worst part. For folks that lay on their back for any exercise in the gym, don't get these. They really aren't that loud to begin with, but when you lay down say for bench, the back part pushes against your neck, and then the ear buds pop out. Now you don't hear any music.If you are just going on a road trip and can get these for cheap,...maybe then, but not for the gym."
1,Error found on math question!,"The book is overall very good. It's clear, and is in a language that students can understand. Explanations are easily read, without 'overdumbing'. I love the detailed review of grammar, and vocabulary. The only problem that I found was in a math question in the diagnostic test in the beginning of the book. On #21 of section 4, the answer given on page 65 is 1/16. When explained, the answer given is 1/16-1/32=1/16 This is the the same as saying 2-1=1. Well, I just wanted to point that out. Otherwise, the book is very helpful, and it's something that I recommend every student buy,"
0,"Poor use of English language ruins ""goode"" intentions","We received our copy as a gift.

0,Do not purchase,"I have tried to cook two meals in this crockpot and both times, it burned my food. It cooks very hot even on the low setting. Do not purchase this item."
1,I loved this!,This book was the best of the series in my view. It starts out normal then reels you into a world of outstandingly advanced technology. The charecters are described in vivid detail and the epic ship battles were out of this world. I think Weber has a very bright future ahead of him and if he keeps doing this kind of work he will be racked umong the greats.
0,They changed my favorite wand,"I have been using this product for 2 years and have loved it. I just bought myself a new one for Christmas. And it's awful. The pencil is hard and no tint seems to come off it. It's like pulling a plastic tip across my skin. Whatever Mally did , please go back to your old creamy formula. In the meantime I will be returning this."
0,Product not worth buying,Purchased this product and thought it would work perfectly in keeping my dogs from the garden. After hooking it up if worked for a month or so and then stopped working (go figure) just after the return date had expired at Amazon. Stay away from this product. The shock is good but the product stops working in a short period.
1,The best OZ movie to date!!!!,"I love this movie. It is more in the spirit of L.Frank Baums books and sticks to the book so closley. The characters such as the Scarecrow, Tin Man, the Lion, Tik Tok, Jack, and Gump look more like they should from the covers of the original books(not people in make-up and colorful clothes). If you are thinking of getting this and have silly ideas of it being like the classic musical DON'T! It's much different, but in my mind better. Tik Tok is my favorite character and he looks and sounds so cool. Hope this helps anyone interested in this movie. Being from Kansas i should know right? -LOL"
0,Not Leather,"I expected a leather bound pocket New Testament and found it was, according to its own stamped discription, ""Leather-Look."" I also wish that the description had indicated that the ""words of Jesus"" would be in red."
1,Great toy,"We got this for our 15 month old daughter and she loves to play with it and ""feed"" everyone in the family. Her older brothers get a kick out of putting everything back together just to watch her cut or tear them apart again. Thanks Melissa and Doug for a food toy that will really last!"
0,Action pornography,"I waited years before finally renting this video because I knew that it was going to be bad. In fact, I got it for free because I rented a new release at the same time. I was fully prepared for the badness of the movie, friends had told me, ""It's bad, but Jet Li is really cool.""Strangely enough, I was still surprised at how awful the movie was. The reason that I call this movie action pornography is because every scene is contrived to show action. There's almost no pretence at a real plot, it's just action scene after action scene with some veneer of story written in as an aside. That sounds like pornography to me with action subsctituted for sex.All of the jokes have been done before, even in the last few Lethal Weapons movies. They're funny but I heard that in the last movie.If you liked this movie, you might want to take a look at Armageddon, it's about in the same quality category."
1,Top 3 For Sure!,"... Some of the best and most quotable lines of all time. ""I stick my neck out for no one"" ""...hill of beans"" etc. And the singing of the French anthem over the nazis singing theirs never fails to put a lump in my throat. Keep in mind folks, the outcome of WW2 was still very much in doubt. Propaganda?...absolutely. But still one of the best ways to spend a couple of hours."
0,Diaries a scam?,"Those diaries of Jim Morrison are probably a forgery. It reminds me of the fake Hitler's diaries a few years back. Furthermore, according to a friend who visited the website for the book, he left a message in the guestbook expressing his doubts about the diaries, and it got changed by the webmaster into a positive review! Many witnesses were present with my friend when it happened. This, already, is a bad sign.I visited the website myself to read some excerpts of the book. The writing doesn't feel like Morrison. It doesn't have this sparkle you see in his poems, and believe me, I have ALL of Morrison's writings. It doesn't feel right.I think that poets in general, and Morrison in particular, deserve better than this. If you love the Lizard King, buy his books, they are all available at Amazon, and pass these ""lost diaries"". Go for the real thing."

0,The Worst Piece of Junk Ever,"This is offically ""The Worst Piece of Junk (or #$#%$) Ever"" and a rip-off.DO NOT BUY IT IF YOU INTEND ON PUTTING IT IN A ACTUAL, REAL FIRE.I heat the house by woodburning stove and as soon as I heated it up a little, AND I MEAN A LITTLE, it bent horribly and is rendered useless.Made in China- I should have known better, but was being cheap.I'd send it back to the people I bought it from, but it's not worth the postage or aggrivation.Please don't make the same mistake I did!"
0,Utterly ridiculous,"This book is so incredibly contrived, I'm not sure where to begin. How about the part about recommending that a consultant learn to type fast, as it allows one to get more work done per minute and gives the impression that you are busy? In the end, it's just another thinly-veiled attempt by some self-appointed ""experts"" to cash in on the R/3 phenomenon. There are better books out there that provide a lot more knowledgeable insight on being an independent consultant; they might not be SAP-specific, but neither is a lot of this book's content--in spite of its title."
1,Love all of Leigh Greenwood's books!,All of the books in Leigh Greenwood's Seven Brides Series are just wonderful and this book is no exception. Very enjoyable reading and each book makes you eager to start the next one in the series and sigh in disappointment when the last page of the last one is read.
0,bed design,"We've had this vacuum for 3 months now, so there's been plenty of time to use it. AT first it worked great, but it quickly became clear that the path dirt much travel between the floor and the collection chamber has far too many twists and turns to be effective. It has now become a regular ritual to disassemble the vacuum to clean huge clogs from the various choke points in the hose (at least different ones!)Don't bother with this vacuum, a waste of money."
0,Worst book I ever bought,"This was the absolute worst book I have ever purchased. First of all it is extremely small and poorly written. In order to fill up the small pages, many blank lines were inserted and the author repeats the same information numberous times where there is print. The information echos the rantings of a woman newly released from a bad relationship and discounts the feelings of all others. This is fit only for someone who really is ""the One"". That is, if they were the one and only person on the planet."
1,One of the better stories,"The people who translated this did a very VERY good job on this with few exceptions such as: using the word ""scouts"" and the dub names for the inners (in the ""S"" season manga, the use the original names for the outers) and they did try to americanize the story a tad for example: in the very first book, they said that Ami looks like Demi Moore..I really don't think that is said in the original version :) but with those exceptions, the translated all the manga very well."
1,"Fine Turner performance, mediocre movie.","Melodrama may not be Tracy's cup of tea, but it's definitely Lana's. This film showcases Turner at the peak of her career at MGM. Lingering closeups fill the screen with her luminous beauty. Her character in this film is an outsider who rebels against the strictures of small-town life. Tracy plays her much older husband and the two have a delightful and unexpected screen chemistry. Several scenes demonstrate what made Turner one of MGM's top box office draws--her delight as she models some new clothes in a swank New York shop, a tender scene with Tracy after she is seriously injured in a traffic accident, and her heart-rendering portrayal of grief when she learns that her much-anticipated baby is stillborn. It's a lovely performance from Turner, very fresh and natural and quite different from the cold, reserved characterizations of her later films. An essential purchase for Turner fans."
1,World War I at its finest,A good book that describes the Marine Corps actions in World War I. The book is very interesting as it comes from a marine's point of view. The book does sometimes leave something to be desired with its to the point writing style.
1,What a great teaching tool!,We love this puzzle so much. It has been a wonderful teaching tool and has stood up to the wear and tear of daily use. I love how the states are a fairly close representation of the actual state lines- vs those puzzles who look more like cartoons. It is a good size and easy to read. We love it!
1,Oh yeah...,"This thing is awesome! It is very comfortable in your hands, and altough the buttons may look complicted at first, they are easy to get used to. The controller is incredibly durible. I have owned 2 of these and two Mad Catz controllers, and the microsoft ones have outlived the two Mad Catz controllers by about half a year. The xbox controllers can be droped repeditivly, sat on, stepped on, and bitten by a 4 year old, and I am still using it. It also feels great in your hands and IS NOT TOO BIG! The 4 year old can use it with little difficulty, so u sure can.*****/*****"

0,Same problem here - doesn't hold a charge,"I experienced the same problem as the other reviewer - the unit didn't hold a charge even after 72+ hours of charging. Ordered a replacement unit within a week and couldn't believe it, but also this one had the problem and I needed to return again !"

0,Horrible message,"I bought this book because I was hoping for a sex positive book for females. I was definitely wrong. Tons of the short stories were of women being taken advantage of. For example, take Goldy Locks and the Three Bears. Instead of bears it was three men. When they found Goldy Locks in their house they surrounded her and started taking off her clothes. It sounded more like rape than sexy to me. Every story the female didn't like what was happening, but then suddenly she was fine with it.To me this was not a female positive book at all. It was just suggesting the idea that women like being raped."
0,Disappointed,"I ordered three of the 9100's the first week of June, 2008. I was surprised that one of the units had completely stopped working by the second week of July and then a week later a second unit failed. Replacing the batteries did not help with either of the failed units so I will be returning all three units for a refund. The refund will only be a partial refund since it has been over 30 days since I made the purchase."
0,Convoluted tripe,"The director Nicholas Evans, sought a venue for his latest cyber-nanotechnological theory. Sadly unlike the Coen brothers, it wasn't rooted in solid physical concrete production design nor did it consider the viewers, innocent babes, seeing it for the first time. I'm a screenplay writer, with one optioned project, have watched movies non stop since age 9 with family and friends, lived and worked in NYC as a professional writer, but don't know how this got produced, unless Knob Leonardo deCaprio fronted most of the geld. Oh, whoops! Look at those credits! Here, let's throw in some car chase sequences, stern visaged close ups, home theme,,,,awwww.....guns......terse vacuous dialogue.....zippo emotional content because it is, Leonardo....sans the heart of a real lion. Save your money and go to the zoo."
1,Wonderful Product!,"Finally, a cheese slicer that works without wires! While visiting my parents this summer, I asked to use a cheese slicer for a dish I was preparing, and Dad produced a this slicer that blew me away. I had to have one and was thrilled to find one on Amazon.com. This is a fabulous item, simple in design, and will last forever!"
1,Great camera! Loved it,"I've decided to jump from a Compact Digital Camera to SLR,and a thou I've seem quite a few reviews on this camera on the net,but I was quite stounded with with the size of the camera,especially the size the lens.The build-in Anti-Shake sensor is really useful compare to some other SLRs (about the same class). The noise reduction is quite good.But still there's some downsides as well, as said in the review from websites. The live view is useful.(Like when you've to put the camera over your head or very low, etc)But there's a quite long delay when its doing the focusing job.And the people who wears glasses may find it quite hard to see in the viewfinder, may need to buy ME-1.Anyway..since there's a lots of opinions, I won't comment too much.but I would say its a great camera, and I'm loving it! =D(Sorry for the poor English.)"
0,Careful,"If I had time I would send this back. Appears to only work with power connections that are on the same breaker. I have a small house (1600 sq.ft), and are unable to have the Master/Slave see each other unless they are on the same breaker. It is either run a cable or get good wireless, waste of $$ and time at least for me."
0,Another Death in the Industrial Era. R.I.P. S.P.,This was a real shocker when i got the cd about three weeks ago thank to a online buddy. But I really tried to give the album a chance only daddyuwarbash whatever song that was decent but the rest sorry. They had almost 10 years to write stuff and it comes down to this. A Shame. But with this album I say this should be the final straw and hang up the synths and Vocador and call it the final nail in the coffin. The songs were too over here and over there it was not like the dark elements and the dark vocals and harsh lyrics just a sold out industrial band. Thank You SYNTHSPOP for making this all possible. I will stick to my New Wave Bands and CDS. Industrial is dead!
1,Wonderful CD,I love this CD. Carolyn Arends has a great voice and is easy to sing with. This is a Christian CD with some excellent music to make you feel good anytime you hear it. I recommend this CD.
1,Kind of Fun,"It is what it says it is, a brain game. The ""tests"" have a lot of variety and if you are looking for a game like this I would recommend it. The only thing I dislike about it is you can't by pass all the ""you did great"" messages. Once you finish a set, you have to click through a bunch of screens that you have seen after every other set."
1,Action Replay is Very Cool,My Action Replay arrived very fast.I am Pleased with the Product and Overall Very Happy !Anthony from Dallas
1,Good but not Perfect,"The wireless controllers for the 360 are of course amazingly comfortable. There is one small problem, unlike the PS3 controllers, they do not have a built in Lithium ion rechargeable battery which is a serious problem. I wish Microsoft had been less cheap and made that an included feature on their controllers rather than a separate thing you must buy."
0,Eegad!,"With such a promising beginning and a story that could easily have written itself, one has to ask...How could you blow it in such a big way. I sat in horror indeed, grasping my head firmly in my hands, rocking back and forth violently crying, ""Why did he ever get out of the truck and show himself?"" So many great ideas crashed through my head during the first part of the movie as to what our friendly neighborhood killer could be, and what he was attempting to accomplish. I more than once found myself muttering repeatedly ""What the Hell!"". In short, this movie found new ways to violate me...don't let it happen to you."
1,As Time Goes By series,"The item arrived in a timely fashion and is intact. I was disappointed that half of the CD's will not secure in the holder. They come loose and rattle around, which makes me wonder if they were previously opened. Otherwise very pleased."

1,Perfect for the work shop.,"I have a wood shop outdoors where I build tables, shelves, cheese tables.. etc. as a hobby. I also have to have music too. I had to rig my cable to work with an old portable stereo (since the speakers on it didn't work). Impressive quailty for the price :)"
1,Smashing,"This album is un-mistakenly one of Quincy's best ever, if not thee best, the genuine talents of the artists and musicians embraces your mind and body in some relaxing but high energetic and melodious melodies, definitely a collectible."
1,Pretty Good Pump,"I don't really have anything to go by, but I think this pump is great. Once you get the hang of it, it doesn't hurt, it does a thorough job and it was a decent price. The only problem I have with it is that the arms sometimes move while I am pumping and I lose suction because the cup gets moved. The manufacturer should of had a locking mechanism for them. Otherwise it's a lot faster than doing it by hand!! That's for sure!I would buy this product again if I had to!"
0,Only if your an only child,I bought this game for my niece and nephew who are about seven years of age. I don't know how to put the game on multi player and it says it plays up to four players. it's not so easy to understand. My niece likes it. My nephew believes it's a game and it's great. It's got trivia and all that. Just don't want to play it. I am 28. So...buy if your a gamer.
1,Astonishing,"This book is a gift. Written well, it causes people to think. Very informative, it is similar to the movie but with much more detail."
1,fun,"Maybe not quite as good as Carrie's Story, but still lots of fun (and I think I read all the words in this one too)."
0,Highly overrated.,"I don't understand the hype surrounding this guy, honestly. All my friends rave about how funny he is, yet I find his material boring, unfunny, and full of annoying/stupid sound effects. I also can't take how he carries jokes out WAY too long. My wife finds this crap hilarious yet she can't explain why. Maybe Dane is like that guy in highschool that all the girls thought was so funny and yet all the guys hated his guts?With so many talented, original and funny comedy CD's (mitch hedberg, david cross, mike birbiglia, todd barry, patton oswalt, etc.) I can't imagine why you'd waste your money on this CD."
1,A great read for horse lovers!,"This book is great for everyone who loves horses(especially the Black)! After a fight at Hopeful Farm, the Black and Alec head to a free-range ranch for a few months. On the way, a accident in the wilderness sends Alec across many states running from the police(he has amnesia and thinks he murdered someone) and trying to regain his memory."
1,Good movie,"I love the movie, it should have gotten 5 stars but the case it came in looked like it had been cut by a saw. The DVD was still new, just the case is damaged."
0,This phone is not good for a Motorola,"I really dislike this phone!! We bought it becasue it was a Motorola and figured that would assure us a higher quality - wrong!! It cuts out a lot of the time, the caller ID function has a lot of quirks compared to other phones I have used. The phone also sounds ""tinny"" a lot of the time. Everyone who comes over and uses it, comments on its bad sound quality. I would NOT recomend. WE are currently searching for a new one."
0,Odd history,This is a pretty book and no doubt i contains much of value. However the article on the history of Finland is fundamentally flawed and quite misleading. For example it claims that language conflicts have been a central issue in the history of Finland. That is has little to do with reality. The article is so odd it makes you wonder what sources have been used. It also makes the whole book seem quite unrealiable. It's a shame because the book is nice enough otherwise and could probably fill a gap in many a book shelves.
1,Runaway Smash Hit!,Brilliant work from Julia Roberts and Richard Gear. It's about time you guys got together again to film this movie. The movie flows very well from one scene to the next. The scenes are hilarious. It's not very often you get a movie with good clean fun anymore. I highly recommend you watch this movie to the very end!
1,Don't Miss It,"This show is one of my favs. I like westerns, but I love Hell on Wheels. It has a great story line and cast. This is one show I never miss."
0,AWFUL!,"I recall seeing ""Caligula"" when it first came out. And for all the controversy it caused, it is nothing more than an expensive porn film. But aside from that, it is appallingly bad....boring, tedious, shocking for it's own sake and just plain stupid. The violence is gratutious and the sex is added to try and shock mainstream audiences. An abomination."
1,Contrary to Popular Opinion.....,"The drive is great. Access speed are limited to your ethernet speed so access speed can be an issue for speed demons out there. However, contrary to popular belief, you do not need to install any software. Microsoft's built-in network manager can find the drive easily on the same network. If you want the drive for use outside your private network then you WILL need the software. Otherwise, there are a lot of sour grapes out there that do not know how to find a network drive. Word to the wise, the first time we put the drive on the network we had to turn the power off and turn it back on since it didn't get assigned an IP address on the router. So this method may be the trick you need to SEE it on the network. Enjoy a great home solution to networking."
0,Tacky play on words,"Perhaps a third grader might get a few yucks out of the sexual innuendo, but I find it hard to believe that anyone old enough to drive would find this amusing enough to put on the their car. Two thumbs down on this sticker."
0,Very shallow,"If you are looking for good reference book, this is not it. The book shows the topics but they are treated very superficially, you cannot even find a good complete example. I do not recommend it if you are looking for a serious decision analysis book."
0,Died after 4 months,"It died after four months, used it probably 10 times, such a shame, not worth the price. Get the five bucks thermomether instead."
1,Long Live Inu-Yasha!,"Though Inu-Yasha is not as lovable as Ranma1/2, I would reccamend this book to anyone. It does not contain the vivid artwork of some other creators, but never the less the artwork is fabulous. The only thing that I object to the is the price. Are they ever going to lower the price of this grpahic novels to something that won't leave you flat broke?"
0,Cruiser1,"I have had this griddle for about 1 1/2 yrs. I agree with most others. One side heats better than the other. After first few uses items stopped sticking. I did like it for creating the filling for breakfast burritoes, you know hashbrown potatoes,sausage,bacon,eggs and cheese wrapped in tortillas. But now everything sticks it has heat marks from where the element is and the teflon has worn off. I bought this when it first came out and only paid $20 for it so I guess I got my moneys worth. But when you have 4 children waiting on their pancakes you can't have some cooked others stuck and falling apart. I am currently looking for a new griddle hope I find one worthy enough to stand up to the demands that I put on my cookware."
0,"Warning!!!! Not worth the time, much less money.","This is my second review....first one was taken off mysteriously? I do not recommend this video...unless you really really need a step by step instruction (which apparently is one....rub here). I am not sure where the great reviews came from, or how this video will improve a women's masturbation technique."
1,Great reading,"The third book of Henning Mankell and his inspector Wallander. And again it is a great book to read. This time Wallander is confronted with a women who is shot without any apparent motive. From the beginning the reader knows what is going on: she was at the wrong time at the wrong place. The assassination of Nelson Mandela is prepared in Sweden and the woman has seen things that she was not supposed to see. Only after a long and complicated investigation Wallander and his colleagues can unravel all the ties and go after the villain, the ex-KGB man Konovalenko.From the beginning the reader knows both sides of the story and sees the events through the eyes of all actors, but this book is still very exciting with numerous unexpected turns. There are a few chapers which are a bit boring, that is why I give this book 4 rather than 5 stars."
0,Top heavy item!,I bought this item last year from another retailer for my children. My younger child had knocked it over onto my older one about 30 times in two weeks when i returned it.
0,Extremely disappointing,"This is the first time I've been compelled to write a review. I am not overly-knowledgeable about the ""Concordians,"" but am reasonably literate. I'm much more familiar with the London Bloomsburians, and love literary biography. I am not qualified to speak to the alleged plethora of inaccuracies in the book, but even without that, it's a very disappointing book. Yes, it's readable and somewhat entertaining, but I'm learning very little about the thought and inner lives of the Transcendentalists. The book also moves confusingly between what would charitably be called analysis, and chronology. I suppose this is a fault of editing, but it makes the book less coherent. The only positive to having bought this is that I now plan to read some of the good books recommended by other disappointed reviewers."
1,Up! The Movie,This is an awesome and uplifting movie that can be enjoyed by all ages. We've watched it several times now and loved it each time. We need more movies like this one!
1,"The best game ever!! well, second best","This is the best, well second best, game ever!! The graphics are awesome, but they will take some getting uesd to. the gameplay is supurb, and the musical score is awesome. I would have given this game a better rating, but this is the highest they allow."
0,error filled,"I was one of the people interviewed for this book and am quoted several times throughout. It's a slip shod effort by Shipnuck that is filled with factual errors, misspelled words and names and typos. The author is desparately trying to be funny and along the way he stretches the truth. Beem's win at the 1999 Kemper Open and how he got there is a great story. Unfortunately, Shipnuck shouldn't have been the one to tell it."
1,What do you call 12 great Nick Gilder tunes on one CD?,"A GOOD START!Back when Razor & Tie had just released the first of Donnie Iris' LP's, their web site asked visitors for suggestions on what artists they would like to see released. I immediately emailed them saying they HAD to release albums by Nick Gilder and City Boy (i'm still waiting for City Boy).Well, it took a long time, but this CD is GREATLY appreciated. Nick Gilder was a standout rocker with a unique sound. If Nick is crankin' out of your system, you aren't going to mistake him for anybody else..About the CD...Nice remastering. The songs sound crisp and clear. A decent selection of songs, but as other reviewers have noted, some glaring ommissions. Some of my favorites that are NOT on the CD: Metro Jets (how did this one get away???)We'll Work It Out (Hello??) Time After Time (McFly...Anybody Home?) Hold On Me Tonight. Well, the list could go on."
0,won't play CD's,"This unit plays movies but will not play a music CD. It starts to play, jumps and starts over. I have tried many CDs and it isn't just older ones but it treats new ones the same way. Unfortunately, I didn't test a CD while it was in the first three months warranty. I am now trying to get it fixed but can't get a repair scheduled within two weeks at the earliest. I am very unimpressed."
1,"Dam, its really hard to read.","I dont say it is hard in regards of complexity, or understanding. It is because when you read it you will face reality that has been ignored for so long. I really hurts to step on other people's shoes. nonetheless I feel happy because now i have been informed. It was an overall sad experience, but It is right to know what is going on in the doorstep. I recommend it. true, harsh, real... super super real and well produced."
1,The Perfect Pet,"For someone who wants a perfect pet without all the work, this is the way to go. It's cute and realistic."
1,Reusable filter - works as advertised,"ilter works as advertised. If you have a special coffee grind not available in pre-packaged K-cups, this will get the job done. The filter is built from durable plastic and a wire mesh screen. I've used this product for over a year now a few times per month and it's help up fine. I even wash it in the dishwasher. This would have got 5 stars, but the filter holder is sometimes difficult to pop in and out of the Keurig machine.The reviewer was compensated for posting this review. However, the opinion stated in the review is that of the reviewer and the reviewer alone. Further, the reviewer independently selected this product to review and has no affiliation with the product maker/distributor, Amazon or the review requester"

0,color not what I thought,"The wrap was the perfect weight for spring, but the color was awful! I ordered sandy brown, expecting a light brown. The actual color was a burnt orange. Sent it back."
0,"Not great, not bad","I listened to cd and I dont know how to explain this cd. I cant really explain to well I guess, but i'll try. The problem I had was the swearing. I usually dont have a problem with swearing, but the way this band did it ruined the cd. It seemed like every other word in the songs are F$%*. It sounded like they tried to damn hard to impress the youth by doing this. The cd held nothing speical at all, not what I really wanted to hear in a metal cd. If you want really inspiring music go and listen to a Hatebreed cd. This cd is alright, but the swearing was so stupid and out of place. HA! Thats what I meant to say, the swearing just seemed random and out of place. Thats what the problem with the cd was. Just add it here and there, not every other word. Probably would have been a better cd that way. To fans fo Throwdown, please do complain. Everyone has an opinion and that is mine."
0,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this book. At first I was very excited to order the book due to the reviews on line (which is why I continue to review - to give readers a true outlook on a book)This book is staged in Britain and it is very difficult to ascertain what they are talking about in the book unless you ARE british OR you have lived in Britain; because of this, I believe that you just can't get thru this book - you get held up trying to figure out what they are talking about."
1,All of Andy Gibb's hits in one CD,This really is a great CD. I'd recommend it for all Andy Gibb fans.
0,I feel bad about my neck; and other thought on being a woman.,Did nopt order but did read it a long time ago and really liked it. Do9 you think I ordered it? Am I paying for it? NOOOOOO
1,The Widow of Larkspur Inn,"Loved the story line, the truthfulness in how some women were left without any means of support because of their husbands gambling habits. Loved the way the manners of the era were never let down. A very good read."
1,This is a funny video.,"This IS a funny video, Bob Nelson is funny no matter what audience he is performing for. But I was disappointed because I was looking for the ""older"" Bob Nelson (when he still used profanity). This one is real clean. It does have the ""morning on the farm"" skit, which is ALWAYS good for quite a few laughs. I would give this a 5 if he still did some of his more hard core stuff."
1,New Tricks - Season Two,I really enjoy the series and am happy to have bought this season. Our local PBS station broadcasts the series but I am not able to see all the episodes and have not seen them repeated. This is so much more convenient and I am able to see all the shows.
1,pleasing chants,"I bought this to use during massage sessions. It is definitely chants so is suitable for some times when repetition is not an issue. The sounds are pleasing and the theme is healing, so it is often appropriate."
0,Contrived and disconnected,"Reading this work, I had the feeling that Schlink had come up with several reasonably good ideas for short stories, but then unwisely decided to knit them together into a novel. The trouble is, they don't assemble well. The result is a contrived, stiff and disconnected effort, with the whole adding up to less than the sum of its parts. A failure, though briefly, here and there, an interesting failure."
0,Pretty but impractical,"My mom purchased this for my daughter and it is every bit as beautiful as it looks online. I was very excited to pull it out and wash it up...until I found out that everything, including the fitted sheet, is dry clean only. I don't have time for that, so we returned it."
0,Doesn't live up to its namesake,"I picked this book up with no knowledge about it; I just saw everyone reading it. I found it horrible; I had to make myself finish it.Basically, the leaps of logic made in the book are far out and unrealistic. I found the book to also be very anti-Catholic, and, being a Catholic, I found much of the text to be offensive and inaccurate. Anyone with a basic knowledge of Christian and Catholic history can punch holes through the plot so large that it becomes worthless to continue reading.This is not an accurate book or a historical expose as many believe it to be; it is at best a poor fictional story. My only regret is that many people pick up the book and read it, believing, as the author represents it to be, as a storyline imposed on a factual basis."
1,Great for injured cat!,"I have a cat who had surgery on his back leg, so he is no longer able to bend at the knee. This stair unit allows him to get up to the window and onto the bed. It is very sturdy, so he feels secure on it."
0,I could NOT believe it!,"I was all excited to receive my very BEST of Mungo Jerry! When it arrived, I played it thru and kept waiting for The Pushbike Song to play.....it wasn't there! I checked over the CD listing again and again....nope. I felt ripped....HOW can it be called the very best without his second biggest hit????....and yes, I know I should have checked before I ordered, but c'mon....some things in life should be a given and THIS is one. Speaking of life, mine will go on BUT I regret my purchase."
1,Nice Pan,"Nice quality but not quite as heavy or thick as our older ones we replaced. Still, we hope they will hold up as good, but time will tell."
1,"Great unit, a few shortcomings, nothing critical","It does what it is supposed to do. It supplied cranking power to a dead battery on a flooded engine in below zero conditions, no problems. It lost a star for me because of the cables and clamps... they just went undersized and cheap on this and it's disappointing. But, even as they are, the unit did work great, far beyond my expectations. I think I read some other reviews about shipping damage. Mine came triple boxed, perfect condition."
0,why the Music Business is seen as a joke by many,when a Act like this gets a record deal you know there are things going besides the music?Angie Martinez makes J-LO Come off like Chaka Khan by Comparrison&I Can Honestly say J-Lo AKA Jennifer Lopez is Tone Deaf.this Disc sounds like Every other Record that is out now.at least She has a Day Job?when Acts like this get Record Deals it makes the Business look even badder than it already does.
1,Yea - TV on the fly !!,TV - My wife loves this stuff & I enjoy it alot. Yea Amazon !!We enjoy TV on the fly without commercials. We picked this because really like the genre but the availability is the wonderful part of this experience !
0,"True? A Viewer from Finland, 17 years","When I saw this film for the first time, about three months ago, I started wondering was that the Doors that I fell in love with? It was so different than the Doors that I read about in the books, but I guess it was true, because John, Robby and Ray were all a part of the filmmakers. To me the movie was a shock, is that the way everything happened? I guess it was.Actors were good, music (of course) was good and the directing was good, but...something was missing."
0,HURRICANE EYES FALLS SHORT,"OKAY, IF YOU LIKED THUNDER AND LIGHTNING YOU WILL THINK THIS OFFERING(SANS S.D.I) IS NOT UP TO STANDARDS. THE SOLO'S ARE FLAT AND THE SONGS ARE JUST NOT AS CATCHY AS THE AFOREMENTIONED. IF YOU ARE A COLLECTOR ITS A GOOD ADDITION TO THE ARSENAL.MY SUGGESTION: DONT MAKE THIS YOUR FIRST PURCHASE . INSTEAD, GO FOR THUNDER IN THE EAST OR DISILLUSION. IF YOU LIKE HEAVIER METAL CHECK OUT THEIR LATER OFFERINGS, GHETTO MACHINE, OR ENGINE BOTH VERY COOL AND STYLISTICALLY DIFFERENT."
0,Rene Russo is a skinbag,"Yeah, thats right. She is a sagging old witch, and who needs to see this hag naked!"
0,price and disc errors make for disappointment,"Like alot of other NX fans looked forward to season 4. It is one of my favorite seasons and I preordered this in January. I was a bit annoyed to see the price so much lower now, but I was outright disgusted when I got my DVD's only to find 2 copies of disc 3 and no copy of disc 1. Now I have to return and wait who knows how long for a replacement and keep my fingers crossed that all 3 discs are in the package when the new one arrives. I'll continue to order the seasons as they are released but I won't preorder any more and will wait for the lower price. Overall I love NX and am happy to have my own copies of this beloved show, but each season has been a bit of a let down with the packaging issues, music and less than stellar way the discs are marked. At least in the end I'll have copies to watch as I want and not rely on reruns."
1,buy this cd,"What a gem! Guess what? There was good music before rock and roll and here it is. If you like lush, romantic sounds with a smattering of Italian thrown in,the Gaylords deliver. I wish I could find more of their stuff on cd."
1,"A quick, entertaining read.","Interesting from the very beginning, this book has several twists and turns. With witty dialogue and likable characters the pages turn all too quickly."
0,Save your money.,"I was very disappointed in this movie. Very poor acting throughout. While there is a plot, it is very amateurish in its development. The events are about as unrealistic as you can get. Don't get me wrong. The idea of a kid with flying shoes is fine with me, but the writing and direction made it seem like this was done by a couple of 10 year old kids. After destruction of private property, vandalism, and assault, nobody calls the police, only 911 to have the aunt taken to the hospital. This movie had the potential on so many levels to be so much better. Save your money and your time. Skip this one."
1,another great movie,I loved this movie! It's good to watch good movies. Wish hollywood would stop with the killing/sex and crap!a must see
0,"well it's a megadeth cd, but it's a bit sub par","I bought it just cause its new megadeth, however it is a bit lack luster for that band. There is only a few good songs on the cd. Megadeth is is not a commercial band as they are trying to be. Feel that this is Megadeth's weakest album ever."
0,"It doesn't suck, and that sucks!","Don't bother buying this, not worth ten dollars if you want a clean house. About the only thing it does is make noise and weighs a ton. It acts like it's clogged half the time. I even contacted Hoover and they said to ""make sure the hose isn't clogged."" This was brand new, so it shouldn't have a clog. So, I came to the conclusion that it doesn't suck, which sucks! I'm done with Hoover. They should recall this piece of sh@t for the inconvenience it causes."
0,Not great,"I really really liked the look of this phone. After two months, though, the phone's ringer stopped working consistently. Sometimes it rings and sometimes it doesn't. Most of the time, to get it to ring, it has to be on the actual cradle -- not real helpful for a cordless phone!"
1,Get Ready to Ship Out...,"Nothing can completely prepare you for the experience of basic training... but this book does contain some useful material. If you're completely clueless, this book can point you in the right direction. The most important part of being prepared for basic training is being in the best physical shape of your life before you join, of course, even if you're not, you will be able to pass the PT test by the end of basic. I can't remember exactly where the writer went to Basic Training, but every TRADOC post is a bit different, I went to Fort Knox, and it was the most hardcore experience of my life... it was crazy, and nothing can prepare you for the experience. At least this book might give you a little bit of confidence before you ship out."
1,A meditative delight,"Here are a few published reviews:""This album is built of contrasting elements reconciled in musical harmony. Natural and electronic sounds, water waves and sound waves, instruments of silicon and instruments of wood. This is music motivated by love of the power of sound, not by love of power over sound. Very restful !! Peaceful!! Headphones recommended!!""Laurie Spiegel Pioneering computer music sound designerGentle, meditative, and serene.......""One of the best albums of the year!!"".................... Adams has made a wonderful album where nature sounds actually work within the framework of the music. Inventive!!Wind and Wire Magazine"
0,7th heaven,seems like the show is nothingmore about the camdon kids sleeping with someone. they should of stopped about the 7 or 8 season
1,Strong Characters Make This A Winner,"Homicide detective, Tom McMichael is charged with investigating the brutal murder of 84 year old Pete Braga. Complicating the case is the fact that the McMichael and Braga families have a long standing feud, that includes violence on both sides. Parker does a wonderful job of introducing his characters to the reader without a lot of tedious details. I've read many of Parker's previous novels and it's his writing style that keeps me coming back. He tells a good story and keeps the pace moving at a good clip. His characters stay with me long after I've finished a book of his. I can still remember Silent Joe...one of my favorites. Tom McMichael will stay with me too. A decent guy trying to do a good job under difficult circumstances. A very enjoyable read."
0,Almost a Great Product but Ruined by Bratty Character,"I find it very disappointing that the creators of this product don't realize that an unspeakably bratty animated character ruins this product. The Jumpstart team is so loaded with technical talent and teaching savvy, but apparently they don't think that social skills matter, since the whole product is centered around a loud and sassy girl who is bad company for any child. The marketing team at Jumpstart apparently believes that their product won't sell if animated characters are courteous and supportive. I never buy their products anymore because I don't want to have to spend time reminding my son never to imitate the appalling behavior portrayed on Jumpstart."
0,service stinks,"I purchased following their promises of simplicity.It was for my aging sister, to be someting less complicatedthen setting up a computer.The reality is they set her up initially with long distance dial-up and then corrected it after she noticed it. Then calling for further tech (help?) she was told the computers were down, call back tomarrow. Calling back, she was put on hold 45 minutes before hanging up and re-dialing. Then again on hold for 25+ minutes before giving up again. Is this help, is this simple? william"
0,Not good for all types of sensitive skin.,I have friends that rave about this product. Unfortunately I found I was allergic to it and there is nothing worse then the itch of a new tattoo combined with a reaction itch.
1,MS Comfort Keyboard,"This keyboard like so many other Microsoft products is well made and durable. We use it for transcription work and after two years of constant typing for 10 hours a day, 6 days a week, it's still working flawlessly. This product is well worth the price."
1,Lindros Soars,"I needed to do a report on a famous person that I looked up to. My favorite hockey player of all time is Eric Lindros. So I went to my library to see if they had any information on him. To my surprise they had just got this book in. When I started to read I was very interested in seeing all the stuff that Eric had to go through to get to where he is today. The book showed me why I liked him so much. It wasn't just his speed, hardwork, and determination that I liked anymore it was also to see him on a personal level not just in the game of hockey."
0,Not the Original!,"If you are simply tring to research this unprecidented moment in space exploration, this photo-copied book will help you. I stress the item for sale is a B&W; copy-no glossy pages, no color photos.In my opinion, the item offered here is a cheap, inferior product."
0,Bad experience,"I added this as a backup to an older Oster that works great, and have been very disappointed with this one. It takes 10+ minutes to make a bad waffle. Perhaps it isn't working properly. Not sure."
0,"Christian praise musicians doing ""ethnic""","I have to say that, for all the study and admirable work that went into this project, I was rather stunned that Savae didn't understand how clearly unqualified they are to represent the style of this music. As another reviewer mentioned, they are unable to shed their operatic voices; I'd be even less generous and say that the slick, commercial style of a American Christian singer just doesn't cut it here. Beautiful music, embarassing performance. Perhaps you can submit these songs to Savina Yannatou or someone with a true mediterranean style so we can enjoy the fruits of your labor."
1,Excellent product,"Over time, I have purchased three of these and have not had a moments problem with any"
1,Very good book,"I designed shopping carts for 5 years. After I left that company, I saw this book. I bought it as a gift for my former boss who was the owner of the company that made shopping carts. I thought that he would get a kick out of it. Before I gave it to him, I decided to glance at a few pages and ended up reading through the whole book before I gave it to him. I sort of felt bad since the book is now officially used. He loved it anyway. It was interesting and it has inspired me to do something similar."
0,Pay what you get,"The handles that are glued, were apart, so As soon as I opened, I had to fasten them with electrical wires! The whole unit is built very cheap. I am using the unit after some repairs, waitng to be all apart to get a better unit next time. Don't recommend it."
0,simply mediocre.,"This is my third chic lit book after Bergdorf Blondes and Legally Blonde. I enjoyed reading the latter so I took a chance and bought Family Trust. Unfortunately, I wasn't really enjoy reading this one. The way Becca Reinhart's life being described on earlier chapter were simply vibrant, energetic and ongoing.. I enjoyed reading these part.. but when she had to drop everything in her life and followed what Emily has to say.. its just too good to be true."
1,Great Book for Toddlers,"Our three year old loves helicopters. He has so many toy helicopters of different sizes and this book came like an icing on the cake. He likes to look at the pictures there, name them and see what different helicopters are capable of."
1,Excellent protection,"I got this protector to save my PSP's screen (which already has a few scratches on it), and it works perfectly. It covers the entire screen, stays on pretty securely. The one gripe I have it is that dirt and stuff sometimes gets under and between the protector and the PSP. It's easily to clean off, but it's a little bit a nuisance. All in all, I highly recommend this."
0,No Anal,"This lube is only good for masturbation and vaginal, no anal (gay sex). I believe all lubrication must be versatile in for all ocassional, it does have a great sensation; however, the purpose that I potentially have for it, its not equipped for the job."
1,"Careful, it melts plastic","Use on metal, NOT PLASTIC! It will dissolve plastic quickly. Good for a leatherman. Bad for a swiss army knife. It did major cosmetic damage to the plastic handles! Guess I should have seen that coming. I wish it said this more clearly on the bottle.As a lubricant it works pretty well."
0,it just keeps going.....,"I had to read this book for summer reading but i was still some what excited to read it. I was extremely disappointed. Ellis is an awful writer. He uses the same words and phrases over and over making the book even more tedious and boring. He never stays on topic adn manages to take every interesting point in the book and drag it out to the point that any interest he manages to spark is gone.Although the book does cover the ""founding brothers"" well it's just written poorly. Honestly i did learn things but im sure if I picked up another book out there covering similiar material, it would be presented in a more interesting and less rambling way. Anything would be better than this book. It took me an entire weekend just to get through one of the chapters, the book is that tedious.I dont suggest this book at all unless you are extremely interested in the topic and can manage to get over the horrible way it is written."
1,Camus as Robert F. Kennedy's Muse,"After reading ""The Myth of Sisyphus"", I begin to understand my hero, Robert F. Kennedy better now.It was during the years after the tragic death of his brother, President John F. Kennedy, that Robert was finally free for the first time in his life to struggle to create his own identity and sense of purpose.In his journey of self examination that followed John's assassination, Robert explored the writings of ancient Greeks, beginning with ""The Greek Way"" by Edith Hamilton.But it was in the existentialist writings of Albert Camus that Bobby Kennedy finally found a way of thinking that helped him to make sense of life's absurdities.For anyone who is facing some difficult or very strange challenges in their life, I strongly recommend a serious look at Albert Camus' writings, beginning with ""The Myth of Sisyphus"".It's not optimism, to be sure, but it does help one to make some sense out of troubling times."
0,BAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I THINK THIS MOVIE WAS VERY BAD. I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE REAL BRADY BUNCH!!!!
0,Far too senstive for near a kitchen,"This is way too sensitive for use anywhere near a kitchen. I have one installed outside the kitchen, and it goes off every time I make toast, saute, or broil. Sometimes just turning on a burner on the stove is enough to set it off.The hush feature is OK, but it will keep going off every five minutes or so as long as you're cooking. Since it's hard-wired to the other smoke detectors, the entire house is filled with screeching on all the false alarms."
0,did not dye my sweater,"I had ordered this based on a few reviews i saw, but when I used it to dye a sweater I've had for 10 years it did not work. Bought another brand of dye and it worked great on the same sweater. And i followed the directions to a t. So i do not recommend this product."
1,babymom,"I love this seat, our son had the Evenflo Aura and it was a piece of junk. Our son loves this new seat, he used to cry when he was being put into the old car seat now he gets in this seat with no problem this is one of the best ones. The price may be a little high but it is worth every penny and it will last him for quite awhile. We looked at alot of seats but this one was the right one for us. Our son doesn't mind going anywhere now, he gets in and he is very comfortable. It is the Cadilac of carseats, and it has extra features that are nice, the recline and the adjustable headrest are great. Also the straps do not twist or get all out of shape, the nice thing on this one is that you can release the straps and you don't have to work or bend your child's arms to get them out it is very parent and child friendly. I highly recommend this product."
0,A WASTE OF TIME,The first chapter was the best chapter of the book. So after you read the first chapter just pop The Players Club in your DVD player and don't bother to read the rest of the book. Very disappointed with this one Shannon Holmes.
0,Circumcision stance teaches social conformity,"Great Expectations happens to teach how to conform to societal standards and subject our babies to amputations so that their girlfriends can continue the same sexists attitudes and to perpetuate locker room bullying of intact and natural bodies. Perhaps it should also teach us to give our daughters breast enlargement surgeries before they are too old to remember it so that we can conform to the assumption that men like larger breasts, or we should perform labiaplasties on our baby daughters so they look like porn stars or barbies for their future boyfriends. Way to go Jones and Jones.This is in reference to this snippet: """"In America, many women are used to, and prefer, the circumcised look, and we can only assume that they assume their son's future girlfriends will too. Some dads worry that their sons will be teased if their looks don't conform to the majority of boys in the locker room."""""
1,Love It!,Putting it together is a snap! I bought this item purposely to take my 5 month old to the beach. It was a great investment. He played and napped in the tent without any problems. It provided shade and kept him cool throughout the entire time.
1,Alba - a pleasant surprize,"I bought this cd after hearing Cocciante on ""A Christmas in Vienna"" DVD. When I got it in the mail, I was a bit disappointed that it was made in 1975. But I took a chance and kept it. I'm very glad I did. The album definitely reflects music from an earlier time - there's no disco or hard rock however. Most of the songs are simple, yet beautiful, sung from the heart. Cocciante's voice can be a bit harsh at times but usually his voice matches the music quite well. He is accompanied mainly by piano. I wouldn't recommend this album to everyone, but if you're sick of the same old stuff (with overdone instrumentals, pretentious lyrics, etc) this album may be a pleasant surprize."
1,The best jim`s movie,"Tom Waits is great,John Lurie is great,Roberto Begnini is a star, the most illarious film I ever seen"
1,The chicken as art...,"This hefty little book is a surprise on every page. I've always known chickens were beautiful, as all fowl, poultry and gamebirds are. But these lovely macros of the breed standards are really just incredible, from a fellow writer/photographer's point of view. Whatever your interest in these birds, be it a curiosity or a hobby, you will love this book.I also like the size. Easy to find on my overloaded bookshelves. So kudos to Mr. Green-Armytage, for a job well done. Chickens aren't the most cooperative subjects for a photo shoot. I just wonder how many hours to photograph plus travel time he has into this!"
1,"Wonderful, campy throw-back to the 60's and the wicked ways of show business! Watch Patty Duke's beads when she sings!","The most unintentionally funny movie about the road to fame and fortune. So bad, it's good. Wish they had a soundtrack available for it (maybe they do) because the songs are as laughable as the dialogue. Great camp and has been imitated, but never duplicated. There is only one Valley of the Dolls!"
1,"Okay book, daughter was indifferent.","A little different than the other Eric Carle books, but still decent. Not the kids' favorite, but they can't all be! Gave this as a gift, but read it to my daughter first to see what she thought:) Definitely recommend the Brown Bear/Panda Bear/Polar Bear books over this one, but still a nice book."
1,one of my favourite movies of all time... brilliant....,"i love wes craven.... he actually went ghetto and decided to put blacks in a horror flick and they all dont die!!!! (in trying not to be racist but its true)this movie is just crazy... it makes me wonder about the old lady down the road... she does look crazy...anyways.... 'fool' is the hero of this movie and he tries to save the neighbourhood from the evil landlords that have something nasty going on between... (you have to watch the movie to figure it out.... its NASTY!!!!!)anyways pick this movie up if you like creepy, NASTY!!!, and humour...."
1,Helpful and useful one for my daily life,I was recomended by somebody and find out it's very useful in my daily work.
1,Perfect,"I bought this for my three year old son and he loves it. It keeps his attention, which is hard to do these days.He loves Thomas the train and this movie was a hit! Thank you! Fast shipping and excellant packaging."
1,I must have been lucky!,"I received the MC1008 for Christmas last year (2002) and must have been extremely lucky because mine still works! In fact, I was searching Amazon to buy one as a gift for someone this year. It's true that the thing eats up batteries like crazy when playing a CD, but I almost exclusively use it for the radio function. With just playing the radio and only using it when showering, the batteries last about 4 months.As I said, it's approaching a year old and all of the functions still work fine.As for the person who claimed that the manual said not to use it near water, that line was taken out of context. The manual says if you use a plug-in adapter don't use it near water. I'm guessing this is a safety precaution, not a wear-and-tear issue."
0,BIG TIME DISAPPOINTMENT!!,"Please save your money! Clay being compared toElvis is a big joke! The guy can sing, butit seems as if he's being made out to be morethan his is. Nice voice, but needs work. TheCD in my opinion is a waste of money."
1,The Breaks of the Game,"With The Breaks of the Game, Halberstam demonstrates that in sports, and in life, there are moments in time, and they seldom last as long we want them to. Definitely enjoyed the book; if you're an NBA junkie it's a vital read. Anyone who enjoys stories about competitive people should also give it a shot."
0,Ehh? Could be bigger.,"I am a minimalist to the fullest, but this book simply lacks depth. The ""blueprints"" are hardly viewable, let alone descriptive. Most of the structures resemble eachother and are spare, without furnishings or signs of life. I would recommend the book, ""PREFAB"" by Allison Arieff for bigger pictures, broader concepts and more in depth explanations. I suppose they were making a point by making the size of the book compact, but the few times I was impressed with a structure I would scour the three or so pages devoted to it and then it was over, leaving me wanting much more. Try classics like, ""Pierre Koenig"", by James Steele or ""Julius Shulman: Architecture and Its Photography"" by Peter Gossel. Ta Ta"
1,So comfortable!,I have a supportive mattress but it lacks softness that I sometimes desire as well - this topper in combination with my firm mattress puts me to sleep in record time.I used to toss and turn at night and wake up with pressure points on my hips from the mattress - no longer.I sleep like a kid again and it is *awesome*!
0,Enough material for a 15 minute SNL,"A parody on James Bond films. Probably the best moments were Mimi Rodgers in tight outfits, and the pre-frozen Austin in the '60s; complete with cool period music, cars etc.There were some genuinely funny bits, but the comedic timing was too looong, and there was just lots of ""dumb"" stuff in between those funny moments. Could be I just don't get it...but I think I do."
1,Perfect Burn Rate So Far,"Can't understand what all the whining is about. I bought a spindle of Memorex Blanks and have had two bad burns so far and I was barley into the Rack. I use WINAMP PRO to burn in MP3 Format at a Bitrate of 256 kbps. These Sony Blanks have been perfect so far. I set the spindle of Memorex Blanks and the spindle of Sony Blanks next to each other, if you look at the color of the Discs from the side, the Sony Blanks just look like they are of better quality (Deeper Color) I highly recommend these. There are better Blanks out there of course. Let's face it, you get what you pay for. High-end single Blanks can cost you over a dollar each !!!!"
1,Very Precise,"Wiha 26591 Precision Inch Nut Driver Set, 8 PieceLike it says, precision, and that's what they are. They catch hold of some of the smallest of nuts. Sometimes you have to pay more to get more and these tools will do a great job. This set does not come with a pouch, but you can order one for about 8 dollars at Amazon or the container they come in works great in my tool box."
0,Ugh! So So!!,"Poorly made product - Motor gears (plastic) broke while cutting meats and fruit. Did not last long. I'd opt for an alternate, the next time."
1,classic - must read & REread,"This is a classic and a must read and reread for anyone seriously interested in examining modern claims to miraculous charismata. As a scholar and a christian man, Warfield has few peers. Jack Deere and others have tried to counter his arguments. Be sure you read Warfield for yourself. You should also read (for a Charismatic perspective) Jack Deere's book, Surprised By the Spirit. Then reread Warfield and decide if you think Deere adequately relayed and answered Warfield's arguments. Jack Deere's effort is the best so far, but he falls far short IMHO.This classic deals with miracles in a broad sense related to the modern Charismatic controversy. One noteworthy peculiarity of this book is Warfield's detailed examination of miracles in history and various groups."
1,Great place to start,"Excellent practical advice. It really helped me get my head around the complexities of egg donation to create a family. I am in New Zealand and although some of the American references didn't apply, the issues are universal and addressed with a lot of care."
1,Interesting Set-Up,"One Two Buckle My Shoe is one of the more contrived of Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot novels but its twisted loops are definately part of the fun. The author does play around with politics in her conservative, often very naive, way but handles it much more smoothly than she did in her early twenties spy novels. The solution to the killer is both predicatable and satisfying as Christie crawls right up to the preposterous and then pulls back just a little. This is one of the Poirot novels that could have used Hastings a foil and his prescence is sadly missed, particularly as everyone at a certain dentist's office on a particular morning has something to hide and it would have been fun to read Hastings switching prime suspects with each new revelation. All in all, not a classic Christie but an interesting one."
0,STUPID!!,"Worst movie EVER... Could NOT even hold my interest for the first 10 minutes. I actually tried to watch it for 30 minutes but had to shut it off!! Bad, bad movie!!"
0,The Coven was right,"Luckily, I read ""Industrial Magic"" before I read ""Dime Store Magic"", so I know that Paige Winterbourne doesn't remain the immature, brain-dead dweeb she is in ""Dime Store.""The Coven didn't think Paige was mature enough to be Savannah's guardian and I have to agree with them. Savannah outshines Paige in both survival skills and decision-making abilities. Maybe she should be Paige's guardian.This review based on only the first half of the book - when I finally became so frustrated with Paige's childish behavior, I tore up the book and threw it in the garbage - only the second book in over 40 years that I've deliberately thrown away."
1,nascae simracing,this game is the most fun game you'll ever need and play for the pc..online gameplay is great.this game lets you make your own setup and has an in-depth setup menu..its bigif you doubt me ask any nascar fan and they will tell you that this game its the most have if you're into nascar games.
0,Sound half good,After some very meticulous shopping I decided on the Shure E2c Earphones. My first problem was that the supplier shipped a different model with no real explanation for the difference or the spec difference between the units. My second problem was with the earphones themselves. Right out of the packaging I was disappointed to discover that only one channel worked. Almost nothing from the right channel unless I had the volume level at full and then it was only barely audible. I tried the earphones with various sound systems with same result. Called Shure and they told me to return them for a replacement set. This review will be continued. The left side seemed to sound just fine but I am concerned with Shure's quality control. How difficult can it be to verify sound coming from both channels in a set of earphones before you package them up in an impenetrable plastic shield? I expected more from such a renowned company.
1,A must for anyone getting into unconventional marketing,This book provides great examples for selling goods & services without a huge investment.Provided our company with enough ideas to get started right away!
0,The Horse says it all...,"I can only assume that Stanton, Blanchett and Turturo took a wrong turn down the corridor from the canteen and walked into an adjacent studio, not noticing the sign on the door which read, ""Quiet please, turkey in progress"". This is utter rubbish. Art house vibe? Come on. That only makes sense if you believe that art house cinema shows films which are badly lit, poorly paced and badly acted. Depp reprises his 'Chocolat"" role to equally tiresome effect, while Harry Dean Stanton looks like an actor who can't wait for his character to be deported East by the Nazis and save him from further career trauma. I was interested that the Paris flat appears to be located next door to the city aquarium; during love scenes, the wooden lovers are serenaded by singing whales outside the window -now that is Arthouse, and accounts for this review's only star.The horse defecating on stage says it all; this really is a stinking heap"
0,Avoid this at all costs,"Despite hyperbolic publicity claims by the producer, who features himself and his name all over the place, this must be the most truly awful visual record of a performance ever offered for public sale. It looks as if it had been shot using a static home video camera producing images so weak that I defy anyone to identify a single member of the band - and no personnel, composers or arrangers are provided: truly unforgiveable for a release that is aimed at a specialised viewer. And it's no use buy their companion CDs of the concert as they don't give the complete personnel either. An outrageous rip-off at such a price. - David Meeker."
0,Zero Gravitation!,"Sorry Mr. Shalalalala but it seems that ""The sixth sense"" should stay your one and only extraordinary movie for years. Neither ""Unbreakable"" nor ""Signs"" couldn't save me from sleeping in my seat. Although even the last human being should know where the corn signs really come from let me please give you an advice: harvest your low corn-story and look out for a mill. Take the flour then, add some water and salt, put the mixture into an oven and give it a couple of minutes. The new result will taste much better."
0,"Disappointing ""sound track""","The film Dead Man, is an interesting and sometimes hauntingly absurd film..verging on the philosophical, but without the music by Neil Young, it probably wouldn't be so successful. On the other hand, the music without the images is weak and not freestanding as it's recorded in this so called ""sound track"" CD. Even though Neil Young's expressionistic guitar playing from the film, still resonates as a powerful ""image"" in my memory, the CD falls way WAY short of the actual filmatic material. The film, as it is, with both image and sound IS almost perfect, almost great."
0,"Dirk Pitt + story idea == same song, second verse","Typical Dirk Pitt book, follows the formula, provides action and technical commentary. Nothing special within that universe, nothing special outside it. Read it while on a backpacking trip when I ran out of my primary reading material, discarded portions as I went -- don't miss having the copy of the book."
1,A great tool,My husband and I have used our blender several times now and so far it has been great. I use it to make really good light cheesecake and my husband loves to make fluffy omelets and fruit smoothies with it. I've even ground turkey to make patties. It's super easy to clean and store.
0,Real-ease neck and shoulder relaxer,"This product does absolutely NOTHING for the neck or shoulders! Save your money! All of the claims, this product, says it will do, are false."
0,Failed 2nd time I used it,"I was very excited to get this after having to get a cast. I followed all the instructions and was very gentle with this item. While putting it on the 3rd time, the rubber cuff tore making it totally unusable. I'm very displeased with the quality."
0,In the WRONG KEYS.,"I love the history and the pictures in this book about Judy, but I wanted it for practical purposes. The authors of the book could have taken a day or two to transpose these songs into Judy's keys, but instead EVERYONE who buys the book has to do that themselves. Think of all the duplicate hours of transcription.I bought this book so I would NOT have to pay someone to transcribe these songs. Now I may have to pay someone to transpose them. I am very disappointed."
1,excellent drill...but:...,"This is a great drill. Durable, powerful and it will probably last forever. It's clearly a professional quality tool. Downside is: it's very heavy. with constant use it can tire your wrists. Word of caution. If the bit you use with this drill bites the wood too hard and gets stuck, the drill is so powerful it will very quickly jerk your wrist around and could potentially cause injury. So be aware of what you're doing. Still, it's a valuable tool and great for heavy-duty drilling needs. I'd recommend a lighter-duty drill for everyday stuff..."
0,Be prepared to lose the volume control,"I have had this product for 3 years and now the volume control is gone. On top of the programming being a trial, don't the engineers know that the volume control is the most used button on the control? Apparently not. Now I have to use the tuner remote becuz I hate the idea of spending $400 just to increase the volume."
1,rechargable 18volt batteries that fit Milwaukee,My Milwaukee 18 volt drill batteries would no longer hold a charge. This has been my workhorse drill/ driver. The new batteries charge up fine. They fit the charger and the drill and work great.
1,nice purchase,"While all of the olives were tasty, some were not as ""pretty"" -- but I bought them for the flavor. I tend to like black olives better than green; however, the green ones in this package are downright outstanding in flavor. I, too, will buy these again. They were a ""what the heck"" purchase the first time."
1,Perfect for me!,"I agree with the other reviews. I have the Olympus SP-565uz camera and this case is perfect for holding the camera, spare batteries and memory card. Agreed, there is not room for camera operating booklet, cleaning kit or filters. This case is well made and nicely padded and is perfect for those of us who don't want to carry around a camera suitcase. I often will use the back zippered area to carry my ID, ATM and a few bucks and then hang my keys on the clip (not shown) and I'm set to go!"
1,Suzanne Somers' Slim and Sexy Forever,"Not as good as her first book but has some good advise on cortisol control a real issue with both men and women. Especially women starting or going through menopause. I have been a Pharmacist for 30 years. I have seen many diets come and go, and Suzanne recommendation are was I teach my customers every day. Well worth buying. I have purchased 20 book to lend out to my customers so they can learn about themselves."
1,Best of the Series (So Far),"I've read the Mr. Putter & Tabby books with both of my children. It's a wonderful series for the beginning reader. This title is my favorite of the entire series. Mr. Putter has a cold and remembers what made him feel better when he was a boy. Chicken soup, some hot tea and an adventure book loaned by Mrs. Teaberry's dog, Zeke make this cold worth having. It perfectly captures just how much fun a sick day can be."
0,"No widescreen, no sale!","How dare they, in this day and age forsake widescreen TV owners and others that wish to have movies in thier original aspect ratio.I wanted the first Gidget movie, I have it taped on VHS in Pan and Scan and wanted a modern 16:9 trasnfer of this Cinemascope film.Shame on Columbia/Tristar for not doing this the right way. Shame on them!This will never be bought by me unless they release a widesceen version like they should've in the first place.You would think that the studios would learn thier lesson from the fullscreen only Willy Wonka fiasco.If you must put Pan and Scan on DVD, make sure the widescreen version is also available (preferably on a seperate release).This potential sale has been cancelled."
0,Got stalker?,"I know people are going to show up at my house with pitch forks, but I really wasn't into this book. The idea of someone constantly watching me, even when I'm sleeping, is not love to me but stalking. I also found the story rather predictable."
0,Poor audio quality,"Returned first unit same day purchased, second unit better than first, however audio is 'scratchy'. GE non-responsive, replaced second unit with purchase from other manufacturer."
1,Xtreme 320-Disc case,The Xtreme 320-Disc case is a well constructed case. It should last for years. A GOOD CHOICE !
0,Does not last,"Upon recieving this Lenmar battery, I inserted it into the Panasonic DMC-TZ3 charger and it readily charged with no problem. (Some reviews I read indicated a problem with this Lenmar battery fitting into the charger which I did not encounter.) I then put it in the camera and it has functioned as well as the original equipment. I have not used the camera enough to determine if there is any significant difference in usage time between it and the original Panasonic battery, but it is certainly a bargain price.UPDATE: After using this battery for a year it started not to hold a charge very long and eventually it would hardly work at all, so after usage, I found tis battery to be unsatisfactory and not that good a bargain. I am still using the original battery taht came with the camers from over 2 years ago. And I recently bought another backup battery on Amazon which seems to be working fine."
0,Cruisers,"We have a power boat but found this book to be very informative & helpful. We are planning our trip, have not been to the Chesapeake in about 25 years, and have found this book the best yet in our preparations. We like to anchor out and this book is informative not specifically focusing jumping from marina to marina like many guides do."
1,A curly must have!,It's great for detangling curly hair. My husband has straight hair and also loves to use it to brush out his tangles.
1,I Know This Much Is True,"Wonderful! This book gives you a very realistic portrayal of the dynamics between twins or multiples. Thoroughly enjoyable and insightful, this leaves you, also, with many things to ponder once you're done reading."
1,Epic,"This album has two songs, one approx. 11 mins, the other is approx. 18 minutes. These two songs are so epic in scope, it's quite hard to find something to even compare them to, you truly have to hear it for yourself to believe it.I suppose if you're used to Godspeed, you know what to expect. If you're not though, and you just wandered here, you should most definitely check these guys out. I dont think you'll be disappointed."
1,almost as good as the first,"This was almost as good as their first album. Several of the songs sounded a little darker, Maybe a bit on the ""negative"" side, but I still liked it."
1,"If you like David Wilcox, Phil Keagy, etc this is a must!","Amazing harmonics and fingering,this album floored me the first time I heard it. Not just a demonstration of guitar prowess, every song is good. A must for any listener with good taste, both guitar fans and not."
1,the most colorful kids show ever made,I watched this when i was a kid in the late 80's and 90's and I still watch this beyond wack show. Witchiepoo and her monsters are absolutely the best characters of the show. $@) 420 4ever!
1,I liked it a lot,"I saw the movie before I read the book and I enjoyed the movie a whole lot better. The movie left me a bit overwhelmed, like imagine being hit by a blast of wind. Ralph Fiennes was wonderful as usual and the sweeping music was a wonderful addition to the movie."
0,Not Airline Approved-False Advertising,"The information states that this product will work with US Airways. But the height is 17"" with a wire making it impossible to bend it down to the U.S. Airways maximimum height of not more than 15"". I called Sherpa three times-no one answered in their Customer Services Section. On the fourth try, I got someone in account (no one from Customer Service picked out). The Accounting Person verified that this size was too big for most airlines.Petco required that I had to bring the bags back with a copy of the receipt from their confirmation (since I don't have a printer, that was difficult). But they eventually gave me my money back.Buyer, be aware. You can't use these bags on airplanes."
0,Not up to snuff,"I'm usually a huge Stephanie Laurens fan and a fan of the Cynster series. This book however is really lacking her usually style and humour. You know in the first 10 pages how it's going to turn out --- there's a semi-interesting mystery (ala Amanda Quick) thrown in the middle, but that's the only interesting piece in the book at all. I almost stopped reading it 1/4 of the way through because it was just boring and completely predictable (in an overdone, not comfort food) kind of way. Here's hoping her next book is better..."
0,HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT,"I ORDERED 6 OF THEM FOR CHRISTMAS GIFTS AND PICKED ONE UP FOR MYSELF THIS MORNING AT WALMART. I RUSHED HOME SO EXCITED TO LISTEN TO IT AND WAS HEART BROKEN. I EXPECTED TO HEAR THAT WONDERFUL VOICE I GREW TO LOVE ON AMERICAN IDOL AND IT WAS FAR FROM IT. ALL I HEARD ON THIS ALUM WAS 2 DECENT SOUNDING SONGS. THE REST IS A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. WHY RUBEN THINKS HE HAS TO TURN INTO A RAPPER OR HIP HOT STAR IS BEYOND ME. I DID NOT VOTE FOR A RAPPER NOR A HIP HOP ARTIST. I FEEL IN LOVE WITH A MAN THAT COULD GIVE YOU CHILLS WITH THAT BALLARD SINGING VOICE. IF HE WANTS TO SING HIP HOP SONGS HE NEEDS TO REALIZE HE DOES NOT HAVE THE VOICE NOR THE TALENT TO KEEP UP WITH THE COMPETITION OUT THERE RIGHT NOW AND HE IS GOING TO TAKE A FAST RIDE DOWN HILL QUICK. RUBEN IF YOU READ THIS I WANT YOU TO KNOW I WISH YOU ALL THE LUCK IN THE WORLD HONEY, BUT I THINK YOU ARE LOSING A LOT OF FANS WITH THIS ALBUM. I AM SAD TO SAY THAT I WILL HAVE TO CALL AND CANCEL MY ORDER WITH THAT ONLINE MUSIC STORE."
0,NFS most disappointing AI,"The game can be quite enjoyable to play, but extremely aggravating when 20 second lead times are erased because you're not allowed to win by that big of a margin. If you outsmart or out drive the computers cars you will see them granted acceleration speeds that can only be measured in Mach, and the cornering ability of a cheetah.The recovery times of the AI's cars when tricked or pushed into obstacles seems like a huge hand follows them and quickly corrects any mishaps. When you find yourself losing because you nick some corner within 100 feet of the finish, but had been in the lead until then, you want to chuck the cd's out the window. I used to be a fan of NFS series, but this installment has me doubting I'll every purchase it again."
1,One of the best books written about caring for each other!!!,"When my wife bought me this book, I was touched that the authors could bring across such strong feelings with a few pictures and words. I enjoyed this so much I bought it for my Mother for Christmas!! She is a reading teacher and will surely enjoy sucha great book for children. Besides all that, the message from this book is just the ones we would want our children to understand and learn!!"
0,It's going back to the store.,"I bought this item because it boasted 12 amps and ""the strongest"" suction available. Sure, it picks up dirt. However, it is EXTREMELY loud! My children literally cried when I turned it on. Second, after you turn the unit off half the stuff falls back onto the floor. A complete waste of money. My Shark died after three years, but I'm going to get another one anyway."
0,How To Listen To This Recording:,"I bought it. I listened to it. I opened my window and threw the disc out into the yard. 'Nuff said.""One star"" is 3/4 of a star too much. Sounds like watered down covers without benefit of any variation or originality. If you want new variations on old tunes, find a copy of the Devo Muzac album."
0,Not the quality,"Not the quality one might think for the price. I received the set in a box, and one of the canisters was oval at the top instead of round for the lid to fit. With very little pressure, I was able to reshape the top! It is 18/0 and not 18/8. There are other stainless steel canisters of higher quality for the same price.... I'm returning these and going for one of them."
1,Easy to use.,"I am an occasional user of the Logitech 2,3 Ghz Cordless presenter. I use it for safety meetings and Basketball officials clinics. I find it very easy for the occasional user to master. I am looking for other chances to use this tool."

0,book for toddlers!,"Got this for my 6 year old grandson. And I think I was more disappointed than he was. I expected more than just pictures with one word on a page! This was a book maybe to share with a toddler, but no kids in Kindgergarten will be very impressed. Think twice before you buy it1"
0,Street fighter /Beyblade meets Gundam??!!,This entire series is lame. It's embarassing enough to even have the name Gundam attatched to it. Ignore this series if you are a true Gundam fan. 'Nuff said.
0,A let down,"If you like the game and are a fan. then buy this DVD, but don't expect much because it doesn't explain anything and a lot of things counterdict what is going on in the game. IE the marker size in the DVD compared to the game. And also the fact that they could not come close to the marker in the movie not so in the game. And how the infection got aboard ship. its different from the game to the DVD. I hope the get it together before the next movie"
0,I don't know what it is,"It might be the annoying characters, maybe it's the amatuerish acting, the paranoia of the previous generation might be the attraction or it might be the fact one of the characters in the film actually assualts a truck filled with chickens but I can't not watch this film.I just wouldn't pay a lot to watch this film."
0,Didn't Work,"I bought this product because of all the great reviews. I used it all through out my pregnancy every day twice a day. Didn't work...I started seeing stretch marks on my sides and belly. Plus I used it on my stretch marks I had before, wanted them to fade..no luck."
1,ABSOLUTELY WORTH THE MONEY!!!,"The faucet filter is made the same way (probably the same place) as the main competitor. But this version(""complete"") is worth gold! We have saved soooo much in plastic bottles and new coffee makers. I love it. The threads should be brass, like the less expensive version, but outside of that, there is nothing better. The choice of filter, stream, or spray is what sets this faucet filter apart. I can get them to last about 2 years (if it is NOT used as a handle to move the faucet around). Have tried the less expensive version and hate it. It simply doesn't work very well. So save yourself the annoyance and buy the better version, treat it well, clean the faucet screen every month or two, DON'T use it as a handle, and you will be satisfied."
0,Not consistent!,"I realize overall trends are more important than anything else, but, I'm pretty unhappy with just how much this scale varies. It can vary weighing yourself twice by up to 8 pounds! It's really hard to track trends when you dont know if the number you get it +/- 8 pounds at any given time.I've owned it a couple years, and it's got other flaws - it chews through batteries of the expensive watch type, and i've had to open it several times to clean the circuit board inside with alcohol- it gets wet and when the water dries it reads Err or E untill I take it apart."
1,Best movie ever,"I love this movie. Had it before, but someone seemed to have wanted it more than me....lol. So I had to purchase another one. This is a great movie. I know it almost verbatim. The songs, the actors and actresses everything just told a story of the life back then and what they had to go through to make it or what they thought they had to go through to make it in the music industry. Also very good price and shipped in a timely manner."
0,Highway Robbery,"Why are we obliged to buy two in one? Most of us have read the first book many years ago and have been waiting for a sequel. Well we finally get it and must have the first one with it and in hard cover to boot! Highway robbery to all fans of Sharon Green. Why not have a paperback of book two and be reasonable to all her fans?! Until then, I will not buy this outrageous price of a hard cover book. Give us a break!"
0,SICKENING!,"This thing looks like it was ghost-written by any of a number of leftist losers -- Al Franken, Michael Moore, take your pick -- whose asinine beliefs were dumped by the roadside where they belonged when the Bush administration finally took the White House away from the nightmarish fiasco of the Clintons. I like the Bizarro comic well enough, but if these are Piraro's true political beliefs, then he should be ashamed of himself."
0,Songs of Celebration & Love for Weddings,I thought these were a very poor choice of possible wedding songs. I was very disappointed with this item.
0,Where is the rest?!,"I paid for ONE YEAR! I got the first three magazines, and then they just stopped coming in the mail! Where is the rest?!"
0,horrible motor sound,"This created the most annoying motor sound I have ever heard. Maybe we had a defective unit or I have a rare sensitivity, but the frequency of the noise made me feel ill. I couldn't stand to be in the room with it on. It hurt my ears, it hurt my head. It did not sound soothing or natural. We returned it."
1,Something a little different,"Its not that often that you get to read a book about someone being summoned to close up a hole to ""heck"". Nice mix of humans and non-humans. Talking cat is a hoot."
1,off to a good start,"I'll have to agree that when Stackpole left FASA a LOT of the magic when with him. There are several talented authors still write in the BT story line such as Keith, Charrette and others. ROC is putting a word limit on the books now, so that's hurting the story line & characters.I gave it 4 stars because it's his first Battletech book and there's always room for improvement. Yes the characters could have had a bit more depth in them and it could have been a little longer, but ROC sets the limit. Against it was a solid story line that needs some polishing done.I'd like to see Mike Stackpole back writing more Battletech!"
0,"OK, but not their best","There are a few decent songs here, but the special energy that Supertramp had on all their classic albums is gone here, and this is becoming a bit annoying at times, particularly Rick's writing which by now has gotten lazy. With a title like ""Put On Your Old Brown Shoes"", you just KNOW it's going to be some lame pseudo-jazz uptempo thing by Rick. Hodgson's stuff is starting to get whiny rather than positive - ""Crazy"" and ""C'est Le Bon"" are decent songs with nice melodies and hooks, though less original than his offerings on previous albums. The only song that was even a moderate hit, ""It's Raining Again"" is a decent song, but compared to previous albums, it's more of a jingle than anything else, with not-so-great lyrics (come on you little fighter / no need to get up-tighter). Overall, the lyrics are dark and despairing, and point the way to Roger's departure from the band, which goes out with a whimper not a bang."
0,"I don't see any results, don't like the medicine smell","Following a surgery I had a lot of hair loss due to stress to the system and harsh medicines in the hospital and after care. My hair dresser noticed the problem with my hair and recommended this product. I've always trusted her opinion and decided to give it a try.I just finished my first bottle of daily use. I don't see any difference in the amount of hair I see in the drain after I wash my hair, nor do I notice any additional fullness in. In addition to lack of perceptible results I don't like the smell (medicine-like somewhat minty smell, reminded me of mouthwash). And it is expensive!I just finished the first bottle and it will be my last.Ali Julia review"
0,not happy,My little dog is very used to having her teeth cleaned -- she likes it. She was not that happy with the gel but she still allowed me to clean her teeth. I didn't see any improvement in her teeth and I found it very difficult to use -- getting it out of the container onto the finger brush was just impossible. I had to open it and put it on a little plate and then dip the finger brush into it -- too fussy for my life. I didn't like the smell either.It's Feb 17 and I have gone back to her usual tooth paste and she and I are both happier. She likes the taste of her old paste and I prefer the efficiency of how much easier it is to use.
1,About time.....,"I'm not only looking forward to seeing the various adventures, but the scenery and the Ferrari 308 GTS is what made this show so attractive to me.Hurry, September 7th - you're just too far away!....."
0,Can't seem to get the address correct!,Why do you keep sending this to Grampa when it was ordered and directed to go to Grandaughter? Not a nice gift when it never comes to the correct address. She even lives in a different town and the address was changed twice.Please help her?
1,Awesome Game! Best since Trivial Pusuit - a Must Own!,Bought this game several months ago and we have had a blast playing it. I'm a big fan of Trivial Pursuit and this is the next great game. Buy it - you will never regret it.
0,Slow Trip To Nowhere...,"Hmmm... Maybe I missed something or just don't get it, but this album is as irritating (...), all 10 songs bleeding into one another in a dissonant, clattering, droning mess. Guitars saw, drums pound and like the jazz song accompanying my worst nightmare, everybody plays something different all at the same time, singer Shawn yowling over the racket with all the charm of a flea-bitten cur that perpetually humps your leg. Call me a ""throwback,"" but there's something endearing about music with verses, choruses, melody, and a sense of purpose. These guys sound like they're making it up as they go along and for all we know, maybe they are. If your idea of a good time is an entire disc of variations on The Stooges' ""L.A. Blues"" (as much as you may love them, you have to admit that song blows chunks) performed by James White in the throes of a Tourette's attack, contact Estrus immediately.. (...)"
1,Dinos live on!!,"My grandson has been into dinosaurs since he was about 1 1/2; I think his first words were the names of the dinosaurs, especially from the Jurassic Period. He has every kind and size of dinosaur on the market, so when (for his fifth birthday) he told me he wanted a set for him to play with at my house I was really at a loss at what kind of set to get for him until I saw this one on-line. He loves it! The dinosaurs are perfectly sized to hold and move around the play mat; they can hide behind trees and rocks; and the tub is most convenient for storage, and the right size for AJ to carry it to where he wants to play with it in my home. You can't go wrong with this set of dinosaurs!"
0,Don't Do It,They will not hold air. Just a little bit of pressure makes the plug pop out and open. You will not be able to use them more than one minute.
0,Easily one of the least appealing,"As a Sinead O'Connor admirer for lots of years, I must say that this new piece of 'work' is incompetent. Apparently, people eaither love it or hate it, and I most definitely hate it. The problem is even though its a nice tune, it doesnt go anywhere, and seems very lazy and uninspired. You cant deny that. I agree that she has lost some of her earlier spunk, but this new single really crosses the line and shows her to be talentless. Please do NOT purchase this single, as all long time Sinead fans have more or less washed their hands off her with this release. Very disturbing. The CD cover is ugly too, as you can see."
0,NOT GOOD AT ALL,"This straightener only works for about three months before not heating up anymore and breaking. It REALLY damages your hair and is not worth your money since your'e going to end up buying at least three every year. I have bought this straightener four times already and never will again. Yeah, it may straigten your hair..but it will make it look dry and frizzy. It doesn't make it look shiny, and there are certainly better ones on the market that are healthier for your hair."
0,Great actors in a not-so-great movie,"Please bring back the old Friedkin!! i.e. the Exorcist, the French connection. I agree with most of the previous negative reviews that have been posted here, especially the numerous plot holes. Friedkin loves to leave the audience guessing but here he just leaves us hanging. These types of movies are actually quite common on the Sc-fi channel, and this is exaclty where ""Bug"" belongs....not on the big screen."
0,Horrible sound for the price; bad interior design,"I am really not impressed with this product, esp. when you factor in the price. The sound is highly distorted at high volume and at regular volume, it sounds like my old transistor radio. I get better sound out of my [cheaper] speakers.As another reviewer mentioned, parts of the interior are exposed, which doesn't make much sense, and the batteries are very tricky to get in (and shouldn't battery insertion be a no-brainer??) The batteries are also very susceptible to being knocked around, they do not sit securely in their sockets.Overall, considering this system is 2 to 3 times what I would have paid for other speakers, I'm returning these."
0,Not usable with 4th Generation Nano Ipod,"I purchased this item not knowing that it was not compatible with the 4th Generation Ipod. The description was unclear, I hope no one else makes the same mistake I did. So unfortunately, I am stuck with it because it would cost me more than I paid for it to return it. So I am just going to throw it in the trash. Lesson learned."
1,No English subtitles for the ITFML Making of DVD!,"I'd give both films 5 stars, but I'd subtract one for this product. I'm a huge fan of Wong Kar-Wai's films, and when I went to Hong Kong last weekend I really sought this item out, having seen it on HMV's website. I was very pleased with the four ITMFL and the other four 2046 bookmarks that were included. My only disappointment with this product is that no English subtitles are available in the Making of ITMFL/Deleted scenes DVD, whereas in the 2046 Making of DVD, they were included. Nonetheless, I still think this is a worthy buy for any big fan of Wong Kar-Wai's films, though the ITMFL Criterion Collection version seems to offer better features."
0,Avoid like the plague,"I bought one of these for my daughter for $119. Total ripoff...it's unplayable. The pads don't seal and one of the keys closes when another one is pushed. The problem is that on a REAL flute, that isn't supposed to happen. It's pretty and shiny, but sounds dreadful. She had to use it at band camp for a couple of days while waiting for her Gemeinhardt to come in the mail and was so frustrated that she nearly quit band. I wish that I had read some reviews before I bought it because it was a complete waste of money."
1,Great for the Mature Audience,"As a 50-something woman in the workforce, I want to keep up with the styles while not looking silly. This is the book to guide you. (Keep the basics simple and go for new accessories for the season)."
1,Fantastic recording of one of the best musicals in history!,"If you love The American Tribal Love-Rock Musical ""HAiR,"" then this cd is a must! It contains the original London cast recordings as well as some bonus tracks from the 1970 London release, ""Fresh Hair.""Take it from a former cast member, this is a keeper!"
0,Pay strict attention. Hard to relax and watch with so many twists.,"The movie has a plot but it makes a Robert Ludlum novel seem to be very simple. It is always testing you to see if you know where they are.Overall, enjoyable, but not one of LD's better movies."
1,Fantastic,"This is one of the funniest books I have ever read. It seems to appeal to men and women, young and old. Several friends have borrowed it and told me they've never laughed so hard. The bad thing is - THESE ARE REAL RECIPES! The commentary is excellent. Let us all be thankful that the days of ""something in aspic"" are (hopefully) gone forever."
0,TOTAL GARBAGE SOFTWARE!!! -5 stars from a EE,This is absolutely the worst POS software ever created. I tried this on 2 different state of the art computers and I still have yet to successfully create a simple audio CD. I honestly can't believe they have this on the market. By the way they give you 30 days free phone support if you call on your dime. I had to call them to get the software to install. The guy on the line tells me to just delete the problem file and it will work. I asked him if this started my 30 day free phone support.. he said yes... after that it would still not burn a cd. but makes a lot of frisbys... I put it on another older pent III 800 MHZ machine.. same error message when installing .. but I knew which file to delete to get it installed... still it would hang up for 10 min at a time... just unbelievable... DONT TOUCH THIS it is total GARBAGE!!!!! btw im an electrical engineer computer expert.
1,It was worth it.,"I received two packages of thai basil, tightly sealed with the air removed. There was a lot of product in each package (see photos). The basil was green and fresh. It did seem to take awhile to get the shipment, but I didn't keep track of how long, just seemed longer than I normally wait. I paid $14 + shipping and that is totally worth it for me, as I made about 20 servings. Much cheaper than buying thai dishes at restaurant!"
0,bad news,"For those who lament its permanent removal from the market, Citrucel company has a nice little eulogy and apology written up, reasuring that it was perfectly safe, just didn't sell well. If that doesn't make you feel better about beloved fibershake, note that They did not happen to mention the recall of over 4 million packets of it from 2006 -2008 due to excessive numbers of coliforms! Yuck! Recalls are on recalls.gov or FDA site"
1,"Darkest, Dankest, Def-est hip hop cut","Been listening to this album for 4 or 5 years now - still nothing beats it - so dark, deep, complex...Light years ahead of its time, and probably never to be beat. El-P needs Vast Aire, and Vast Aire needs El-P - nothing either of them have done solo or with others can touch this lucky coincidence of artists coming together at just the right moment, and conceiving something that has no equal or replacement."
1,Great Fun,"My sister and I both loved these books... they are funny and sad and everything in between... I was hooked from the beginning, couldn't put them down..."
1,Another Collector!,"love the movies and the show and i'm just grateful that at least 8 episodes were released on DVD. 4 on each DVD isn't bad, especially for the time. it'll just feel like watching a full movie, in a way.i say any ""All Dogs Go To Heaven"" fan should own this DVD and add it to your collection!these were the good ol' days!"
1,Great read,"I had seen and heard a lot about this book, but never took the time to read it until it was given to me by a friend a few weeks ago. I finished it a couple days ago and was really impressed-Miller took on a lot of difficult subjects-guilt, love, church life- and used his own experiences to make them relate to the average person. Not a very difficult read, but it definitely will get you thinking."
1,This game is exploding with action!,This game is so cool. Learning different spells is fun too. The Quidditch match against Slytherin is one of the coolest parts of the game.I thought the troll was thrilling.
0,Hated,Horrid. Sent back. Made in v was mentioned in reviews as too small. Sure enough. Sad though. I've always liked these.
0,Violent and Disturbing,This was a very strange movie with violence aimed at and from children. This seems most inappropriate considering the horror that this represents when it's actually played out. I like dystopic and sci fi movies but even there I think there should be some boundaries which this movie grossly overstepped.
0,Dead of winter,Plot sort of over the top and unsatisfying. Lots of typos in this edition. Will read another before a final decision on writers.
0,my vacuum ate its own cord,"If you are looking for a quality vacuum cleaner that will last you longer than year or if you plan to use your vacuum on a weekly basis, I'd suggest investing in a better vacuum cleaner than this model. Here are three things I noticed upon using the vacuum cleaner within the first use: it blows dust everywhere as I am vacuuming and so I'm chasing after the dust particles; the cord is long and awkward and the vacuum cleaner ate the cord and stripped the rubber covering off of it (i taped it with duck tape); finally cleaning out the bagless filter can be messy and I'd recommend wearing something to cover your face. Vacuum cleaners should make your cleaning easy not more work!"
0,I don't get it.,A....to tell you the truth...I don't get it. The singer sounds like he is nuts...or going crazy. A little like a chicken being choked. Is this really a high rated CD? You have got to be kidding!
0,Not the Typical Tale,"The illustrations for the version of Jack and the Beanstalk are wonderful, however, the text is from a 1807 version and is difficult to read easily. This is compounded by the fact that it is in rhyme so some of the words/grammer are really strange to keep the rhyme pattern."
1,"Great Shape, Great Service","This book came in great shape, looking just like new. It also was shipped and received in a timely manner."
1,Can't find locally.,"I use this tape for my work and have been satisfied with the product as a whole, but I have noticed over the years a decline in the quality of the tape material itself. Thickness of the tape and shorter life span have been a disappointment. Only way to break this item is to have the end pop off, and I have been noticing a disturbing trend for this to happen much sooner for the newer tapes than the older ones that I used in the past. With no local distributors I some times have to fight off clients that see the tape and want one. A little less emphasis on the case ( had one old lady drive over it and it still works) and a little more emphasis on the tape strength would be appreciated.Thanks"
0,"All fluff, no substance","This tiny book is not a worthwhile entertaining reference, and is overpriced for what it is. It has a weird tone and isn't funny when attempting to be. For some great entertaining books, see Barefoot Contessa."
0,Usual Italian-inspired crud,"Best watched while drunk, I'm guessing.Directing: Not the least bit scary. No development, no thrill, no sense of timing. It's just gore, violence, rape, violence, chase scene, violence.--- Pretty framing, but bad storytelling.Writing: Dialogue is largely noise. The characters have a cumulative IQ of around 85. The dog ""Beast"" is actually the smartest."
0,You call this a book,"I can not beleive that someone would even publish this sort of trash. I really hope that the author did NOT expect to get rich with this sort of filth. I am a PROUD african American Woman, and this book made me feel ashamed of my heritage. We no longer live in the early 1900's the world has evolved, it's time that these close minded southerners realize that they are not from this country either!!!I am guessing that the two good reviews that this book got were from family members, if so what a shame, but I see why, family is probably the only people that read this book. Save your money!!!"
0,Penny Serenade-,"I was very disappointed in the product. The dvd case was so poorly designed that the dvd could not be held on its spindle and arrived badly scratched. The ""remastered"" copy appears to be a cheap bootleg with cheap paperwork copy, cheap holding case and cheap copying. Not a great copy. Yes, better than some of the others that are available. [...]"
0,Poorly Written,"This is the worst book I have ever read. The writing is so poor it makes me think that the book was written by a high-shcool student in need of some writing classes. The message of being a so-called lovecat is so far from the truth in today's tough business climate that it is hard to imagine this book being nothing more than a throw back to the good old days of the Internet era. Finally, being nice to people instead of nasty is common advice that should find its way not in a book that you have to pay for, but among friends and family that are free and more credible."
0,The best scene was edited!!!!,"I saw this movie on television back in the day and enjoyed it. I found a VHS tape in K-mart 20 years ago and my kids enjoyed it growing up. I lost track of that video, so ordered this one recently. The quality is acceptable, but the best scene of the movie is missing!!!! At the very end, Joan van Arc says, ""It the last dinosaur, the last one"", and Richard Boone says, ""So am I"" - that scene is completely missing from this version of the movie. What a let-down!"
1,Great Device- Buy it.,"I bought this device for my Dell' Desktop computer. I did not have a problem installing the software or the device. I followed the instructions very carefully as I knew, from the posted reviews, that people were having trouble installing it.Overall, the picture is better with DVD inputs, but an analog cable signal displays fine. Further, the sound is great. If you are looking for a high definition picture from this device, you WILL be disappointed.The device does use a lot of the CPU power. At some points, the device used up 40% of the CPU power.Balancing the pros and the cons, I am recommending this device to my friends and family."
1,Perfect for traveling,"It comes in a resealable plastic. It is about men's size 8, but the open toe accommodates a range of sizes. Cheap enough to dispose after a week's hotel stay, or sturdy enough to use for months."
1,awesome guide while watching,this book is neat to have handy while watching any episode of the star trek series.how neat it is to look up a map location of the particular episode youre viewing..4 stars
0,It looks good,"It looks good in the store and out of the box but after I hooked it up and starting playing movies it would skip not on everything just certain movies and Tv shows it s a wierd skip ownly happening during scene changes it would leave a ""ghost"" of the previous scene in the new scene very briefly.I took it back to the store figuring it was just this unit but the next one did the same thing.I cannot recommend this product!"
0,Not Recommended,"I think the author has talent, and I hope will one day write an interesting story really well. But this one isn't - even with dragons and sexuality and so on, it's boring. I would try another book of hers, outside this trilogy."
0,Wow! This is bad!,"Ok... I love pop. Good voices like Janet Jackson, Christina, and Kelly Clarkson all define the genre. This CD is so bad I felt like I was listening to a 5 year old singing nursury rhymes. That is how bad her lyrics sounded. Hilary Duff has her own TV show (just as bad as her CD by the way) and then all of a sudden she has talent and gets a record deal. What is going on? She is not pretty at all. Her voice sounds like it was fed through a machine. Wake up America!! If you want to hear real talent go buy ""Stripped"" (Christina) or ""Thankful"" by Kelly Clarkson"
1,Fabulous Fun Toy,"My 7 month old grand daughter's favorite toy. She loves chewing on the rings, banging them anywhere, and watching the lights. The songs are just awesome and very entertaining. Very durable construction. An excellent update of an old favorite."
0,Good games -- if you can play them,"This product has some worthwhile educational games. But they must be launched from the disk. Some of the games launch, while others do not (I have a machine running Vista running program compatibility with Win95). Many of these titles are shareware/freeware types, so have even more limited playability."
1,An old friend,"I remember this was the first volume of Dover piano music I ever bought, back when I was in high school in 1970 when it was first published. Then it cost exactly four dollars. I have played from it in all the years since then. The front cover long ago disappeared, but true to Dover's standards of sewing the pages in with thread like the best books, the volume is still intact.This is an generous collection of Debussy's earlier piano music, all from the original editions. A warning however, the original editions come with the original misprints, but most of these are obvious to the eye and ear."
1,Great Movie,"This is, without doubt, one of the funniest movies the late, great John Candy ever made. Richard Crenna is great as the rich, snobby dentist who thinks he owns Florida and tries to run Candy's family out by refusing their rent check (he owns thier rental house). Great performances by Candy, Crenna, and Rip Torn. I have only one problem with the movie....there is a great song by Jimmy Buffett called ""Turning Around"" which is featured in full as the credits roll, but the song is not available. I am a Buffett fan, but I have never seen the song in any recorded form, and there seems to be no ""Summer Rental"" soundtrack. It's frustrating to watch the movie, hear the song, and not be able to buy the song anywhere. Why Buffett never released it is beyond me. Anyway, the movie is great, the acting is wonderful, and the soundtrack is really good.Watch ""Summer Rental"" and be prepared to laugh."
0,A Great Way to Get Unexcited About Your Trip to Japan,"This Lonely Planet Guide is another copy of all the previous Japan guides with all the same disappointments.Coverage of areas outside of Tokyo and Kyoto is honestly rather shoddy, and they've kept the obnoxious negativity that makes an exciting trip to Japan seem like a waste of time. While other Lonely Planet guides are lively, with authors that seem to enjoy the travelling, Lonely Planet Japan's authors write as though they really don't like Japan. It is questionable whether or not the writers even visited the cities they are reviewing.This guide is probably most useful as a reference of places to look up on your own in another source."
0,Worst spoon ever,Melts like an ice as soon as it gets near the burner. Won't last more two days even. Worst buy ever.
1,Find out what homelessness is really about.,"I Have Arrived Before My Words by Deborah Pugh and Jeanie Tietjen are autobiographical writings of five homeless women. These five homeless women talk about their experiences through life being homeless. If you are curious and want to find out more about homelessness, this is the book for you. After reading I Have Arrived Before My Words, I see homelessness in a different way. I never would have thought that being homeless would be so difficult."
0,Really pretty awful tasting,I bought this based on the other reviews and am incredibly disappointed. It is basically tasteless! I usually make my own bread from scratch (both white and wheat) and hoped to be able to just throw this in my bread maker when I'm in a hurry. We threw it out!
1,An accomplished novel!!,Waters is able to create a strange moody literary landscape--one that would never be in a bestseller. For me this is refreshing and interesting. Waters crafted the beginning and middle of the novel very painstakingly--I appreciated the craft but at times I wanted a little more variation in pace. She actually takes you into the musty constrained world of a slightly hysterical spinster--and makes it interesting because she unearths the passion underneath the surface.The ending felt a little rushed--but this might be because it was jarring and sudden for the protagonist and Waters brought me into her world.All in all a worthwhile read that takes you to another time and place!!
0,No Heat,"I bought this pad for my dog to warm up on cold days. When I couldn't feel any heat coming off it outside, I brought it inside, plugged it in. It says it will heat up to 100 degrees. Well, after 2 hours, it wouldn't even warm up to register on a thermometer, so it must have been less than 80 degrees."
0,junk,"it looks very nice! but it jams up,pennys drop into quarter slots,dimes go into nickel slots,pennys always jamming up.i messed with this machine for a couple hrs...even went slow and everytime it would jam up or drop change in wrong slots! I can do it faster by hand. i am returning it as its junk."
1,Great product .......but,"I have had the camera for 6 weeks and have taken several hundred photos, mainly of the America's Cup qualifying races in Auckland.One reviewer complained that the power button and shutter are easy to confuse. I fully agree, and have lost a couple of action shots through the confusion. My biggest problem is with the physical strength of the camera. I was taking pictures from a boat, and the lens gently nudged a bulkhead. This was a gentle nudge, but enough to dislodge the lens, which fell off completely when I shut the power down. The Fuji distributor in Auckland was fantastic, and repaired the camera promptly, and without charge. It was not the first time they had seen the problem, so be warned! I have a 64meg card, and this is more than enough."
1,"Quick ship, good product","Good product. Purchased the same once before so I knew what I was getting. If I can get something that works for me and pay half the cost of a famous name brand, I'll certainly do it. Was shipped quickly as usual. What more can be said about this product, ahhh, not too much. Thanks amazon.com ."
0,they're paperweights,"i received the controllers in good time which made me happy ... until i opened them package up . the first controller i tried didnt work at all , i think the receiver was the problem , but either way after many attempts i decided that it just wasnt going to happen , and went to the next one . the next one at least received a signal , which made me happy .... til i saw that the left stick was broken and leaning to the left , rendering it worthless as well. they look cool when they light up , but thats about all that worked on em . they're garbage."
0,The real reason,Women have always withheld sex and used it as a weapon to get what they want. The real reason women initiate 91% of divorces is because they get everything they did not earn! DUh.
1,works fine!,"A nice little hook with a rubber coating. Does the job and seems sturdy. As one reviewer noted, I wish the peg-board wire was thicker....drills can get heavy!! I think I am going to buy another one of these as well...."
1,4.5 Stars for a Grand Read,"I picked ""The Grand Sophy"" as my introduction to GH, and it's a WOW! Such a satisfying read, chock full of memorable characters, humour and a great detailed glimpse into the society, fashions and speech of the Regency period. I understand the author was the undisputed expert of this era and it really shows.Sophy is such a likeable manipulator, especially when scheming against her adversary, Charles Rivenhall. Many laughs at the predicaments and unexpected outcomes she finds herself in.Excellent detail on the carriages, horses and especially the manners of that time. I feel like I was whisked away in a time machine and stole a little glimpse into the chaos that follows The Grand Sophy. It was truly a delightful journey and am looking forward to delving into the other works by this incredible author."
1,wireless n?,"Don't think this one qualifies as true wireless N, perhaps early generation stuff. 100 mbs tops with d link wireless N extreme everything. I enjoy 300 mbs min from everything else I have that is wireless. this card is faster than the standard wireless G stuff, instals very nicely real easy to load any drivers for it, Has very little system requirements you really can't tell its there. The card has low packet failure rates works very well. The only complaint I have is it is a little slow on the transfer speed side compared to the recent wireless N stuff."
1,Real Football,An unashamed look at the NFL in the 70s. This was a fun time! When men were men and football was football.
1,Ultralast UL9613MK Battery,"The price was right and I wasn't expecting anything special. I was surprised. It is, externally, identical to the OEM battery except for the label. It appears that the same molds and even identical plastics were used to produce it. It checked out up to spec on my multi-meter, and has operated for more than a month now under fairly heavy use.Absolutely no complaints from me. A very good battery for a fair price."
1,A very good introduction or refresher book,"This book is written like a college textbook. The same style with exercises and questions in the back of each chapter. I liked it, since there are lots of examples to walk you through the different parts of the language."
1,One of the most interesting stories I've ever read!,"I read many of the anthropological books on the ""Yanoama"" (uncommon spelling used in book) first but I learned more from this book than all the rest put together. She just tells her story, in great detail, and all the emotion and humanity comes out in the story. The people come across as individual people, not a monolithic species to be observed and catalogued in an anthropological zoo.It takes some time to get through and I never did keep track of which tribe was which and who's trying to kill whom, but you really feel for her and she really brings you into her world. Why this isn't #1 on the Yanamami reading list, or Amazon tribe reading list for that matter, is beyond me. It's maybe the most fascinating biography I've ever read."
0,"Tainted Love Becomes More Tainted, Musically","Club 69 has earned the reputation of making horrible remixes. Let's start with Yaz's ""Don't Go"" and ""Situation"". The remixes for these classic songs were worthless and unnecessary. The same thing has occurred with Soft Cell's ""Tainted Love."" Not only are the beats monotonous, but become boring and tiresome to the ears. I must admit, as a DJ, I like to make mix tapes where two songs mix nicely with similar beats. I was able to mix a remix included in this CD with Depeche Mode's ""Personal Jesus"", as they both sound alike due to the drum background. For this, I give this production one star. Maybe If I had the remix equipment, I could've have done a better job. But for now, for get anything remixed by Club 69. By listening to it, you'll be wasting away your haircells that can be used to hear something more delightful, such as the original release."
1,Thank You,"This book was quite an interesting read. It kept me interested from start to finish. I heard the movie was excellent, but I wanted to read the book first."
0,Avoid at all costs!!,"Avoid this DVD! This concert DVD is nothing more than a very poor copy of Donna's ""VH1 Live & More Encore"" DVD. The picture and sound are very low quality. The picture is dark and blurry and the audio sounds muffeled. Also, the order of the songs has been changed, which now leaves Donna's costume changes making no sense what so ever, since outfits now disappear and reappear through out the show. Tina Arena also now appears and disappears without any intro from Donna telling us who she is and why she's there. I have no idea why somebody thought is was a good idea to release this DVD, except maybe to deceive Donna's fans into thinking they were getting something they weren't! Take my advice and don't make the same mistake I did! Stay away from this DVD! If you haven't already buy Donna's DVD ""VH1 Live & More Encore"" you'll be glad you did.Donna"
0,Very disappointing,A few laughs but not worth the money. Wish I'd gone to the Library first to read it.
1,Incredible Read,"Like many, I was only introduced to this wonderful book (and the rest of the ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" series) from the also superb HBO TV series. I started reading the book a couple weeks before the TV show began, and I am completely hooked on the novels. Game of Thrones is nothing short of a sublime read that is intricate, intelligent, and epic all in one. I thought I had given up reading fantasy novels years ago, but now with this series, my interest has been completely renewed. There are so many well-developed and interesting characters here it is near impossible to choose a favorite, but needless to say ""The Imp"" is definitely one of mine!"
1,A Better Tape!,"Purchased both front and rear louver sets. Rear set went on with no problems. The fronts were another story! The louver pieces resisted the contour of the fender. Went to the autoparts store and purchased 3m trim and decal adhesive. Apply a thin coat of the adhesive to the two-way tape on the louver, hold in place for 5to10mins and you will be good! They look super and give the fenders a nice highlight! Would recomend Karyakan use a little more bend at the factory and a better quality tape."
1,"Excellent movie, everything everyone said before is correct yet","You can watch this movie in the dark because we find out that zombies are afraid of the dark. Take some time, watch the movie. You will find yourself totally engrossed in the film and come back wanting more redneck goodness."
0,Annoying Voice,"I could not get past the voice to enjoy the CD. Too fast? Loud? Tone? I have a collection of meditation cd's, self-help, etc, and this one is just not easy to listen to and absorb."
0,too much cheese,"Actually make it 2 1/2 stars, halfway seems pretty fair.this years is ok, better than last years but still not a classic.So many cheesy tracks(lollipop, be cool, unbreak my heart), about 10 or more songs that are remakesjust kinda turned me off.My favourite tracks were: beatbox 130, did i dream (song to the siren), out of the city and emerge, about half of the rest were pretty good but no tracks that i really loved. I don't know if it's just me but this one seemed more cheesy than ever before, it even has the ketchup song! bah buuut it's ok really."
1,Best Metallica album in years,"In their best album since Master of Puppets, Metallica really delivers on Garage, Inc. In a world where musicians take themselves far too seriously, this album nicely balances power and eighties kitsch. The choice of songs to cover comes from a wide range of bands, and many of these remakes are better than the originals. Highly recommended."
0,????,"I thought this book was gonna be about the BasedGod. It was aight, but not what I expected. Please don't name a book after Lil B the Based God if it's not about him in the future. Thank you."
1,Jingle all the way,"I only gave this 4 stars because while it looks very good, it remains to be seen how it will hold up. That being said, Emma (dobie) got very excited when tried this on her, she likes to get new stuff and she certainly seemed to like this! Too bad I didn't film it and I could have posted a video of her prancing around the house, it was pretty funny! I purchased this after xmas when I saw how bad a shape Emma's xmas collar at the time was getting so she will not actually wear it until the 2012 season. Guess we'll have to wait till then to see how well it holds up."
0,What was her Editor thinking?,"Or does she not have one any longer? What happened to theCornwell of Body of Evidence, Postmortem and (my favorite) All ThatRemains? I stopped reading the Cause of Death around page 200. I just could not put myself through any more torture of unlikeable characters (not one likeable character!) and tedious writing style. If I were Putnam I'd be ashamed to admit how many zeros were on Ms. Cornwell's check for this book! I won't read another."
1,Love this boppy!,Perfect for our twin granddaughters. Wish we had this when my kids were little! A must have for new Moms!!!!
0,Unbelievably boring,Who cares about Larry Flunt? He's some redneck who tried to make a splash with a dirty pictures magazine. Big deal. That was two boring hours of my life I'll never get back....
1,Charming family film,"I didn't really know what to expect from this movie since I don't think it played very many movie theaters in this country, but what an amazing surprise this turned out to be! Delightful as well as insightful. Beautiful cinematography showing the glorious South African landscapes, and of course, Duma the cheeta is mezmerizing as he journeys with his two companions back to his home. I recommend this wonderful little film to families and to anyone who just wants to watch a movie that makes you feel so good!"
0,Lost my new cellphone,"This product is connected to the clip via a screw on the back. If your screw comes loose like mine did, you'll lose your cellphone too. Then you'll be screwed as I was."
0,Poor quality product,"I really wanted to like this unit. The graphics were nice, features were nice, my family had a lot of fun with it at first. Then the memory went out on it and I called Magellan (long wait time) and they said to send it in. After 2 months I got it back and it didn't work at all right out of the box, then I noticed it wasn't even my unit, they had exchange it for a different one that didn't work! Of course I had to send it in (again at my cost) and after another 6 weeks wait they send me back the second unit in working condition - well it worked for about a month, which, for me included using it about three times. No, I didn't mishandle any of these units. I am very disappointed with it."
1,Guidance for fulfillment of mans need to get laid.,"The Game is about how to get laid. It is not about how to grow and develope a meaningful and lasting relationship. For most young healthy and inexperienced men it is the perfect book to help them overcome and grow out of their shyness, fear, and confusion in dealing with women. And that is what young men need most. Women can be difficult for men from all ages and walks of life, one wrong woman can easily ruin a mans life if he is not very careful. This book tells you how to take charge of your life men, read it before you even think of saying hello to another female. The stuff they teach in school is crap, this is about what it is really about in dealing with the most dangerous creature to ever walk the planet, the human female!!!! Carlos Caliente the worlds hottest magician and Latin Lover recommended this book to me and I will eternally be grateful. I owe you big time Caliente! .... Bill Perron"
0,Brian has created better products than this. NOT RECOMENDED,"I am a big fan of Brian Tracy. Our company sells all his tape'sand video products. This one is an absolute no no. You would be betterbuying, Getting Rich in America, or Brian Tracy's Success Mastery Academy, if you want real information. This is a glossed product, with very little content.You will learn more content from Larry Winget's book, Money is Easy, Think & Grow Rich Napoleon Hill, The Science of Getting Rich by Wallace D Wattles or Born Rich by Bob Proctor. The only people who will become millionaires from this abissmal product are the publishers and Brian Tracy.I WARN YOU IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY!"
1,Wow,"Haven't heard of Madeleine Peyroux before I purchased this item. Listening to it, made me float away from day to day issues right away. Ideal for Sunday morning or hot Summer evenings. Do not use it while driving. You may doze away."
0,Whoa!,I say $5.95 to ship a $10 item is a bit steep for my wallet. I'd suggest Amazon carry this item themselves so that buyers don't get ripped off by this kind of thing.
0,Great To Look At,"Looked great on the counter. Continually vibrated around when in use. Difficult to remove lid, too shallow. After a couple years of occasionally making smoothies, the rubber axle sheered off with the blade. Waste of my hard earned money. Not made of the same quality as Gramma's, she used hers for a couple decades, and made strawberry smoothies all the time."
1,GREAT CD FROM A GREAT SHOW!,I LOVED THIS CD! IF YOU LOVE TO DANCE AND HAVE A NONSTOP CD THEN YOU WILL FLIP FOR THIS CD. EVERY SONG (INCLUDING THE YOKO ONO SONG) IS WORTH THE MONEY! DONT LET ANYONE TELL YOU DIFFERENT GET THE CD AND WATCH THE SHOW YOU WILL REALLY ENJOY EVERY MINUTE OF IT. A DEFINATE MUST HAVE ... ALSO GET SEASONS ONE AND TWO ON CD. THEY ARE WORTH BUYING AS WELL. LOVE YOU MARQ!
1,Awesome rap/rock combo,"I don't know how, but everlast manages to pull off the rap/rock combo like nobody else. Alot of tracks, some great guitar work, and incredible song writing make this album a winner. I would even recommend it to people who do not like rap music so much; trust me, you will like this album"
1,Into a New Neighborhood,"A deeply satisfying, rich offering from Ian McCulloch and company. McCulloch seems to have found some resolution since the fevered days of ""Thorn of Crowns"" and ""Over the Wall."" Ironically, my investment in the Bunnymen always had as much to do with Will Sargeant's swirling, swizzle-stick guitar as it did with McCulloch's brandy-rich vocals. On ""What Are You Going to Do"" Sargeant's chopping guitar has mellowed considerably; at first listen, his fingerprints seem missing here. However, like the album as a whole, after some careful forensics, you discover that both he and McCulloch are alive and well, having merely moved to a quieter neighborhood."
0,Not very good for laptops,"I bought this look in the hope that it would help me secure my TOSHIBA laptop. It didn't. Even with the wrong combination, when you press the release button the locking pin retracts ever so slightly, making it possible to remove the lock from the Kensignton slot. I'll have to buy a good Kensington T-bar lock to replace it.It does seem to work properly with the slot in the other end of the chain and the steel cable seems to be good. So I wouldn't advertise it as suitable for PCs, but if you have something else you need to chain down, this should help."
0,Very poor quality toy that is largely unusable,"We just purchased this toy today and were very disappointed. Although it looks cute from the packaging, it is actually extremely flimsy. The swing that comes with the set is unusable; when you try to swing it back and forth, it knocks over the entire set-up. As for the teeter-tauter, you can put the kitty and the puppy in it, but you can't make it go up and down without the animals falling out! Total waste of money. DO NOT BUY IT - EVEN ON SALE!"
0,Just a little politically incorrect.......,"After a smash hit with Curious George goes to the Hospital, we decided to get this for my 3.5 year old. We were shocked! George is abducted by the man with the yellow hat (is actually shown shackled in a bag), nearly drowns while falling off the ship catching seaguls (is shown gasping for air underwater), then is confronted by very angry firefighters after experimentally making a phone call that results in a false alarm. The final shocker is George being thrown in jail and desparately trying to get out which finally results in his crying. This was little too much for our 3.5 year old.Buyer beware!!!!!"
0,BOOO! Save yourself the irritation!,"1--the exhaust is on the front of the vacuum, which blows the dirt around before you can even get to it to vacuum it up! This is especially irritating on hard floor surfaces, and even worse when you have pet hair!2--the unit is falling apart at the seams.3--the button to release the dirt canister fell off, and you can't get a replacement.4--the handle is not strong enough to push the vacuum across carpet; it buckles and snaps off.5--when I called the Shark Corporation to request a repair, I had to ship it back (this is fine) but also send them $30 to repair... although they claim to have a Full Warranty! I decided to just buy a different vac.One good point, is that the motor/suction is strong, but when the body is breaking off, what good is that!?"
0,I should have listened and ordered from England,"A fine performance from von Sydow, some dazzling setups by Argento, great music by Goblin, all to no effect because Artisan has chosen not to take original composition ratio seriously. A lousy pan-and-scan. Great movie, lousy edition. A waste of my money. Better than nothing? Maybe that's what the second star is for."
0,Pricey treatment for dry skin. Had little effect on my twin girls' KP.,"I have purchased two large tubes of KP Duty lotion and one large container of scrub. I've used the products as suggested on my toddler girls for over 6 months. Sadly, we did not experience any improvements. The bumps on their arms, thighs and buttocks became inflamed and red after using the scrub and I did not notice a reduction in the bumpy patches. I did however, get soft hands from applying the products to my girls.We visited the dermatologist last week. He was unfamiliar with this product, but prescribed a compound of 1% hydrocortisone in an acid mantel base with 10% urea. We've used this compound for only a week and we're already seeing a great reduction in bumps.I would suggest not paying the ridiculous price for this product. The marketing is way better than the product."
1,Food for the Ears,I thought this CD was their best. My favorite song on the disk was Jaded with Benji from Good Charlotte. It's a great cd for any occasion.
1,"Bright, good beam pattern","I've researched headlight bulbs on car enthusiast forums, and this is one of the bulbs they recommended. I'm happy with them."
1,"Concise, inexpensive, and comprehensive!","This truly may be The Only Grammar Book You'll Ever Need. I am a tutor and have found this book indispensable; it's especially useful when coaching students for the SAT-II Writing exam and the English section of the ACT. Any grammar question you can possibly have seems to be in here, and it's very easy to reference. I can't imagine being without this book."
1,"Beautiful, Delicious, Simple, and Elegant","I am lucky enough to live in the San Francisco Bay Area, where ""shojin"" cuisine (Japanese Buddhist temple cuisine) is served to two wonderful restaurants: Cha Ya and Medicine. I often say ""I could live on that cuisine,"" so when I discovered Fujii's cookbook, I was thrilled. The recipes are so simple but divinely delicious - and of course healthful! Many of the recipes call for only 5 or 7 ingredients, some of which may be unfamiliar at first. But, after your first visit to an Asian grocery or even the Asian aisle of your supermarket, you'll be ready to master this cuisine. As a vegan cooking instructor and a lover of this simple but elegant cuisine, I have prepared many of the dishes in this book and recommend each one as highly as the next. The simplicity is amazing, and the flavors are divine. You'll love this book!"
0,Not so great.....,"This product is good, but has some issues with staying stuck to the windshield. If I had to purchase again, I would get one that had 3 suction cups and not only 2. It keeps falling off and hitting the floor. So I just keep it in the glove box. Just FYI. Get one with 3 or 4 suction cups."
0,What!,"I bought this cd because it was on sale. I did not even realize he had a new cd out. I like R Kelly and all his previous music, but I did not like this double cd set. The first cd ""Happy People"" was ok lots of stepping beats and so on. All the tracks sound the same to me, the best track is the last one ""Happy People"" The second cd was gospel, I did not like it at all It was a big disappointment. Maybe he should have sung some upbeat tunes instead of all slow ones. No one should judge this man by whats going on in his personal life, he is still very talented but this is not his best work to date."
0,Complete Piece of Crap,"Based on our satisfaction with our Dyson upright we bought this handheld unit a year ago. 12 months later after very little use, the battery - which sucks to begin with (6 minute run time)now only runs for 60 seconds if we are lucky. Product is a complete rip off and a stain on Dyson's reputation. They should be ashamed of themselves for releasing something like this and charging $150 for it is the ultimate insult. You are essentially making a $150 donation to Dyson for a useless paperweight. Would not buy another one at any price. It has no electric option so it is dead weight when the battery stops and it will stop before you can even think about getting anything done with it."
1,Even better live,"One of my favorite bands...and they sound even better live! You can hear the same songs on other albums, but it isn't the same."
0,Disappointment,"Although I've been a big fan of the Acid Jazz/Neo-Soul, I just recently had the pleasure of recognizing Kelli Sae as a great voice within the genre while listening to Incognito's Who Needs Love CD. I quickly became enamored with Kelli's vocals on Stone Cold Heart, so naturally I did an online search of Kelli's work, and found out about this cd. I purchased it the next day and even though I'm not a musician I could tell that this body of work was an overall poor production for such a great talent. There were only two songs that captured the quintessential elements of Kelli's talent (the very danceable ""Can't Wait"" and the very reflective ""Heaven""). Other than that the arrangements were amature when compared to Kelli's efforts on the Incognito CD I previously mentioned. As I said Ms. Sae has a tremendous voice and I wouldn't hesitate to purchase another one of her CDs, but do yourself a favor and save your money on this compact disk."
1,"shaken, not stirred","This set was perfect for a vodka comparison testing I hosted. The shaker top screws onto the glass base so there is no worry about it coming apart while shaking. It is glass so there is nothing but the ice cold taste of what you are shaking that comes through. The glasses were elegant enough and the perfect size for a tasting or for doing shots. The shaker is also great for making a couple of martinis at a time or any other shaken, not stirred drink. Overall, a great product for my needs."
0,This book is despicable,"Only an idiot or a criminal would follow the advice this author gives. His suggestions range from violations of employees' privacy (listening in on their private conversations, searching their personal possessions) to major safety issues (keeping the back door deadbolted so no one can get out). As someone who has been both an employer and an employee, I'm shocked and appalled at his complete lack of consideration for other people.I don't see how any person with a shred of intelligence or self esteem could stand working for an employer like this. I wonder how he finds time to work on implementing a strategic plan for the business when he spends all day snooping on his employees and micromanaging the cash register.And in case the author ever has a chance to read this review, here are a couple more clues to the mysteries of life:1. Your female employees are women, not girls.2. Winning the Superbowl is not the greatest possible success in the world."
1,kENZIE cUTIE,"This doll is so cute, and I love her puppy.The stylin' shades that come with the doll are also a major plus.Her ultimate carrot-top afro. puff just adds to her coolness quotient.She's much cooler than the other Mystery Squad Barbies.I love this doll."
1,I love this book.,"I realize that I am in limited company in loving this book. It is very strange and mixes (intentionally) poorly written pornography with rambling discussions of avant-garde literature, descriptions of the Scottish countryside, and ventriloquist's dummy who can think. There is sex and books and then more sex and more books. The plot is hilarious: a book within the book by a man who drags Princess Diana's corpse to ancient stone circles, a pair who drag a weighted ventriloquist's dummy to said circles to test the validity of said book.I write this positive review knowing that almost every reader will dislike this book. I eagerly await the day I meet someone else who loved it."
1,Miracles do happen,This is a great series. Even my children were pulled in by the incredible miracles and stories of jewish survivors. I highly endorse this series for anyone who wants to be reminded that God does do miracles.
0,So so,"This set has some real gems on it. But in all honesty, the gems are few and far between. One disc is ""the Doors favorites"" that have songs that are on their other albums. And if you are the type to be buying a box set, you probably have those other albums, so don't need duplicate copies of those songs. There is one disc that is of the Doors live, and it's nothing that great. The gems include songs off their first demo tape (where, oddly, they sound kind of like the VELVET UNDERGROUND), and a great jazz version of QUEEN OF THE HIGHWAY, which I LOVE. It's the best thing on the album. So if you are a real Doors fanatic, you'll appreciate the gems on this album. But for everyone else, this isn't worth it."
0,For those in search of meaning,"For those in search of meaning in their life, pass this book by unless you enjoy a light, not very well written, redundant, and not very insightfull book that relates everything that happens in life and stages of life to the levels of a house. The analogy gets old by the second chapter. The author's insights are limited and of common knowledge to those who have been questing for meaning for 6 months or more. Pass on this book and look for a more meaningful book that does not try to fit everyone and everything into one of her house's floors. Life must be dull for this author because she seems to see in black and white rather than the way I see life: an irradiant rainbow of changing and unpredictable color combinations. I did not even finish the book - I felt my time would be better spent doing the laundry and day dreaming."
1,"Feels fantastic in the hand and looks great!,","I purchased the hostess set, place settings for eight and four of the little spoons. I am extremely happy with my new silverware. I went to a department store and picked up/felt silverware from about fifty different styles/manufacturers before I settled on these. Then I came home and ordered what I wanted from Amazon for a much better deal. If you desire a modern design that feels solid and comfortable, I would highly recommend this silverware. I have had it for about two months and wash it in the dishwasher daily. It comes out looking beautiful every time! QUALITY!!!"
0,And the point is?,"I am currently on page 580 of this WOT book 10. I just read the following line:""And nothing at all had been decided except that more talk was necessary before anything could be decided.""That, in a nutshell, is exactly what this book is about thus far. Yawn."
0,lame,"Amber Frey is a money hungry, sad little person. It's really too bad that she felt the need to cash in on the tragedy of others. Luckily I was able to borrow this book so I didn't contribute to feeding her greed."
1,Excellent personal recipe journal,"I have really enjoyed my recipe journal. I needed a book to consolidate my most used recipes in because I tend to forget what the heck I cook. It has made it easy for me to flip thru MY favorite recipes and find a quick meal to make instead of going thru numerous cookbooks when time is of the essence. It's fun as well because instead of just writing the recipes down, I am making both color and black and white copies of recipes and taping them in the book along with pictures of what some of the recipes look like. I also have been able to write down recipes passed down to me by my mother that have no measurements, but I can cook them as long as I know the ingredients.It's a pretty book w/spiral binding and I am having a lot of fun with it. I hope to pass it down one day.If you need the tabs, indexes, sleeves, etc...not for you."
1,A must even for non-Elvis fans,"I bought this CD to brush up on my Elvis music prior to taking my Mom on a trip to Graceland in Memphis. I didn't consider myself to be an Elvis fan but when you listen to so many compelling tracks all crammed together on a single album, there really is no denying the genius that was Elvis."
0,The Ultimate Trivia Book?,"This trivia book has over 800 questions on Confederate generals. The problem is that numerous questions are re-used throughout the book. There is also a list of the generals in the back of the book that seems far from complete. It's good points is that it's unlike your regular trivia books due to focussing on a specific area of the war, with questions that will make you want to learn more about these men."
1,Good starting for project managers,"The book covers all aspects of the DWH from extraction to designing star scheme (could have more detailled example -> see ralph kimballs book) to data marting. Very useful for newcomers (like myself) to set up a project and know what to do and what not to do. Estimates are nice, but be careful about them..."
1,very quick delivery and unit works well,"The cisco-Linksys WRT54GL Wireless-G Broadband Router setup nicely using the enclosed setup disk, has added security over my old Linksys unit. Amazon delivered unit well on time.......Ken"
1,Great for camping,"I brought this camping and both guys and gals used this. It smells fresh, like you've taken a shower with regular shampoo, feels refreshing when going on. The directions say to soak your hair, massage it in and then towel dry. I have a lot of hair but still have a decent amount left (it was used by 5 adults). It does make your hair look smooth and it does make if feel like there's product in your hair (like gel) but it's much, much better than going without a shower."
0,Caveat Emptor,"Think twice before laying out $ for this clinker. It's a tape of two half hour 1962 ""Jazz USA"" shows, hosted by Oscar Brown, Jr. The photography is grotesque, the sound is bad (my copy had static as well), and the lighting is terrible. Sure, Frank Rosolino is a great musician; buy his CDs. As a pundit and singer, he's awful. And what a shame to be barely able to hear the great Stan Kenton mellophonium orchestra. As for Brown, well, he's best forgotten. A dud, folks."
1,Hill & Tolliver reunite,"I listened to this new release about a week after listening to Dance with Death...they are quite different. Time lines has a very Ornette-ish vibe to it, with little bop and lots of rubato balladry. Tolliver's tone has darkened over the years, and he really says something every time he gets the chance. I must disagree with the reviewer who claimed Tardy was phoning it in--I find his playing to be really excellent here...it's nice to hear the bass clarinet played well."
1,Beautifully illustrated,I love this book and so does my daughter. We read it over and over and I do not tire of looking at my favorite children's illustrators work.
0,"ok, but not good for cleavage","This strapless is a nice bra but I needed it for a bridesmaid dress and it flattened me out. It also is cut straight across the top so if you are wearing a shirt or dress with cleavage, you can see the bra."
0,Fairly obvious material with boring autobiography,"Maybe this was helpful 20 years ago, but as the author herself states in the foreward, masturbation is relatively accepted now. If you've masturbated before you probably don't need this. And if you hadn't you probably wouldn't want to read a book on it anyway. Author illustrates the book, and the pictures are pretty interesting. I swear that one of them is Lenin masturbating."
1,anything but cold,"Fridge is working the electro-acoustic angle, creating organic electronic music within a rock idiom (though fridge is far from strictly electronic). Fridge have crafted a sonic euphoria, accessible without narcotics. When I put this cd on for someone I already know that they will like it, so instead of telling them how great it is or trying to describe it, I ask them ""Do you want to hear some really weird music?"" If you already like Fridge, you should check out Tortoise, the Books, Boards of Canada, Mum, Seefeel, Fennesz and Hrvatski. (Hrvatski liked it so much that he reviewed it; see the featured review above.) All are doing a similar thing in different ways, that is giving Edward the hands he deserves."

0,Pointless waste of my time,"This book was not what I was looking for. I was looking for something a little more advanced than ""How To Write Demos in Cocoa"" (see ""Programming in Cocoa"" for an introduction to writing demos in Cocoa).I am very dissapointed, plus, the writing style was annoying."
1,Fine Western Storytelling by Country Singing Legend Willie Nelson,"I love Louis L'Amour westerns and I jumped at the chance to listen to several of his stories narrated by Willie Nelson and in two of them dramatized by others such as Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, and Kris Kristofferson. Willie Nelson has a nice storyteller's voice and pace.The stories are told in a variety of 3rd person and 1st person perspectives. They range from manhunts to range wars. The heroes are hard, upright men and the villains are greedy and conniving. I love the attention paid to historic detail- language, guns, landscape, clothing, and even thinking.The stories may be short, but there is not shallowness or rushed pace.It comes in a nice wooden collector's case.I recommend this collection to any Louis L'Amour or Western fan."
1,Econometrics and SAS were meant to be together,I thought that this manual really helped me in my job. It was a great aid to the knowledge that I already had about SAS and has been a wonderful resource for me.
0,Stolen work of Lars Von Trier,"Else then creating personalities to cover his complexes (first Bachman and now Eleanor), Mr King has now bacame a thief. Go wach the original Tv-series art by Lars Von Trier, The Kingdom. A 8 part post-modern TV series about unnatural events that take place in a hospital.There must be a border between the art of writing/literature and marketing tricks. And Mr.King has just crossed it.Stephen is now writing under the name Eleanor. After Richard he has developed another personality. Just a marketing trick. AND HE HAS STOLEN LARS VON TRIER's work, THE KINGDOM (or did he bought it?)anyway it is all a fraud. Shame on you mr king.You may trick the ""culture-free"" illiterate americans. But not everyone."
1,The Mystery of Mind Control,An excellent book that looks into the history and present controversy of mind control. A great book.
0,"Only syntax, use as a reference not as a first text on VHDL","This book can only be used as a reference. It describes the syntax of VHDL but does not really explain its semantics through examples. If you have never used VHDL, this book will not help you that much -- it is not met for a beginner."
0,Inconsistent consistency,"One tablet taste fine and is 'blended' well. The next one has chunks of the various ingredients in it and tastes awful. I usually have good luck with Solaray quality, but not this time. I took about 4-5 of them and threw the rest away."
0,Great Premise - Hellish Writing,"An adventure story about the discovery and exploration of Hell. What a wonderful idea. Unfortunately after a fairly promising first fifty or so pages, the book disintergrated into a boring, badly written, snore-fest that really faltered whenever it left its two main characters. Although it could have been a truely epic tale, as written this book was at least 150 pages too long. More time should have been spent on Homo hadalis and the other neat (but underwritten) subterranean creatures and less time on all the pseudoreligeous garbage. I found many of the characters to be poorly defined, and confusingly similar."
1,Mad Monster Party,"I really enjoyed the fact that I was able to share a memorable movie with my kids, as my own mother had shared this classic movie favorite with my sister and myself. Great Condition and addition to any movie collection also arrived right on time as promised Thanks again."
0,"This one should have been called ""POP""","I guess U2 can get away with throwing together and sewing up songs like ""Walk On."" But to me U2 always meant energy, not song after song of boring pop. Their last CD had a few problems, but also real guts in places. In the last part of POP, the creativity and energy died, and it carries to this CD (though Beautiful Day is nice enough). At least try to listen through the CD before buying."
0,Bad acting kills great potential.,"Anyone calling this movie brilliant is either too obsessed with Patton or one of Balderson's paid employees. Yes, the opening is brilliant and the colors and style of this film are nothing short of fantastic. But Karen Black's performance is beyond emberassing, and Mike Patton even said himself he is no actor - and it shows.It was very uncomfortable and difficult to watch this film in its entirety, which is a real shame because it could have been an incredible experience. Instead the potential was shattered by phony acting. Sad to say it, but avoid this movie at all costs."
0,Great seller but movie not working...,"Great seller, very understanding. Refundable my money immediately. I will buy again from this seller. Very nice and friendly."
1,Better than most Heep albums!,"Still enjoying my original vinyl on this one, although I wish a domestic (i.e., cheaper) version were available on CD. In retrospect, although it is pretty mellow, I like this album better than most of the Heep albums themselves. In fact, you could almost consider this just a more introspective Heep album, as Hensley is their main songwriter anyways, and Uriah bassist Thain is also on the album. Some great songwriting here, and Ken's voice is as good in its own way as Byron's. One of my favorite albums after almost 25 years! I just wish he were still putting out stuff like this and ""Demons""!!"
0,So wrong,There is just something horrible about listening to this. Even if a punk band is going to cover some pop songs there is no reason to hear them singin the boy band crap
1,Tim is a hottie,I just love this cd....its my favorite other than kenny chesneys greatest hits is the best of the best. This cd really does have all of his best songs
1,Very good,"It is very well made and humorous, but it is slightly boring in some parts, so I'd give it 4 stars."
0,Original,"Taken from Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary:Original (adjective): 2 a: that from which a copy, reproduction, or translation is made b: a work composed firsthandSo, ok George, I think you got the idea about what is original and what is not.

1,Astouding literature but unnecisary reviews.,"J.R.R. Tolkien is one of my prefered authors being, along with Homer one of the greatest authors of all time! But while the story itself is excellent I have to ask, why do people continue to comment on the binding and illustrations when this is the kindle edition which lacks illustrations and you only have abinding if you bought a case!"
1,first bread machine. made 20 loaves,"I got this for Christmas. I tried 5 different recipes out of the included book and tried them each twice... The recipes suckand really made me feel like I or the machine was horrible. I ended up buying better homes and gardens bread book. First loaf...awesome. Second loaf awesome.. im on my 5th different bread from that book and they all are awesome. Inoticed they never usemore than 1tsp yeast... the included book uses more. Expressbake overbaked for me, but I only tried the included recipe. Will try a BHG recipe next and see. Replacement pans/paddles cost almost as much as the whole bread machine. Bought extras to bake one after the other and was suprised to find it was $30"
0,Nonstick properties - or rather lack thereof,"I liked this pan because it was a good size for two people. However, I did not like it's nonstick properties, or rather lack thereof. I had to soak and scrub, and soak and scrub, every time I used it and it was still dirty! So, I've been hating it, but trying not to throw it away. The pan underneath had some kind coating that been slowly peeling off. I'm glad I don't use that for cooking. Finally I cooked a meal that I could not get off and that was that, into the trash it went."
1,Refreshing new artist,I heard Anthony David on XM Satellite and knew that he had a style very different from what I normally hear on radio. The entire CD is fresh and relaxing. This is take anywhere kind of music.
1,Smallville season 7 deserves 10/5!!!,This was one of the best seasons ever! Great action and great stories in each episode! You wont be able to stop watching it after you buy this collection. I highly recommend it for every smallville fan and new fans as well. Dont believe the ones that gave this 1 star. why? because they either hate superman or they just want to get attention. This is a MUST HAVE for all!
0,\/ Objective Review \/,"So I'm reviewing this CD as an objective listener. I listen to mostly west coast rap. I DJ too. So I've heard a lot. This CD is no more than bubblegum. DJ Clue? Fabolous? So there ya go. This guys the Fabolous of the west coast...in fact ill bet if you read transcripts of their lyrics without hearing the songs you wouldnt be able to tell them apart.I dislike it when people who are popular in NY get their whole region on their backs. Like TI. TI isnt the king of the south hes the NY king of the south. And shade sheist is just another MC out of 100 brought to you by Artist and Repertoire. He claims a lot to be the new west coast but like i said, hes the NY new west coast. To be honest tho, this guy could be great...his flows are pretty good and the beats is aiight. But if he had some good cali beats and the freedom to write whatever he wants it would be a lot better."
0,Did not receive genuine Annin flag!,"I see I am not the only one who is receiving US flags that are similar to Annin Nyl-Glo flags, but are not. They are cheaper, the grommets don't hold up, there is no Annin or Nyl-Glo logo anywhere, and to add to the disgrace, my flag actually came with permanent marker or ink or a black stain on one of the white stripes.I have kept this flag indoors in my office and will be wary of buying from here again. I bought it from BC novelties and this wasn't the only defaced flag they sent. So others should be wary when ordering this flag or from this company. You may not get a new or even an Annin Nyl-Glo flag.I'm just disappointed, no stores near me seem to have any good US flag for sale and more and more, online sellers are sending cheap made in China flags of which there is no bigger disgrace to buy a US flag made in China."
0,Well....,".I don't think a band sells out every time they change style, and I don't think korn sold out.They simply weakened. It's a halfhearted attempt without the energy of the first album. They lack most of the distinctiveness they once had. Borrow the CD and don't buy it. Some of it is ok and gets you going, but some of it just plain sux. A major disappointment."
1,about the book,"Peter Gregory Thurland Sr. lived on St. Croix under both Danish and American rule. He witnessed the tremendous economic and social and political changes his native land endured. He worked for the betterment of the island by contributing to its culture and economy.Mr. Thurland, as he was affectionately called by everyone, served his community as a manual arts and vocational teacher, music teacher, the founder and first bandmaster of the St. Croix Community Band, a co founder of the Alexander Hamilton American Legion Post, a community activist and a master cabinetmaker. His mahogany work is a testimony of his creative talents. His fine pieces of furniture will survive for future generations to appreciate."
0,Dakini Lounge,"I didnot enjoy this CD. I usually love Prem Joshua--Sky Kisses Earth, Water Down the Ganges and Tales of a Dancing River--loved them. But this one was repetitive and dull. I missed all the exciting changes, rhythms and provacative moods provided by Prem Joshua recordings. This is literally a ""lounge around recording""."
1,Real life situations piled and filed humerously :-),"Finally someone who takes a real life approach to the complex world of household management...or at the very least taming it!!! I could relate to so many of the situations and the help Karen offers is so real! I am not a misfit...I just have bent chromosomes and that is OK! Filled with funny stories too, can't wait for the other books to hit the market! Keep up the GREAT work Karen."
0,Not much artwork on big game,"Not sure I was pleased with the contents of this art book. The cover features a big leopard, so I assumed the book covered big game and large cats and other mammals. The book was 80% paintings of birds. Many of the featured artists were ""no-names"" so don't let the cover fool you into thinking this is another wildlife art book with the likes of Bateman and Seery Lester."
0,No Show,"Can't review it as I have not seen it yet - one month and 2 days since ordered, 1 month since they say it shipped."
0,...,"I don't recommend this product. The appliance doesn't stay warm long enough to do the entire face. It stays warm long enough to do one side of face. One other problem is with the unit itself, if just lays in the charger so if it is bumped it could lose the charge connection easily."
1,Pleasant creation (a'las) ... Accoustics vocals & instruments!,I liked a number of songs on this CD. I'm happy to know that the song which first caused me to get this CD is the first track! I absolutely adore it. I expect more surprises coming from this fine and becoming artist in the future. Sara Bareilles's LITTLE VOICE CD is actually heard in a magnetically loud voice. Her songs are strong and uplifting as well as real as can be without the punching bag lyrics. I give her high accolades for this effort. Most songwriting (music) today have a lot of punching bag aura. * * * * *
0,Disco Beat Overwhelming,"Although I found Richard's first two workouts to be fun and enjoyed the music, I got a migraine from the booming, disco beat that overwhelmed Richards voice on this dvd. If I turned my dvd player down, I couldn't hear directions."
0,Maxell dry video head cleaner,"It is very simple to use. But it doesn't seem to work. For example: the playback of a movie that I video tape may be very bad from the visual standpoint, although the audio is OK. There will appear on the screen a notice that my video head may need cleaning. I remove the tape that was visibly defective and insert the dry video head cleaner and follow the simple instructions. When the cleaning cycle is completed, I then remove the video head cleaner and reinsert the tape that was visibly bad. There is little, if any, improvement. Shortly thereafter, I insert a new tape that I recorded on. The notice again appears on the screen that my video head needs cleaning, even though I cleaned them the same day or one or two days earlier. If it worked, it would have been a good product. No liquid to insert, reasonably priced, and easy to use. But it did not work."
1,Gr8,This book is very reasonably priced. It will be a excellent read. A very easy read. Five stars all the way!!!!!
0,Really disappointing,"I purchased a box of these after reading the 5 star rave reviews. Sorry, but these remind me of the first generation Powerbars. You have to chew them so much your jaw aches. I will not buy them again. The taste is tolerable. If you want a good tasting and good texture energy bar, try Clif bars."
0,Not For Me,"This book has very long, complicated ingredient lists, and you definiteley need a dehydrater. I also could have done without the half-naked pictures of the author on every other page. I sent it back."
0,Unclear if this book is a good resource or not,"As a previous reviewer pointed out, some rather simple mistakes on the 10th problem (not corrected in the 1985ed, btw) cast a shadow on the reliability of this book. Many other problems seem to be worked out correctly, but it's beyond me to check every one. The book is helpful in spots, but the fact that they answered ""105%"" for ""What percent of 100 is 99.5?"" leaves me more than a bit unsure of their subsequent answers. As a math teacher, I would suggest a basic textbook instead of this (you'll have graphics anyway, which are critical to understanding math well)."
0,Don't Buy This Book,"As a pubished author, I hesitated writing a negative review of this book. I know the amount of time it takes to put a book together and I wanted to be respectful of a fellow author.I won't blame the author solely for the final product. Her editor should have advised her on how to make this book stand behind the title - Syndication Secrets.There are no secrets in this book. In fact, a quick Google search and one can find out the information contained in the book. The information she provided is so readily available that they are hardly secret and don't fall under the category ""What No One Will Tell You."""
1,Reread an old favorite.,"Saw this in the amazon books available. Read it in High School, and had to read it again. A great read, not as techy as newer sci-fi. Good book."
1,Much Better Than Syphon Filter,"This is a great game. There are endless exciting fights and challenges, and the puzzles are reasonable. A few words of warning: The cimema scenes are endless, sometimes as long as 20 consecutive minutes, and often your desire to keep playing will frustrate. Some of the boss fights (such as the second meetings with Raven and Wolf) seem impossible and can be frustrating. This is also a short game - it took me about 12 hours, and I'm no gaming expert. It may also leave unfulfilled, but that is more due to the excellent gameplay than a subpar ending.Now that its $20, I strongly urge you to buy it if it sounds at all interesting to you."
0,Good luck getting it to work with Mac OS 10.2 or above.,"Make sure you can find version 1.0.4 of the PL-2303 driver from iConcepts before buying this adapter. The version which ships with the adapter is an older version and won't work with Mac OS 10.2. BTW, good luck finding version 1.0.4 of the driver. I found hits through google saying the driver was available at some point from iConcepts, but it's not there now (Their support site sucks too). Piece of advice, do not buy this adapter if plugging onto a Mac running 10.2. It's not worth the hassle.Now I have an adapter which doesn't do anything but look pretty. It'll work fine with the classic environment and probably all the Microsoft OS's but does absolutely nothing with Mac 10.2."

1,Permission Marketing is just Relationship Marketing,"This book help you to understand the importance of ""relationship building"" in the world of marketing mix. Customers, employees, marketing services' companies..three in one. Relationship marketing is the key to today and future communications.Overall, Marketing is just a game of relationship. If you are good, you are the winner. If someone positions better than you, you fail. Creativity, the big idea and image building are all folded in one paragraph, the skill of bulding and keeping the Relationship. That's it, period."
0,Terrible,"I kept reading with the hope that it would improve, there was so much room for it to have gotten better. Instead it got even worse. Save your money and your time."
0,Collins' descent into utter blandness is nearly complete,"I really wish I had spent my money on something else and not this CD. (Those who think it's impossible for Phil to make bad music should probably stop reading at this point.) I used to really enjoy and appreciate his songs, especially back in the late '70s and early '80s with Genesis, and his first couple of solo albums. I remember when a new Phil Collins Cd was a cause for excitement. Now every song is full of light and fluffy synthesizers, and the melodies are so forgettable. They have no more staying power than a breeze through the trees in my back yard. There's really no point in talking about individual songs -- if you think of his songs for children's animated films, this album is like that only worse. Listening to this CD was a very similar experience to listening to elevator music for an hour."
1,David Gilmour,"Fantastic!! Second DVD pays acoustic guitar solo tribute to Syd Barrett's: "" Dark Globe"". Better than Syds performance. The concert is real and from the heart with excellent sound, picture quality and camera shots."
0,I wish I could give it Zero Stars,"This movie was not funny, it was just crude and disgusting. These girls are good actors. I wish they would choose better material."
0,Amazingly boring,"Ok, the special effects are great for the time this movie was made, but that's really all this movie has going for it. I am most disappointed by having to give this a full star rating. The plot is mechanical with a lame voice-over back story. The characters shallow and lacking any legitimate motivations or redeeming quality. Honestly, I can't see what all the hype is about."
0,Terrible Vendor do not use Comparashop,"Terrible product, arrived damaged, packaging was a joke...More off putting was Comparashop's terrible customer service. I was given the run around for two weeks, never got return phone calls, put on hold for up to 45 minutes and disconnected, dealt with extremely dull witted people who never had any record of who I was each time I called. After awhile they turned on an answering machine with no live customer service reps to speak with. Finally, resolved it through Amazon directly...do NOT use Comparshop unless your into pain and suffering."
1,Worked perfectly,"I was skeptical about this product, but given the price I said ""why not"" since I had these pesky birds using my covered patio as a haven from the Arizona heat and my patio furniture as their personal toilet. I cut (4) three foot pieces of the ribbon and clipped them onto a closed yard umbrella positioned close to my covered patio (sort of like a wind chime) and it's been several months now without a sign of white dung anywhere on my patio. Apparently the reflection paired with the regular breeze we have produces enough movement to keep the birds away. I couldn't be happier with this product. It doesn't keep the birds away entirely we still have them visit the edges of the yard, the waterfall of our pool along with some of our flowering plants mostly the smaller finches and hummers (all about 50 ft away from the tape), I could add some more tape in different areas but I don't really care if they're at the edges as long as I have a clean place to sit."
0,Fat and easily breakable,"At first I really liked this Gigabeat. It lasted about three months though as one small drop broke the player, disallowing it to play music. The Gigabeat is a very thick media device and by now I don't really suggest you buy it as there are plenty of other mp3 devices for the same price that are much more advanced than this one. The only thing I really liked about this Gigabeat was its loud sound."
0,This Music's Got Absolutely No Feel To It,"Simply put, this is one of the five worst albums/CD's I've ever heard and I've listened to well over five thousand of them. I'm a 40 year Beatles fan and am not at all anti-McCartney. This ""music"" is bland, lifeless and duller than a speech by Dick Cheney. After reading all the glowing pre-release hoopla, I was literally stunned by how weak this music is."
0,Dud charger,I have two of these chargers. They are absolute junk. I use only Energizer batteries. The charger I bought last week is worse than the one I thought was broke. It constantly shows the flashing red light when I charge a set of batteries except for the included set of new batteries. These are all fairly new batteries. I will avoid Energizer products in the future.
0,A lot of build-up with no pay-off whatsoever,"I have to agree with the reviewers who said this should have been a short story- might have made for a creepy Paul Bowlesian one.I could tell within the first 100 pages where the build-up was going nowhere and kind of lost trust in the author. I could tell that ""the plants did it,"" and the protagonists were not worth staying with for the duration, so I had to put it down. Looks like I made the right decision."

0,Kal Korff Lies to Sell Books,"Kal Korff will also tell you that he works for the CIA, among other of his nonsense claims. Such LIES come out of both sides of his mouth at once, it's a wonder how the man eats."
0,A bit too preachy and pretty..,"I grew up reading Johnathon Livingston Seagull over and over, and became a fan of Richard Bach after reading a few of his other books later in life, but with One it seems he's become too comfortable in his role as an always-inspiring and thought-provoking author, and didn't strain himself to be either. The book rambles on quite a bit and has an extremely different tone than something like Illusions. Still made you think a few times, but I definitely didn't feel at all enlightened when reading it. Very mushy and soft throughout, and occasionally even preachy and self-righteous. I'd recommend one of his earlier books over this."
0,Not working!,"The thermal bottle is not working! Boiled water gets cold within a couple of hours! It's leaking too, though only a few drops of water coming out of the bottle when I inversed it! Not recommend for anyone!"
0,Not the best out there,My one and only complaint is that they fall out. You can in now way force these giant things into your ear canal. They pop out and dont fit right. The sound was good the fit was not.
1,A masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This movie is a masterpiece!After 10 minutes you will either be hooked into it and enjoy the amazing ride or you will give up on it and shake your head in disbelief.Dont be hard on yourself if you do,people either love ""Donnie Darko"" or hate it, there is no middle ground.Well I love it!Nough said!"
1,Very good product,These needles come in very handy when double-checking on gold and silver jewelry. It's that extra insurance when you are in the process of confirming the validity of the gold or silver content and it's reaction to acids. Good to have when you are having doubts about the precious metal content of the product you are assessing. It was delivered on time and packaged carefully!
1,Devotional Guide with Depth,"Julie Morris is an excellent writer and has a way of seeing the root of the problem. This is a very thorough devotional guide and gives many practical applications for working through your problems. Many devotional books I have used have just been a few paragraphs that have a good message and by noon I have forgotten all about it, but From Worry To Worship has much more depth."

I usually get her book as soon as it comes out and try to make it last a week. I fly through her books because they are truly page-turners....but this book is terrible. I had to FORCE myself to finish this one. Skip it and go to the next one in line.

0,"Should Have Called This Album ""Vomitorium""","Elling's cheesy, contrived, soulless vocalese take on Coltrane's ""Resolution"" is one of the worst songs I have ever heard in my life. He should be ashamed of himself for violating such a great tune with his ridiculous lyrics and silly delivery."
1,It works - better dental check ups since using Sonicare,"Since I've been using Sonicare my 6 month check ups at the dentist have been great! I was using a similar product by another company, but didn't get the same results. Purchasing replacement heads through Amazon was cheaper than elsewhere and shipped right to my door. Thanks Amazon."
0,Un-useable junk,This whole 6.0 digital phone system is garbage. I cannot hold a conversation due to the dropouts during a conversation. Its like using a cell phone in a fringe service area. Saying it isn't affected by static interference is a blatent lie! I'm throwing the whole thing in the garbage where it belongs. A total waste of money
1,Reviews from Brizmus Blogs Books,"What can I say? I loved this book. It was very much a Young Adult novel, and while I don't think I would recommend it to just anyone, I did think it was an exceptionally fantastic YA novel. There's spies, there's girly girls, there's love, there's comedy, there's fluff, there's action - what else could a girl ask for from a YA novel? And it's written in such a way that I believed I was actually listening to Cammie, the main character, and not Ally Carter, the author. A lot of YA authors, I find, have trouble making that happen.Anyhow, this book was just adorable. And come on, a book that happens in a boarding school for girls training to be spies - that's just awesome!Who Should Read This Book?Pretty much anyone interested in YA books, especially light-hearted, fluffy ones."
1,It's a western for people who like westerns.... DUH!,"This is a new western... will it go down as a classic -- no. But, I have seen those classic westerns, know their plots inside out and this is a decent recent film that certainly does justice to those famous western good/evil conflicts. It is not entirely unpredictable, but who thought John Wayne wasn't going to ride off into the sunset?"
1,We all need Mr. Roger's Neighborhood,"As with all the Mr. Roger's Neighborhood programs, you and your child will go away feeling better about yourself after watching. A Day at the Circus also gives you a behind the scene glimpse of a world totally foreign to most of us which is a good lead-in to discussing how people are all different yet all the same. We need more shows like this to prepare our children for life. My granddaughter asks to watch it over and over again."
1,Everthing you wanted to know about promoting community theatre,This book provided me with all of the essential information required to promote our local community theatre. It introduced me to ideas such as homegrown press releases and helped me to understand the how the media sees the local theatre.I highly recommend this book to everyone involved in community theatre.
1,I COULD NOT IMAGINE WHAT SHE COULD POSSIBLY DO NEXT!!!,"I have been impatiently awaiting for this album:)...People say that they played a few of her songs on the radio so much that they didn't care to purchase the CD. Well... that is there lost because if you don't listen to the CD you are truly missing out:(Anyway - Back to the Voyage:) I could not imagine how India could possibly top the previous album. She did ""NOT"" fail me:) To be honest, when I listened to Acoustic Soul... I loved ""EVERY TRACK"". Now, with the Voyage... I love it... but I can't say better than the first. I am not disappointed at the least bit and I love 8 out of 10 songs:)That song ""truth"" is hot!!!! She has quite a bit of songs that are nice. She must be in love or something because she is showing how much she appreciates her ""King"":) I love her for that:)"
1,LOL (see page 93),I picked this up in the bookstore and was laughing so hard I had to buy it before security had me removed. Still laughing.
1,The Best Hard House CD Ever,"None of that slow deep house stuff, it's all fast and all wicked, the best of techno, trance-rave, and Hard House but Wicked Style!. The only hard house cd I've found that didn't have any deep house and every track was worth listening to. This guy needs to make another cd. Someone contact him!"
0,Run away from this book! Run!!!!,"I became aware of this book through Los Angeles radio talk show host John Ziegler, who was reading segments of it on his program nightly complete with appropriately sappy background music. The chapters I heard were SO bad...I wanted to take a shower afterwards, but being that I was at work I was out of luck. Knowing this terrible senator's political leanings and her impossibly stupid commentary in the media, I guess it isn't surprising this ditzy piece of trash came from her. What is surprising is that it was published at all. Have we no standards anymore? I had to give it one star because a zero star rating is not possible here. Please, Barbara, no more novels from you....keep your mouth shut and your pen capped."
1,"Batteries work, but are OLD from 2006.....",I ordered one set of 2016 3v Energizer batteries. The batteries are Energizer but they came in 2 individual aluminum packets rather than the advertised 2-pack. The date on the back of the each packet says 2006. We'll see if that effects the battery life......many months later batteries still work.
0,Dead less then two years later.,"Bought these in 1/2009 and never pushed them, I don't play music overtly loud, ever. The unit died on me 12/2010. speakers are fine, the board in the woofer must have just died. Not happy."
1,A great sword,"the sword came two days after I bought it. the 'made in pakistan' can be rubed off with no problems. looks nice, a great find for the price."
1,Awesome,"This is just one great little camera. We were going on a cruise vacation to Mexico and both I and the wife needed new cameras. For myself I got the latest and greatest from Nikon the 8800 and she got the Casio which she just loves. The interesting thing was that on vacation no one came rushing over to look at and wow my new Nikon but they sure did with her. It seemed like very time she took a picture someone would come over and ask about it. It is simple to use, ultra small and takes wonderful photos."
1,The only pen I will ever use!,"I work in a fast moving retail sales business where the pen is an important tool. I have used the Pilot Better Ball Point Pen for about 20 years. I use them all day, every day and these Pilot pens have never failed to write! These pens are in and out of my pocket many times every day, they always write and I have never had one malfunction in any way. The metal pocket clips never fall off, they always retract properly, etc. When I hand one to a customer to sign a sales order or receipt they frequently comment on how well they write. They are just the right size and while not fancy, they don't look or feel cheap. In my opinion, this the best pen available. They are just about impossible to buy where I live today, near Tampa, Fl. I am glad Amazon carries them. This is one the best products I have ever used."
1,Inside The Mind Of A Child,"My mother first bought this book for my oldest son. It has endured as a beloved favorite to all three of my boys. I think that children can really identify with Max and his thoughts. When he is sent to his room for misbehavior, his imagination helps him to run away to where the wild things are and collect his thoughts. I believe that the author must remember what its like to be a child and feel like no one understands, and not quite understanding yourself. Ruling the wild things helps Max understand that he just wants to feel loved, and helps parents to keep in mind that such outbursts from children are generally cries for attention--for someone to love them best of all. Mr. Sendak understands children! When you read this book it will transport you back to your own childhood and you will remember that lost feeling of being a child. Bravo, Maurice! You are my hero!"
0,This thing sucks,It turns off your xbox when you just want to watch tv. There is no video select switch and you to press seven buttons to get anything to work. The software wont fix any problems with it and you have to point it at whtever it is you want to work even with brand new batteries. You can get most of thee features with a ten dollar universal remote. Dont waste your money on this crap. Trust me. Complete waste of money!!!
1,I love it,Butt it do's seem like it's a long play but i can still relate to it I'm watching I'm watching it for the second time i went to sleep on it the fist time around i just got today as well
1,Flying,"I bought this game for my grandson-13 and he was very happy with it, although I thought the grafics of the cities and marinas lacking in detail."
0,I Shuddered....,"IMHO, when a movie resorts to the cheap scare - people jumping out, accompanied by loud blasts of discordant music - it's time to move on to something more productive. This amateurish annoyance must have been employed half a dozen times in Shutter Island. Frankly, one would hope for better from Scorsese. The good acting and gothic sensibilities of the movie were badly weighted down by plot holes and a ""surprise"" ending you could see coming long before it arrived."
0,Comes apart at swivel,"My wife had one of these for two years and it came apart at one of the swivel joints in the handle. I purchased a replacement ... which came apart at a swivel joint after only one day. The vendor kindly sent another, which also has a swivel joint that looks pretty suspicious ... time will tell."
0,Bid-X Tape,"We purchased this product hoping it would limit the amount of barn swallows that were using our boat for a bathroom. It did not work. I think it attracted more swallows to see if they would completely cover our boat. Sorry we wasted the money for the tape, pole and hardware to mount it."
0,Older version - beware!,I was expecting the lastest version - it was version 2.0 not 3.0 and it will cost to upgrade - find another supplier who will give you the lastest - shame on you Amazon!
0,Broke in 20 minutes,Cracked within 20 minutes of instulation with kids just playing normal BB. Replacement on order hope it last longer. Anyone else have such issues?
0,not as good as the daddy version,"sadly, the storyline of this book is not good.because if you already have the ""i love you daddy"" book , that storyline rocks! our baby loves it and wants us to read it over and over again. and so it makes my husband look like a daddy rock-star compared to the ""i love you mommy"" book. i am embarrassed to read this one because the storyline makes her an overprotective, whiny, fun spoiling mother. the only good this book is for---- for a daddy to read it and make a mockery of the mommy."
0,horrid vocals,These vocals are laughable- I love prog music- dont get me wrong- BUT THIS IS ALMOST A JOKE!!! If you disagree- call me at 559-392-1587- my name is Kevin- HORRID MUSIC
1,Informative,Solid book with good information for those interested in modern day paganism. More of a historical approach that helps a person understand how we got to where we are. Great read.
0,Don't bother,Not worth the money. It's a freakin' showerhead. Doesn't even focus spray well.Doubt I'll buy another. Way over-rated. Go to Wallmart.
1,Grumpier and better,"This film is one of the rare instances of the sequel being even better than the original...and I liked the original very much. Jack Lemmon exibits his beautiful dramatic ability (especially in the scene where ""Pop"" dies), and the comic genius of the pair is superb. Add the beautiful Sophia Loren and the hilarious out-takes, and you have a really fun picture to enjoy again and again."
0,Very tedious,This is probably the single most tedious textbook I have ever read. I learned more from spending ~10 hours in SQL server 2008 and w3schools messing around than I did from reading this book.
0,Not for a novice!!,"I had taken a drawing class five years ago as an absolute beginner and i learned quite a bit.Sorry to say that i hadn't picked up a drawing pencil since, so i decided to buy this book as a refresher and to learn some new skills but I was so disappointed in the lack of instruction given. The drawings in this book are absolutely amazing but I feel that for a beginner or novice it is terribly difficult to break them down into simple shapes and to figure out how to layer the shading. Even though this may have been a book book of drawing it is severely lacking in important basic information and should have been made even larger to accommodate a more in-depth approach."
0,I expected more ...,I expected more from this product.I did not find it all that is described.the scent does not remain for very long.
1,This book has excellent variety!,"Ken Leebow has done what everybody wished, took time to search the net and organize it in a way that is fun, and easy! It offers great sites including educational, productive, and funny! Buy this book, you will not regret it."
1,A Fragile Time Captured,"""Blue Man Falling"" by Frank Barnard , is a fascinating glimpse into the fragile, often bizarre days of the ""Phony War"", that ""wishful thinking"" period of WW II when few believed the Nazis would actually invade France. Accordingly, one day we find an RAF Hurricane pilot engaging in a dogfight with his German counterpart and the next we see him enjoying a drink in a Parisian cafe. This jarring juxtaposition of moods illustrates all too well the surrealistic nature of that period. Mr. Barnard has a great ability to capture a ""sense of place"" whether he's describing a French farmhouse, a British barrack, or the Hotel Crillon. He also portrays convincingly the comaraderie and the rivalry among the ""blue men"", as well as their romances. I found this to be a very readable and well written book about a period not widely understood."
0,Worst pad ever!,"I bought this heating pad to ease the foot cramps I get. It is very slow to heat up and produces very little heat. The instructions for the pad have all kind of dire warning about burning yourself on the heat produced. The warnings make no sense to me since has never come close to too much heat. The problem is getting any heat at all. As I said in the title line, this is the worst pad I've ever used."
0,The Emperor's New Clothes,"I have been teaching calculus at a university for over 20 years. I was on the adoption committee to select calculus texts. I had heard that the Stewart text was a national best seller, so I volunteered to review it. I was startled. I can see now reason why this text is widely used. It is even more difficult to believe that its author has had any classroom experience with honest-to-goodness calculus students. The writing is rambling and obtuse. The design is not helpful and blends prose with examples. The art is irregular, some art is small and some is huge, some topics that cry for graphs have none and some that don't need graphs have several. I have used several other texts and it appears that the author used a cut and paste technique to create this text, taking liberally from other best sellers. After a careful review of this ""popular"" text, I felt obligated to write this review. Someone needs to point out that the ""emperor is not wearing any clothes!"""
0,Very Poor Software,"I bought this software to design a floor plan for a house. When just laying out the walls, its user interface is very crude. I found I had problems placing walls and could not nudge them to the positions I wanted once they touched another wall perpendicular to them. As a result I continually had to delete and redraw. Eventually I started placing objects such as a bathtub or a door. This became a fatal blow to the program. Adding even a couple of objects slows the program down so much that is useless."
1,great glasses,"These are great 12 oz glasses, nicely shaped, easy to hold, easy to clean, looks good on the table because the glass is so clear."
0,Poor Clasp,I bought this bracelet for christmas. it lasted one day the clasp would not stay closed. and part of the clasp broke off. not worth your money
1,One of the rare one's.,"I took me awhile to watch this feature, I finally did once I saw it avalible on iTunes, so I downloaded it to my iPod touch and my goodness! This movie blew me away! It's been a long time since i've seen a movie that's directly aimed at adults, genius written, beautifully shot. There wasnt one complaint coming from me."
1,Warn Winch Plug-in Wired Remote,"This plug-in wired winch remote is not a must, but nether is a powered tire inflator, an elevator, or a television remote. This remote simply makes things a whole lot easier when you go to use the winch. Don't forget to store it with the winch, it can't help you if you forget to bring it."
0,dont get this,"this is the worst piece ok crap i have ever bought for my xbox. I dont even know where to start. The glue job on the lights was so messy, it was all over the tunnnel. It wouldnt fit over the CPU heatsink without bending 2 of the lights. It caused my whole motherboard in my xbox to fry and caused me to have the red ring of death. Whatever you do, dont buy this part for your xbox because you will regret it. Sure in the picture it looks cool but it is a poorly made part that causes trouble."
1,Love can overcome time,"I got lost in the pages of In My Next Life. Michal Sands does a great job re-creating times long gone through the memories of his main character, Mark Nevon. And what a thrilling chase he creates when Mark finds out that his soul mate lives again in a young woman he has recently met. A great conflict is produced when Mark has to struggle between his growing love...and concern... for his soulmate and his faltering marriage. Very true to life. And the conversations throughout are realistic and flowing. I loved the ending. It makes me hope for true love, and it makes me believe there is a reason for our soul mates, even if we haven't realized we've met them yet."
0,My two cents,"""These current defacements are just the beginning. Today, engineers with their computers can add color to black-and-white movies, change the soundtrack, speed up the pace, and add or subtract material to the philosophical tastes of the copyright holder. Tommorrow, more advanced technology will be able to replace actors with ""fresher faces,"" or alter dialogue and change the movement of the actor's lips to match. It will soon be possible to create a new ""original"" negative with whatever changes or alterations the copyright holder of the moment desires.""-George Lucas in a speech to Congress in 1988 about Preserving Works of Art."
1,Fable is a great RPG,"Great game. I love the combat control. I wish you could actually fight in the Knights of the Old Republic star wars games. In Fable you can!! You control your characters dodging, weapon attacks and combos, magic attacks and item use all in real time. They did a great job of it and it is a joy to play. I hope they make a FABLE 2 for xbox next."
1,Good game to pass the time,I really like this game. You can start with predetermined families or create new ones. I have never played the sims before so it took a little time to get used to it. I recommend getting some expansion packs to make more of your game.
0,Even swine wiLl turn away from this garbage,"Gratefully, Disney has wised up since the era of putting out animated garbage in the theaters and believing it will automatically turn a profit.As to whoever hired Rosanne Barr, may God have mercy on your soul. Fitting though, that her annoying vocal ""talents"" (liberally used like her and cake) are best suited amongst lowly farm animals prepped for slaughter for our consumption.Of the many great animated Disney movies deserving of the blue ray treatment, this is by far one that should never be considered. It's like last call at a bar and you are not sure if it's a masculine girl or not that you seen alone in a dark corner, but it's late and that little voice of reason that can barely be heard not to do something stupid......yeah, this is that time.Do not buy this movie."
0,Buyer Beware,"I can echo all of the same comments other users have about this vacuum. From the burning smell of the beater bar to the wallowing cannister to finding the special bags it all adds up to an expensive mistake. Why haven't appliance makers been able to ""get it together"" by now?"
0,Doesn't fit the Garmin GPS 76CSX,"Bought it as I thought it would work well with the Garmin GPS 76CSX. Not happy. The item is sitting in my drawer, as it is a greater expense of time and money to return it."
1,Keep Up Appearances- Brit Comedy,So darn funny. Absolutely love these epidsodes. Patricia Routledge is fantastic. Looking for more episodes. Will keep looking. British Comedy at it's best.
1,Exceeded my expectations,"I ordered this bed for my 4-year old as he was outgrowing his toddler bed. I had my sights on this bed for awhile; however, I was hesitant based on some poor reviews and the fact it was made from particle board. I decided to take a chance and ordered the bed using Amazon's free shipping and it still arrived ahead of the schedule delivery. It arrived intact with no cracks or other signs of defects as others had experienced. Assembly was easy; those claiming difficulty were either incapable of operating a phillips screw driver or looking at directions. Even with the drawers installed, there is still plenty of usable storage space behind the drawers for items such as seasonal clothing. To access this additional space, simply move the mattress and lift the included bunkie board which consists of two half pieces - not that hard. If you're looking for a decent bed and don't wish to spend a lot of money, this bed is highly recommended."
0,I GOT THE LEMON,I might be the only one unhappy with this product but after I lifted the mattress off of the box springs and started to attach it to the frame the buckel broke. The quality seemed to be poor the plastic was cheap and the straps were thin. I must say the transaction went very well. The item arrived very quickly and the return was a breeze. F.Y.I. I did find one for my large husband at Elderdepot.com and he is very happy with it and he does feel secure with this type of device. I do recommend anyone needing this type of device to purchase one.
0,Is Rick writing his own Bible?,"As one who claims to represent Christ, Rick has left out the most important part, the Bible. A true prophet will always point to Christ, through the Bible and not to themselves. As much as I liked Rick's writings in the past I'm afraid he's fallen into deception of the worst kind - he believes he's a prophet. John the Baptist was the 'last' prophet, ""for all the prophets and the law prophesied until (up to) John."" (parentheses mine - Matt. 11:13) Christians must remember that anyone who claims to speak for God will point to the Bible as the 'final authority' - not dreams."
1,Almost there..,I purchased this grip to replace a Magpul MOE on my S&W 15-22. I didn't like the Magpul because it felt like hard plastic. This grip has a great feel and seems to fit my average sized hands nicely. I'd have given 5 stars if it had a larger thumb swell and a cover for the bottom so it could be used to store small items. I would recommend this grip to anyone with a AR15 style weapon.
1,Best place to experience the cult of the New American chef.,"""The husband-and-wife writing team of Andrew Dornenburg and Karen Page -- he is a chef, she a journalist -- has produced four books in the past six years, and these are the best place to experience the cult of the New American chef. The most over-the-top of their books is the second, CULINARY ARTISTRY, which is dedicated to 'the original Creator' and goes on to treat the chef as being only a small notch down from Him. 'We have been awed by the unusual levels of perceptiveness we've experienced America's leading chefs as possessing; we believe some to have certain skills of extrasensory perception,"" they write. The assumption underlying CULINARY ARTISTRY is that being a great chef, like being a great artist, is far more a matter of talent than of training, and that making great food is a matter of imaginatively, instinctively combining flavors -- Abstract Expressionism with coulis.""--Nicholas Lemann, THE NEW YORKER"
0,Didn't even make it a year,I purchased this dryer in Feb. '09 and it started sparking today while I was drying my hair. I've never had a dryer go out so quickly - most have lasted 2-3 yrs. and cost much less. I don't recommend this Chi dryer.
1,one of his best...,"I have read most of his books and was delighted with this one. The adventure and the story line taking place in Spain was great. I realized how little I knew about Spainish history. What a great author, I was ready to join the rebels when the convent was attacked..."
0,Don't waste your time,"This is horrible quality, poorly made, and can't handle much. It is great if you are living in a condo or townhouse and need to transport a few flowers from one side to the other. But it isn't for any type of serious yard work."
1,good movie...,another comic book turned movie... the late hulk movie about 20 years ago was a ed wood in my book but this one is loaded with cgi and just a good movie. better then daredevil the action is great except for the carried on begining... they dragged on the characters a little to much. well not as good as spiderman or x men it is deffetally a good movie to see on a boring day interesting tid bit that ang lee the director turned down the change to direct terminator 3 to direct this! COMPLETELY SURPRIZING but probably should have been
0,Blargh,"Another one?I saw this on Disney's cartoon channel. (Toon Disney?) And I was so very glad I had not invested any money in purchasing or renting it. It felt cheap, corny, and just wrong. Why did this film need to be *made*?The film was really three different stories - and I felt that each one added very little to the Cinderella story at all. The fairy godmother is just now apparently everyone's fairy godmother. Even the mouse!While some younger girls I know liked the film, they agreed it wasn't up to the standard of the orginal stories. Frankly, Walt Disney would be sick. Why he isn't haunting the heck out of the company's higher-ups, I'll never know.Don't bother with this one."
1,Great Product,Very soft and warm. My wife was very happy with getting these. The price was right and they were promptly delivered.
0,Used for FIN 4763,"Even though my professor didn't use the book as much as I expected, the content of this one were merely boring lectures explained the reason why my school changed the book after this semester."
0,kids 10pack,Really poor quality video....but did not pay alot would not reccomend to anyone...but its ok wont buy cheaper dvds again
1,At Last!,"At last there is a sensible way to store the jungle of plushies! This product is mandatory for households with children. Toybox space is left free for playtoys, while plushies hang in view. It's easy to take one or two down for play and return them to the chain at clean-up time. Thank You for this product!"
0,How did it happen?,"Well.. This record were as far from the word quality you can come. The movie was so great. Then how did the album get so bad? Basicly Mychael Danna have three loops. One indian style, one screaming turkish guy and one set of drums. Then he makes this fuzzy, disgusting soup outof it. 50 minutes of a turk in pains.. I'm ashamed because i bought this record. But, if you didn't like the movie. You might just have the bad taste it takes to like this album"
1,Spunky and original...,"This CD from Shakira is really great. Most of the songs, with a few exceptions, are catchy, spunky and original. Although her lyrics in English are occasionally a bit awkward (for instance, ""Whenever, Wherever"" sounds much better in Spanish) this is understandable given that it is very difficult to translate songs from Spanish to English. But the freshness and originality of most of her lyrics makes up for their awkwardness.Also, the songs are very energetic and catchy. If you are feeling upset, just turn on the first song, ""Objection"" - it is guaranteed to cheer you up. Additionally, as shown by ""Objection,"" Shakira does an excellent job of combining traditional latin music, like the tango, with modern rock guitar sounds. The result is a unique and original sound! Anyhow, if you don't have this CD, you are truly missing out. Get it soon, and enjoy!"
0,Bad...,This album suck like a PoP Mc Hammer album but with electric guitard and a real drum. Get your copy..... and put that crap in the garbage!
0,I hate this cordless desktop,"Today the button work, then tomorrow they decide not to, I have updated the software and I still have the same problem on 2 PCs, also the feel is not like that of a corded mouse, I spent $69 and I am not pleased, they just better send me my rebate back or else, if any one knows of a better unit please let me know."
0,CD Player broken within 6 months,"I agree with the other reviewers. It has alot of nice features, but the CD player stopped working (same clicking noise when you try to open or close the mechanical door - returned to the store and noticed their display model was doing the same thing). Antenna in the power code is insufficient for use in interior rooms. Don't waste your money. Displays time incorrectly after 6 months use."
0,"Academic, Not Practical","This book is good for academics that need a history of focus groups and a summary of research studies that investigate the technique itself. This is an interesting history, with many studies weighing in on what makes focus groups better or worse. But, as a practitioner, there is little that I found particularly new or insightful in the book. I think that Stewart's work is a better guide for someone that needs details on how to conduct a focus group. So, while good for PhD students, this book I found less good for managers."
0,Preview covered it all,The preview covered every possible point you might like about this movie. It was a waste of money. Thank goodness I didn't see it at the theaters. Ugh.
1,Timely and Spiritual - Beautiful,"This movie is a rather hokey making of the story of St. Francis of Assisi. Having said that I must say I found it beautiful and moving beyond belief. However, I was so moved I bought 7 more copies and gave them to my family and only one person thought of the movie as did I. If you are not a person inclined to believe that people can connect to an unseen world for spiritual reasons, then you will not get anything out of this movie. However if you are such a person you will be greatly moved. I very much recommend this movie. The songs by Donovan are again hokey but fit perfectly into this movie."
1,One Word: Terrific,"This book was a stocking stuffer at Christmas. I had never read or even heard of Benjamin Hoff before then.Intrigued by the concept of Taoism being explained with the help of Pooh and other companions from the Hundred Acre Woods, I started reading this a week after Christmas. I had finished it by next afternoon. This is such a remarkably wonderful book; deep and simple at the same time. It left me thoroughly enthralled, and I have already reread it thrice.I'd highly recommend this book!"
1,Works well,This is the best product out there for cats. It is effective and is safe for the cats. Watch the cheaper products--they could be harmful to your pets and ineffective.
0,Not for Windows 98se,"Even though the box says this adapter will work with windows 98se, don't count on it. After 15+ hours of trying various fixes and having Linksys support tell me that it does not work with windows 98, I exchanged it for a Belkin adapter (Part # F5D7010). Inserted the Belkin setup CD, it did it's thing for about 10 minutes then said to install the card. It worked right off, and was able to detect wireless networks from nearly a block away. Definitely the choice for older windows laptops!"
0,Terrible! Terrible! Terrible!,"These bags leak! I've purchased at least 4 boxes, and all of them have had leaky bags. Some leak upon defrosting, and some leak right from the start. I've switched to Lansinoh bags, because these Gerber Seal N Go bags are such a huge disappointment from an otherwise reliable baby product company."
0,Not DVI Gear and Not 1.3 Certified,"Bought 2 cables and neither worked in 2 different new LCD TV's. I contacted DVI Gear directly only to find out that they do not make these cables (DVI Gear cables are blue) and all their cables are 1.3 certified. If your TV requires 1.3 certified HDMI cables, don't buy these. They won't work."
1,GREAT product ESPECIALLY at this price,"We bought TWO of these they were so good. Only took a couple of minutes to ""dial them in"" to the right frequency and then they gave CRYSTAL CLEAR sound. Perfect solution to teenagers staying up late watching TV and keeping working dad awake 8-) Also work great while working out on Precor (eliptical trainer) and watching DirecTV in HD or listening to CD quality DirecTV music. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
0,What My Husband Doesn't Know,I started watching the movie and it was so bad I didn't continue. The acting was not good at all.
0,More of a Reference than an Instructional Text,"This book reads like a beginner's CRC Handbook. Concepts are only briefly explained with some derivation of equations and definition of the variables. Examples are useless for students that need to see an actual calculation to do problems since most read like mathematical proofs. Yes, the problems are good.....but they'd be better if the text supported their difficuly, in which a good 90% dive into concepts that students have not encountered in the reading.Lectures are short and most are taught by individuals that could care less about intro physics students, so the student must learn a bulk of the course outside of the classroom. This can't be done with this empty, pompus, overly technical book."
0,repeat of same thing,"i was very disappointed with the great chase and think quick ,the geeat chase is a repeat of where in time is carmen sandiego"
0,Pain & Passion : A Psychoanalyst Explores the World of S & M,"I was hoping this book would be a little more about the Psychoanalytical theories involved in BDSM but instead this book is simple a series of interviews. Some of the interviews are interesting tibbits into small section of the BDSM world, mainly the working aspect of BDSM. I am not impressed by the selection of people who he choose to interview, and frankly don't think it reflects the life style. It does provide some insight into the life Domme who does it as a job, which manages to redeem it into having some value. Unless you are researching BDSM you really don't have a need to buy this book."
0,HORRIBLE PHONE,ok i got this phone in october i thot it waz great at 1st every1 loved it cuz it looked so cool. but then in March it started where u cldnt hear anythin from the other person. so we sent that one bac and i got a new 1 well now well actually yesterday it did the same thing so we took the cover off and looked at it this time and we saw the wire came on the platform so we were tryin to fix it but nuttin worked and he ended up breakin the other wire so now im prolly goin to hav to get another phone and i know now that just because it looks cool doesnt mean it will b a good phone
0,No more Chamberlain!,"When will people realize how overrated Chamberlain really is? The book does a fair job of describing a moderately interesting man, but his place is the Civil War is consistantly over-emphasized. Just once I'd like to see a little attention paid to someone important like Meade."
1,Sexy and intense!!!,There were many exciting scenes the best of which was probably the Nanette major shower scene. This review lives up to Playboys professional standards and even beyond. The only thing it was missing was Shannon Tweed-older but still beautiful. I have nothing really critical to say of this DVD.
1,A thrilling finale,"Not as good as the second, but a great film nonetheless. The ending will satisfy for those looking for a happy epilogue while still being plausible."
0,Tired out,"There is nothing new under the sun with Bertice Small. Maybe her sex scenes are a little less spicy than in her past work, but that's about it. This book is like a weak repeat of Bertice Small's past work.I really disliked the ending - I don't like the fact that there's going to be a sequel to ROSAMUND hitting me on the head! I presume Logan Hepburn will be the hero of the second installment, which is nice, but do I want to buy the second installment?? Not if it reads like this one."
1,Keep It Simple,"After a disappointing 'Big Wide Grin' this album is a return to form, but it is getting a little formulaic. It has his usual Robert Johnson influenced playing and great vocals. This album has some great blues and is very laid back. Despite some of his earlier albums being a touch better this is still a great place to start if your new to Keb Mo, or even if you're new to blues.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."

1,Good and Cheap as well,Excellent shampoo ordered and first purchased by our vet at $4 moreIt helped our bichon get rid of a bad skin dryness issue
1,Wrong size,"Fast service, good price, item Was to large around. Did not fit my baffle. But made it work. Would order again, but would call to get correct bulb. ;)"
0,disappointing,"We had high hopes for this toy. It spit out a few bubbles, and then didn't spit out anymore. We went through the trouble shooting part of the instructions, and got a few more bubbles, but since the initial day of play (my son's birthday) we have been unable to generate ANY bubbles from this ""bubble mower"". As I spoke to other parents, they say the same thing, that the mower worked once and then NEVER AGAIN. He loves to push it though bubbles or no bubbles. At this point bubbles would be a surprise as I don't think he even knows it is or was supposed to be a bubble mower."
0,This game is bogus,"I couldn't get it loaded on my old machine as it wasn't fast enough. My new machine is certainly fast enough, has more than enough RAM, exceeds all requirements, but this game won't load if you run Windows xp. I had tried it a few times on my husband's computer before he upgraded to xp, and it was hard to understand how to use the characters. I have watched every episode of ""Survivor"" ever televised, I bought this game after Australian Outback, and there were supposed to be upgrades that don't exist - the website referred to doesn't exist."
0,basic electronic with no tango at all,"silly record, basic stuff on the electronic side and there's no tango at all, no songs. better listen to gotan project: it's no quite good but at least it happened first. boring and selfish record."
1,Great Game!,I loves this game! The graphics are amazing and there is great gameplay. The mystery is very intruging and mysterious. It was my first real puzzle-adventure game. I completely fell in love with it. I was on the computer for more than 5 hours at a time! I love puzzle games now and I am hoked. I recommend this game to anyone that loves adventure games and you will love it!
1,Great start for London boys,"Taking advantage of the hype for bands who names star with the, the Libertines apear onto the british music sence reminding us of such bands as the Strokes and The Hives. With thier retro styles and worn out jeans and heavy chords. The album is a promising as the first two singles of it. Up The Bracket and Time for Heros. Two amazing tunes. Virtigo is great song to start the album. Also amazing bonus track What A Waster. This song is a true English songs, using the typical British curse words such a ... and so on. over all a trully great album for someone who likes all the other bands such as the strokes, the whitestripes, the vines, the hives, and so on. They are a promising young act with loads of potential. They have a bright future."
0,Better conversation starter than function,"I am skeptical about all these gadgets shown on TV, but this one was priced where it just seemed worth trying out. I do think it creates more conversation than cooling.The weakness of this unit? The unit has to be pointed directly at the sun. I figured if the sun was within about 45 degrees from either side of direct sunlight, the unit would power up the fan, but it does not.What I found works better for me is leaving the windows down just a quarter inch and having a side window vent on the vehicle. Side Window vents are perfect for protecting the vehicle from an unexpected shower while parked and also conceal that your windows are slightly opened. They also reduce road noise when the windows are closed, but you can also vent your car while driving when it is raining out too.Lastly, it doesn't slice and dice. Okay, not all TV gadgets slice and dice.Pretty neat idea, just needs more solar panels that are directed in more directions."
0,Free and Clear shampoo,I was disappointed. Refreshing tingle and smell but left a residue on my scalp --- the opposite of what I expected.
1,what fun,This is a hoot of a read - it was sent to me by girlfriends who listened to the audio version on a road trip. They were still laughing.
0,Oh my God........I think I'm now deaf,"This album blows. I probably have severe hearing problems thanks to Ashanti's horrible writting skills. She is a nice person, but this CD is garbage. A CD that's good? ---> Monica's ""After the Storm"" (Plus all the tracks from her unreleased ""All Eyez On Me"" or Beyonce's ""Dangerously in Love"")"
1,A timely perspective,"This book has been used by a morning study group with great success. Father Rohr provides excellent discussion themes and realistic (new) ways to obtain win-win results.St. Francis is a needed role model in today's time of fear and retribution.I highly recommend this book to anyone -- red or blue. In fact, it should be required reading!"
0,not very good,"As a fan of The Oak Island Mystery, I book this book on the spot. When the authors talk about Oak Island, the book moves along. But, when they start going off on their own theories, you seem to get lost easily. Their claim "" ...have finally solved the sinister riddle of Oak Island...."" is the farthest thing from the truth. I'm sorry I wasted my money on this book."
0,Third time is not a charm,"This is the third set of ""History of the title"" dvds. But although the cover is cool the dvd is less than epic.The documentary on the history of the world title is more like a history of wrestling which isn't bad to watch honestly, but the world championship is more talked about in the last 10 minutes of the documentary.The match selection was also not the best. It does have a couple of great matches that some people may have forgotten along the way. Undertaker vs. Kurt Angle at No Way Out (which they were actually trying to get for Wrestlemania 22) was great and John Cena vs. Chris Jericho at Survivor Series 2008, a few good matches, but not enough to get the dvd. The rest of the matches are random and forgettable."

I checked it to see if it was leaking and I went to bed ... I got up in the morning and all the water leaked out all over the floor... could have been a very dangerous situation...
1,Everyone who cares about our troops should see this.,Many of our returning military are in trouble and have difficulties that are very evident but difficult for us to understand. This movies gives real insights into the origins of those problems and allows those of us who care to find ways to help.
1,"Finally, this one does it all!","I am a mom of 3 children and my two youngest absolutely LOVE this DVD. My kids actually pull this DVD out of our large stack of other videos and DVD's as their favorite. I love the music (all the oldies -- you already know most of the words but if you need it, it comes with the lyrics) and we all sing and dance together. It's just like having a Mommy and Me playgroup right at home -- the activities are great!! Can't say enough about this, it's a must have for you moms (or dads) out there."
1,Great little answering machine,"Pretty easy to set up (definitely read the instructions), decent sound quality, inexpensive, and easy to operate. Exactly what I wanted."
0,cute but not very good,"It looks cute, but the cute-factor no longer soothes my irritation when this product turns what should be a simple matter of slicing an egg into an ordeal. The product is difficult to clean and the metal wires just don't have enough tension in them to be able to cut the egg properly - they get pushed out of the way and seem so flimsy that I am amazed they have not snapped yet."
1,Does what it says.,"I have a 100 ft electric cord (14 gauge) that want to keep it organized. This worked very well. First I had to unwind the whole cord and fold it so both female and male outlets are at one end. Started winding from another end. So when I release the wire, both male end and female end gets un-winded.I wish there is a lock of some sought to the reel. When you are using it tends to turn and loosens the wire. When it is time to wind the cord, you got to tighten the loose wire before you wind it.On the whole, I like the product. I will recommend it."
1,Excellent hands on guide...,"I bought this guide not knowing much about the Gimp and was pleasantly surprised. It covers the interface to start and does so in a way that gets you immediately using the Gimp. It also covers such things as photo retouching, drawing, painting, textures, creating advertising pieces and interfaces (i.e. for media players), graphics for the web (buttons, navigation, etc),web page layouts and the use of filters as tools.All this is covered in a relaxed, fun and practical style. If you want more than just a list of commands and want to UNDERSTAND why you do something, then this is the book for you.Highly recommended!"

1,I don't know why.,"When Mick Taylor participates in a record there is always a special touch in it. As a Rolling Stones fan, the period with Taylor was special. I don't know why the second record with Herbie Mann was never published in cd format. This is a way to make disappear music. I am talking about REGGAE II, where Mick Taylor appears too."
1,great unit,"Great unit, I constantly find uses for it. As someone else pointed out, the dust collection port isnt useful since you cant really hook anything up to it... Also, my power switch is a bit sensitive, you have to find that sweet spot to get it going... Other than that, great little unit."
1,The Book everyone must read.,"It is not a fantasy book. It is not a book that you read just for fun. This a book of lore, where everyone can find answers to all questions. This book gives you clear understanding of what is good and what is evil. Actually, it was not written by Tolkien - he just translated it fron The Red Book of Westmarch, the Cronicles of the Shire and the Middle-earth. Have you ever wondered how a small weak creture can change world's history? Read this book, which is just a foreword to the great epic of 'The Lord of the Rings' and'Silmarillion'"

0,You get what you pay for,"My son had a problem with his phone (not related to the battery) shortly after getting this battery. While checking out the phone, the Cellcom tech immediately noticed something fishy about the battery. He noticed it was bulging slightly and questioned where the battery came from. He said the cells inside were coming apart or something like that and this is what was causing the case to bulge. He ended up needing a new phone so I will never know how long this battery would have lasted. Either way, it's money down the drain."
0,Missing Text (No Subtitles or Closed Captions),"For the life of me, I do not understand this! NO CLOSED CAPTIONS OR SUBTITLES!You can watch this movie on PBS in Closed Captions (that is those pop up subtitles on the TV Screen). On the VHS, it is in Closed Captions. But on the DVD, it has none! Why make a DVD and take away features that was on the VHS? I have written to the Sullivan Studio. Of course, they never replied to my letters.I just hope that they will smarten up and get these feature in the future DVD update."

1,An exquisite must-have recording,"This is my first CD review on Amazon but I had to recommend this album as one of the most beautiful I have ever listened to. [My musical tastes run from medieval plainchant to show music.] Hilary Hahn has incredible talent - I have followed her career ever since hearing an NPR interview when she was 13. Her violin playing becomes more lovely with each recording (this is no. 3). The two works on this CD are lyrical, evocative and very American. The Meyer, in particular, has themes of folk melodies and is reminiscent of Copland. Meyer wrote this piece for Hilary Hahn and the work and her playing are stunning. This is a recording to listen to over and over again."

0,Tastes like dog food,"A relative gave this to our household. It looks and tastes like dog food. Smells like it to. Since chicken alfredo is my favorite food I have tasted many during my lifetime. And this is the worst one I have ever tasted. It's as if a shipment of animal products and human food got mixed up, and it LOOKS like our dog's meals. I ended up giving the rest to him and he lapped it up. I would not buy this for humans."

1,Love this necklace!,"This is my 3rd starfish necklace - the 1st two I ordered directly through the company and then I decided to order this one through Amazon (first 2 broke within a few months). Essentially, it's the same ""charm"" but the necklace from Amazon is a MUCH better quality necklace. I've never cleaned it and wear it all the time and it always looks shiny - I get a lot of compliments on it!"
1,"""The Dust Factory""","A very imaginative fantasy, with a lot of appeal to all young and/or young at heart. I saw the movie presented of TV and decided it was worthy adding to our collection of mostly classic movie DVD's. The plot is easy to follow - but for you to find out if you should chose to buy this DVD. Suffices to say that, in all probablity, you will not be disappointed."

Two bonus songs, that the album is featured with, are rhythmically really beautiful songs! Ne Cedez Jamais, translated as a ""Never Give Up"", and Les Enfants Perdus - ""Lost Children"", are worth to buy the whole album, even you've already bought original ""Black ivory Soul""! You won't be upset!In this album Kidjo shows her as usually superb and vocally strong voice!:)"

0,Anti-Catholic odor,"Written by an excommunicated priest, this book is not about the Church and the Jews. It is about the religious agenda of a bitter refugee from the sexual bacchanale of the sixties.Rather than opposing prejudice, it is awash in prejudice.It appeals to every anti-Catholic myth of the last decades. It even manages to be anti-Semitic. He claims that Jews should drop their claim to be God's chosen people.What's left?"
0,Very unimpressed,"Wow...I saw all the good reviews and was expecting an amazing blade...boy was I wrong. The thing did cut quickly and easily but when I looked at the edge of the board it was TERRIBLE! I would have to joint the board 1/16"" to get rid of all the marks it left.I am sure that my table saw is adjusted properly cause I just checked it with a dial indicator. I also look at the results I get from my Ridgid combination blade, which are like glass. The Freud is almost like what you get from a bandsaw blade but with burn marks to boot!Maybe this blade needs a stabilizer to work properly, but I'm not going to buy one to find out if I can return this."
0,Starts okay but then....,"The book started out fine. I liked the first half - then it was boring, badly written, and way too self indulgent. I too bought it based on the comments on the front and back cover and thought a NY Times book reviewer probably knew what a good book was. The last half needed to be much shorter - somewhat of a clever idea but didn't quite work in reality."
1,An extraordinary gift!,"I bought this book after reading a review someplace else and was so glad I did. It's just a lot of fun to read, in fact, I've found that since I finished it I'll pick it up and flip through it because it always brings a smile to my face. It's full of ordinary things from the author's life, but it's those simple, every day things we can identify with that makes it so fun. And while it looks like it's a book for young women, I think it can be enjoyed by men as well as readers of any age. It also makes a wonderful gift, especially for hard-to-shop for people on your list."
1,EXCELENT COMEDY !!!,"GREAT MOVIE TO SPEND A NICE RELAXIN TIME :) GREAT ACTORS, GOOD STORY AND VERY FUNY !!!"
1,Hack and Slash Fun,"Sacred: Gold is your typical point-click-kill hack and slash, but it's very fun and addictive and has a lot of variety. There are many different types of characters to choose from and the game play is pretty smooth, though it can be glitchy at times. I'd recommend that you save often, as this game is known to crash unexpectedly. Other than that, I have no complaints, for the price, you can't get a better game of it's type."
0,"Not really chocolate, just sugar milk",You can barely taste the chocolate in this drink because the sweetness is so overwhelming!!! Somewhat nauseating really
0,Too Bad I Can't Rate it Zero Stars,"This has to be the most over-hyped piece of bad writing in a long while. The characters are unbelievably dull and naive, prone to coming to brilliant deductions 80 pages after the reader has figured it all out. Speaking of characters, there are too many of them who just fill up the pages and don't add to the story. I didn't think much of the vaunted research either. I'm no Dracula scholar, but I didn't read anything in this book that I hadn't come across in reviews of old Christopher Lee movies.The only good news in this is that it took Kostova 10 years to write the book. Maybe we'll have 10 years of peace before she finishes another one. Let me guess: Dracula resurfaces in Philadelphia and ...."

0,Chore,"If you are going to be designing mega-websites, like Amazon.com, (The author uses Amazon.com as an example), or if you are in a mega-corporation with a dedicated team assigned the task of setting up a web site, this book is for you. If you like the esoteric debates on the merits of internet/web design along the lines of Jacob Nielson, or Patrick Lynch, then this book is for you, (although this author does not come across as iconoclastic in her views as the previous authors). Are these the only audiences for this book? No, I am sure anyone involved in designing web sites can find something of value in these pages, if you can stick with it. I found the writing style to be very dry, making reading this text a chore."

1,Wish the carafe was heavier glass but a good coffee maker,"This makes great coffee in a hurry. I like the timer, so I can wake up to it already brewed. My big complaint about this and ALL coffee makers is how thin the glass is. I had to buy a replacement carafe within weeks of purchasing the original one because I accidentally tapped it against the side of my solid surface counter top and it broke. I'd use a metal carafe but none fit. No big deal. I like the red color and it's lasted a lot longer than others I've had in the past, so I can't complain."

1,Memory Stick Was Outstanding!,"The memory stick was exactly what was described, it arrived on time and was half the price of other dealers in town. Excellent price and delivery."
0,Pure Trash,"I'll admit that I read this book coming off of reading David Copperfield; however, reading this book was PURE AGONY! The characters are cardboard, the plot is hackneyed and the violence is gratuitous. At only one place did the book bacome even moderately human, and even that part was spoiled by the author's twisting it back into the main (thin) plot. If you believe that this Jack Reacher guy is anything like the stereotype of a John Wayne character, forget it. Again, the plot is poorly contrived, the characters are cardboard and the writing is terrible. I would be hard pressed to purchase another Lee Child book!"

1,Psychologically sound,"I'm not a psychology major, so I was a little anxious when I signed up for Abnormal psych (a pre-requisite for the Nursing curriculum). My nervousness was soon allayed after reading the first few pages. The writing style is easy to read, with all the important terms and concepts in the bold print that professeurs love to put on tests. Halgin and Whitbourne even try to make it a little interesting by placing ""Mini Case Studies"" throughout the chapters to display theory application. A definite addition to a beginning psychologist's collection."
0,Not very good and horribly dated,"Half of the chainsaw EP that's included as bonus tracks are probably the best thing about this cd, which saddens me. There's not a song on here I can really sit through because most of the tracks are repatative and abrasive without being very interesting. At times I expect them to break out into the Miami Vice Theme Song due to some of the samples and instruments used. The followup, Cleanse Fold and Manipulate, is much MUCH better than this."
0,Not all it is cracked up to be,"While I agree that if Tolkien had not written this series, fantasy would not be what it is today, overall I was bored with the story. I would advise for those that want to study the history of literature, to read these books. But for those that would like action and excitement... move along. It was a difficult journey to make reading ""The Lord of Rings"", many fine people and creatures were met and their images and personalities will be remembered. I will even go so far as to say that some friends were made. However...even sometimes we get bored hanging out with our friends."
0,Not My Weezer,"Maladroit is a good CD in its own right, however, for a Weezer CD it's just not that great. The Weezer I know is the Weezer of the Blue Album and Pinkerton. Their new form of poppy punk powerchord rock is just not what I fell in love with so many years ago with the Blue album. I think most die hard weezer fans would agree with me in the fact that Weezer really isn't as awesome as they once were. This CD is good, but it's not my Weezer."
1,My Favorite Sonic Youth CD,"For all the attention Daydream Nation and EVOL get, I think Sonic Youth's best stuff, by far, is from the 90s. Exp...is outstanding and this is better. ""The Diamond Sea"" is without a doubt the best Sonic Youth song, and ""No Queen Blues"" is the second best. Anyway, buy this and listen to it."
0,The only thing my eyes were doing was fighting to stay open,"I and the entire row of people that saw this movie were bored out of our minds. I actually fell asleep at one point. The charactors were unlikeable. The plot was unfathomable. The ""point"" was missing. And, the story was plain, old boring. I agree with some of the other reviews - rent before you buy or you might be sorry."

1,It couldn't fail,"With the combination of Marc Heal (Cubanate) and Jean-Luc De Meyer (Front 242, Cobalt 60) this album couldn't be bad. While some tracks (Silent Voices) aren't to good the vast majority are. All my complaints about the album erode away when I listen to Flowing, Foetal, or The Lost. It's a great album which fans of Marc, Jean-Luc or industrial dance in general shouldn't miss."
0,ZEN MALFUNCTIONS A LOT!,"I'd rate the Zen Micro 0 stars, but it isn't available. I used to like this player; it was cheaper and smaller than a regular Ipod. The first problem I had was the headphone jack. I had to send it out to get fixed. As soon as I got it back it worked okay. A couple of days later, I noticed that it kept freezing on me. I had to open up the back and take the battery out almost every time I turned on the player.All I have had was problem after problem with this mp3 player and the customer service sucks! They charge you for the call and then refund you if you have to send your creative product back to them for repair.DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!!!"

1,Nice movie....,"I was scared after many people wrote not very good things about this movie. Its maybe not the best movie but interesting and entertaining. With my snake-phobia I was shocked at one scene.The movie beginns mysterious, Anthony Perkins character enter in a mysterious world, a mysterious forest (and the jungle can be very mysterious).I enjoyed very much the movie. The art decors / jungle looks great. Henry Silva is perfect for his role and also I liked Anthony Perkins (at this time 27 years, 3 years younger than his Co-Star Audrey Hepburn).The DVDThe picture quality looks very good. So much better than I have expected for a not restored/remastered movie!The Sound: very good too in STEREO - Bronislau Kapers score sounds great.The only one and biggest MINUS point I have: NO SUBTITLES for deaf hearing people, so its a little bit difficult for me to understand every word.TRIVIA: this was the first Hollywood movie shot in PANANVISION!!!"
1,A Painter with a View,"Susan Bennerstrom's work is deceptively simple and pleasing, but as you peel away the gorgeous colors and ubiquitous lines, you'll find a rich, complex emotional life. Could it be that Ms.Bennerstrom has wrapped her glorious vision of the world in seductive shapes and colors so that we'll come inside and experience it with her?This book is just as inviting as Bennerstrom's paintings and contains rare insight into her work. For example, I would not have guessed at Bennerstrom's influences--Italian painters of the 20's and 30's. The writers of this book have made me curious them, too.It is rare to be given a perspective on a painter who is in the midst of producing her best work. Hopefully, there will be future editions of this book that will keep up updated on Ms. Bennerstrom's world view."
1,Hot Coffee!!,"I was totally tired of lukewarm coffee from various drip pots I have had--some of the best brands, but I always had to warm my cup in the microwave. With this percolator, I set the timer and have hot coffee waiting when we are ready for breakfast. When lifted from the base it is cordless for serving! Best pot I've ever had!"
1,Oustanding Performance,"This product is great, it removes those ugly hairs you can't reach with a regular shaver.It charges for a long time, you can also bring it with you any where you go, the coolest part is that it fits in any purse, bag or bagpack. I guarantee you'll be satisfy, I know I am."
1,"Old, out of date, but hey that's me too.","I read this (at least some of it) in 1973 before traveling with a friend to Europe, Middle East, Far East. It gave me great comfort then that I (we) could do so cheaply and quickly.Now Ed's book is more of a history of 60s vagabonding than a practical guide for today's traveller, but fun reading and don't let that stop you from buying it and getting the Vagabonding Bug... Travel On!A wonderful read if you're going to Europe or New Jersey!"
0,Backrest poorly designed,"I was looking for a lightweight chair to take backpacking. I am very disappointed in the backrest on this model. It is way too far back to be useful. I am working on jamming something next to the pivot to provide more support. Too bad, because the design is so simple and light."
1,Our Moravian Hymn Heritage,"It's dense! Rev. Adams gives you a lesson in meter, rythm and rhyme. Then he talks about how different translators can change a hymn. He spent years researching in the Moravian Archives in Bethlehem, PA, in order to write this book. He even audited German class at Moravian College to brush up his German. Meticulous research as to which tunes are of ""true Moravian"" heritage or borrowed from other sources. Not dynamically written, but chock full of history."
0,It's OK,I've always liked the Rolex style but never wanted to pay the Rolex price. Found this at a discount and went for it. It's light and doesn't feel very sturdy. As such I didn't trust it could hold up as well as my REACTOR or Timex Ironman so I returned it. This might be a good starter for a young man but I wouldn't put it in as grown-up watch collection.
1,Like it a lot!,I have wanted to own this movie for some time. Very happy! That little girl can sing!!!
0,Falls Apart,I agree with other reviewers - this toy is a piece of junk. Spend more and get something that works!
0,The PICTURE of the Item I purchased was not the same as what I received.,The picture with the listing of the Leatherman Wave was shown with a leather and nylon sheath which was an important reason why I ordered that particular one. It allows me to have the Leatherman on my belt sideways and it also has a pouch to hold the extra drivers that come with it. When I received my Leatherman It came with a leather sheath that will only mount upright on my belt and does not even hold the additional driver tips. I needed the tool that is why I purchased it so I don't want to half to deal with sending it back over a sheath so I will now half to order another one from somewhere so I can tack on another 10% of the cost for a new sheath.
1,Great DVD!,Peter Jackson does a wonderful job recreating Tolkein's book. The behind the scenes footage is actually interesting to watch!
1,Required Reading,This is a great resource. It was a necessary purchase for training in Yoga Therapy. An easy book to understand.
1,Pretty imaginative,"For someone so young, this first book is quite complex. So waht if the author borrowed on a theme? Most published works these days are rarely an original thought.Eragon has accomplished in one book what it took the first four of the Harry Potter series to achieve. The book introduces us to a world of innocence that is quickly overshadowed by harship, mistrust, hard-won friendships, war, and politics. I also love the sassiness of Saphira. I do love Harry Potter, but I place Eragon much closer to my first love which is the Lord of the Rings trilogy.In a world where it is so hard to get some youngsters to pick up a book, I'm glad that one had enough imagination, drive, and support to write one.I look forward to the future of Eragon."
0,Not worth buying.,"I reckon this book is James' weakest. It lacks suspense, the characters are poorly developed and the whole idea of this book is kind of ridiculous. I seem to get the impression that the author hastily wrote this book to make a quick buck."
0,An Above Average Musical-Made-Movie,"I really don't understand all the hype and praise surrounding this movie. It is nothing new-- ""Chicago"" has been around in some form or another for 70 years or so. It is pretty much like every other musical I've seen, maybe a little better than average-- Entertaining, but not something that you will look back on for years to come. Even a movie like Forrest Gump, an imperfect movie that somehow won the Oscar, is more of a classic. Rent, don't buy, with low expectations, and you might be entertained. Just don't get sucked in by ""all that jazz."""
1,daiwa long cast,I have used these reels for the past 15-20 years. I own multiple reels in all three sizes and use the 700 for trout and crappie. The 1300 for finesse and the 1600 for heavier lines and lures. I have thoughly enjoyed these reels and they have been totally trouble free.
1,not a poor old luser,"good overview of some of the standout tracks from the career of a great Christian band. definitely worth buying if you have never heard this band before. interesting vocals that may sound strange at first but you will love with time. similar to tuna fish. also good to buy if you want a good cd to listen to when driving. i would describe their sound as mellow-power-pop. oh yeah, the lyrics will knock your socks off. very deep. like a good poem that isn't depressing."
0,Don't waste your $$$ on the Nuvi 200 - Buy a TomTom One instead!,"This overpriced product suffers from an awkward interface, a dim screen, and a very limited feature set. I also find the routing capabilities far too limiting.I've traded in my 200 for a TomTom One and couldn't be more thrilled - it costs less (amazon running a blowout sale for $199), fits more easily in a pocket, and has bluetooth connectivity for handsfree calling. In addition it also has mapsharing capabilities which (theoretically) ensure that maps are constantly up to date, though I haven't had a chance to put that feature through its paces."
1,Be Mature - An excellent book!,"This book is an excellent Bible study on the book of James. I highly recommend this book, especially if you are looking for answers to questions from God's word, or desire spiritual growth. The Shipper, ChristianBookClearinghouse was very efficient and I received my order within two weeks, in good shape. Go for it! You WILL be blessed."
1,autthors you can trust,Cassandra Clair recommends these books. My granddaughters are fans of hers and they are now ready the books for the second time within one week of receiving them and will I am sure read them as many times as the Harry Potter books and that's some record
1,great music,"I love the music on the CD, and it plays well. I just wish the original CD cover had been included."
1,"Never say ""never.""","Reasonably good quality for a low price, but ""NeverKink"" is a slight exaggeration. I think shipping was free, a factor that means a big difference in price."
1,Full of twists,"I am so glad that this TV series is on DVD! I have watched every season over and over again, and it never really gets old. The snide, sarcastic remarks, the witty criticisms , and the insanely hilarious acting all make up an excellent TV show."
1,very good fiction related to Beat beginnings in San Francisc,the start of a counter-culture relationship in the Beat literature movement; author develops several main characters with quality talent; author goes beyond comtempory lit. syle to establish his own unique method
1,Enjoying this again and again,"There are certainly better qualified Beatles fans to get a review from, however, I must say I am enjoying this CD. The time I've spent listening to it is no longer markable in hours. We are looking at days here now. I am not entirely sure that all the #1 hits are on here but enough are for me to enjoy the whole thing.It is also filling some gaps I have in my newly forming Beatles collection. Some of their songs it seems aren't on the albums and this CD got them in my hands and ears. That shows the value of the CD right there.Very enjoyable and highly recommended."
1,"Not perfect, but it works...","This rake seems to have a nice design and is fairly light weight. If you just use 1 extension piece it's pretty sturdy and looks like the photo on the box - a straight pole. But we were very surprised to see how much bow there is to the pole when you've got more extensions attached to it. The longer it is, the more the rake ""dips"", and it becomes pretty awkward to position it where you want it. It felt something like trying to land a great big fish with one of those old fashioned long bamboo poles!But at any rate, for us, it was still a good purchase because it allows us to reach every inch of our 1 story home's roof. (So we can drag down all the big cotton piles which accumulate from our neighbor's cottonwood tree and never seem to blow off.) I'm sure in winter it'll work great to scrape just a few feet of snow away from the edge of the roof/gutters - because we'll only need 1 extension to reach - but it's still August, we're not anxious to test that!"
0,What a disappointment......,"I got this movie for my grand-daughter, she's 8. We watched the 1hr 2min movie together. I can say that we were both very disappointed. At several points during the movie my grand-daughter said...""Paw Paw, is this a real movie?? It looks like somebody make it with a video camera"" She was right. Story's not that great either. I could not recommend this movie to anyone. How somebody gave it a 5, I don't know. Maybe they were related to the film-maker(term used loosely)."
0,Tryed everthing can't get it to work,I have tried everything and I can't get this to work. I have called the number to ask them but everytime I get put on hold and it is costing me for the phone call. Sit on hold finally get frustrated and hang up. If anyone knows how I can get it to work I am sure I would like it. Right now all it does is sit there.
0,worst tiger woods ever,it is by far the most confusing tiger woods game out there. i had no idea where to go or how to do anything on this game. i ended up selling it. horrible
1,Good Product!,"This is a good product. However, my husband has tried many products like vicerex, viapro + maxoderm Vivaxa, Zencore Plus, maxidus. They are very good product. But By far,Double V - Vazogel & Virectin Sex Enhancement COMBO is edible, orgasm-inducing, all-natural, ionized water-based gel for him and her, and 12 pills bottle that works very instantly as well. It is very powerful combination compare just pills itself alone. This is the best my husband has ever used. Awsome! You got to try it out for yourself."
0,Not worth buying this product,Not worth buying this product. Almost whole book was filled with pencil n had to erase it which took couple of hours.
0,Do not buy!!,This movie is ok however the blue ray disk sucks!!! This companies keep making discs that won't play on Power DVD version 8 and prompt you to buy version 9 so they can make more $$. [...]I have Music CD's and I can play 10 years old cd on any CD player and they play. Now with this Blu Ray disk you have to keep updating the software or it won't play. It will play on the Sony PS3 made by Sony but not on your computer even if you have Power DVD. This really sucks!!I won't to blog sites and a lot of people are having the same problem with this movie. It starts but there is no menu to play the movie so you can not see it.This companies sould get a class action suit so they can start making products that you can use in any Blue ray player.
0,I do not recommend this book,"I was looking for specific advice about ""how to shoot"" my kid (photographically). I did not get it. This book REALLY IS just a photo album of the author's own kids. While some people may be able to infer how to achieve great photos of their kids by looking at Mr. Elgort's photos, I needed more ""how to"" instruction. There is very little text in this book at all and I felt the title was misleading. If you are looking for excellent instruction on how to photograph your children (babies in particular) buy HOW TO PHOTOGRAPH YOUR BABY by Nick Kelsh, a far superior book which I bought after trashing this one."
0,What a disappointment,"Whilst Loretta Young unquestionably lead an interesting life, you would not know it from this whitewashed, saintly version. This book would have been far better promoted as a commentary on Loretta Young and her relationship with god. Certainly those readers wanting to know about her experiences in Hollywood in the 1930s would be disappointed. Her screen career was largely glossed over - we are talking about a woman who worked with pioneers such as Lon Chaney - you'd barely know it from this book. Similarly, there was little on her relationship with her sisters or any comments of substance about their lives or careers. Even the more 'scandalous' elements of her life were only worth a couple of pages - the rest of the book was more like a conversion exercise. Whilst the religious element was obviously something that influenced who she was as a person, the author did not delve beyond this. It is an injustice if this is the best that can be offered in her memory."
1,"Exactly ""as advertised"". Useful.","The National Parks are great, and they get all the glory, but it will repay you to visit some of the excellent state parks of the Southwest. This book gives the critical information to do so--How to get there, sketch maps of important routes and sites in each park, and brief summaries of the human and/or natural history that caused each park to be established. Recommended."
0,Boring Made-For-TV Movie,"The only thing that made this film worthwhile is Rick Schroder's nude skinnydipping scene. He undresses in front of the lake, revealing his impressive ass, and then another great ass shot as he surfaces, the water running over his round, wholesome cheeks. This is the only reason I gave the film 2 stars, other than that it's a boring waste of time. You're better off reading James Michner's book."
1,Chill Comp,"I enjoyed this CD. It has some very rare tracks, and if you're a Ministry of Sound or Euphoria fan, you'll be a bit interested in hearing where some of the DJ's inspiration seems to come from. For example, the track by ""Chant"" was redone and made countless times and is probably more commonly known because of the DJ ""Chicane"", who sampled the track in ""Saltwater"". If you've heard that track, Chicane's version, and enjoyed the ambient version of it, you'll more than appreciate the original of the song. It's fantastic and far superior.But that's the sort of cd that this is. More along the lines of a ""Euphoria Chilled Out"" meets ""Break N Bossa"" sort of thing with a hint of Arabic and Indie ambiance in between. Hard to describe - judging from what I've seen of the Buddha Bar series, I'd say they're pretty close. I'd recommend this one."
0,Don't Torture Youself,This is by far and away the worst Triple Crown book ever. I don't know how a book can be published with words like open being mispelled. The book was double spaced which I really don't understand and I found that truly distracting. From page one I knew I wasn't going to like the book. But I was very bored and finished it anyway in 3 hours. The writing style is so simple it seems like its for a person in grammar school. There was no real plot. No interesting characters. And an another major problem the book would talk about Detective so and so for seven pages and the next paragraph it would switch to another character's perspective. There was no transitioning between different characters stories. The ending was stupid. Surprising but stupid. Please don't waste 15 dollars and I wouldn't even recommend borrowing it from the library. This is the worst Triple Crown book ever.
0,Misappropriate title will disappoint all readers,"This book is a poor attempt by the author to share his insight during a tour on a fast attack submarine. Written on the level of at best a fifth grader, it embarrasses anyone wearing dolphins, and to those not wearing them, makes the dolphin wearing community appear as dolts. On every submarine there are some individuals that stand out as""shit-birds"". These are normally new kids who know everything, and don't realize that among the crew, nothing is sacred, and no personal secret is safe during the long boring watches stood from the Ballast Control Panel (BCP) in control, to the engine room rover. This book places the author squarely in this category, as someone who ran the sub by himself from maneuvering"
1,Really Swings,"The bottom line is that every song here swings. On top of that, the voices blend together beautifully, each of the three are excellent singers, and John Hendricks' lyrics are very clever. Just listen to ""Caravan"", ""Cloudburst"", or ""Centerpiece"". I highly recomend this CD."
1,Boys Life,Got for 7 1/2 yr old nephew. He LOVES it!! Can hardly wait for each issue & re-reads every one. Great buy!
0,Highly Disappointing,"I was highly disappointed when I began playing this game. It lacks many of the things that made the PC game so appealing. I have the PC game and throughly enjoy it but I think Maxis struck out with this version. The controls are difficult to get used to and the game doesn't have a lot of variety. There aren't a lot of skin choices, or a lot of things to buy. However, I do like the feature that you are allowed to build and furnish a house on the lot before you move a family in. This is an option not available in the PC game. I wouldn't recommend this to any of the PC games fans for the mere fact that it just doesn't even begin to measure up."
0,boring,"It is suggested that devotees of Tolkien will be offended by this parody. I wasn't offended, just bored. My advice is to save your money."
0,"If you can stomach the pasty and stiff Rose, Jimmy Buffett's interview is a good collector piece for Parrotheads...","I like Jimmy Buffett's interview here butRose is a pretty sorry establishment/Int-erviewer/Hack.

1,No Problem with Windows 2000 Professional,"I wrote this review in response to another review about the ""problem with Windows 2000 Pro"". I had this IOGEAR GHE135U enclosure with my old hard drive (ATA66) with Windows 2000 Pro SP3, it has no problem at all. The Windows 2000 found it and installed it as ""Disk Drive"" at very first time when connecting it. About this, it is also clearly stated at its manual...""no driver need for ME, 2000, XP"". The only thing I don't like is the extra external power adapter; however, I beleive it is a must in order to provide the extra voltages for the regular hard drive (12 Volt/5 Volt). I like the big switch in the front panel, which allow me to just turn if off (after I 'Stop' it at the OS) without need to unplug it."
1,This Guy Does Good Pictures! (so said one of the kids),"and Mom agrees!Mr. George and the Red hat is a beautiful book! The illustrations are delightful. You really can imagine yourself among the sun-dappled trees in the park. The scenery is touched with light and soft detail. The colors are rich and warm. You can see the texture of the canvas in the pictures.The story is equally charming. Mr. George is the neighborhood squirrel. Maybe he lives in your park. One day he finds a red felt doll hat. He imagines which animal it belongs to, a chipmunk perhaps? He finally decides the hat is perfect for him and for helping him collect nuts. The other park animals admire Mr. George and his wonderful hat. In a generous act of kindness, he offers his hat to a young mother bird that needs a home for her babies. It's a perfect new home!You will just have to wonder if the squirrel you see in the park is Mr. George the generous squirrel."

0,Disappointing Follow Up to Volume 1,"If you got Dance Essentials, volume 1 and expected the second rendition to rival it, you will be sorely disappointed. This CD lacks the energy and constant ""up"" of volume 1. I have listened to volume 1 over and over and over ad nauseum, and STILL, I smile every time I hear it. I found myself jumping ahead to the next song on volume 2 due to the monotonous rhythm and lack of interesting vocals or accompaniment. What a disappointment. I will surely not RUSH to get volume 3.Too bummed ..."
0,george adamski,"Be aware of the fake alien cults.I suspect, George Adamski, was apart of some kind of undercover nazi/russian project. I saw one of these ships in dec 31 2009. I've reported my experience to mufon and army core of engineers.(Currently, I have been unable to read his books. I will edit my review with statements from his books; when I read them. Maybe ancient alien theory is possible. But, if the aliens are white; take it with a grain of salt.)"
0,Not quite at all!,I bought two of these. Obsolutely have no difference from the regular pump. I woundnt waste my money on this one.
1,great deal,"I loved these books. I bought this set as a gift. The larger size is easier to hold when reading, and the price is great."
0,The worst movie ever made,"Nora Ephron should be tied to a fencepost and beaten unconscious for making this drek. Look beyond the fact that this movie is one long commercial, no other film has more product placement. The insidious message of the film is the inevitability of corporate domination. Meg Ryan, the small business owner, has her bookstore driven into the ground by Tom Hanks and his Borders type mega-store but all is forgiven in the name of love. I've never known destroying someone's livelihood to be an aphrodisiac. The rest is by the numbers romantic comedy. One star is beyond generous. Trite, shallow, saccharine, completely without merit. Everyone involved should be shot!"
1,Skip the introd and the rest is good,"This is a pretty solid book. Well written, with lots of interviews and information on hacking. Not a how to book by any means...Reminds me of the Maters of Deception book from a few years back.The only draw back is a rather...err silly intro."
0,What to expect when your expecting,I cant get this movie to play so I have not seen it. It just shows its loading but never plays. Grrrr
1,Difficult but entertaining,"I bought this board from interest. When I saw the two wheels, I thought it would be impossible to ride. But I tried it and it turned out to be easy. If you lose your balance it won't slide out from under you. Instead, it will tilt to one side, which I found conveniant. I recommend this to people who enjoy skateboarding, skiing, or snowboarding"
0,another glorified graduate school project,"when i was in graduate school, we had two phrases for this genre of ""experimental"" american novel: bloated and showoffy. in those days all you had to do was write down all the adjectives you could think of before noon and pass it off as avant-garde literature. stones of summer might have been fun to read for the sheer preening self-loathing of it all if not for the fact that it takes itself so seriously. lighten up mr. mossman! and grow up. every female character is a demeaning sixties cliche. i can't believe any woman would traul through this labored adolescent boy's fantasy."
0,It doesnt install!!!,"This is an example of a large company pertpetrating fraud on the people who buy its products.I bought my son an iPod for Christmas. Unfortunately he could not use it to download from itunes on his 4 yr old Mac Powerbook computer. He needed to buy the newer (tiger) operating system. So another [...] to buy this operating system. He has been unable to install it on his Powerbook.Both of us have spent over 4 hours on the phone with Mac tech support(hah!) and have found no solution. Finally they told us to bring it in to an Applestore (three hour drive away) which we did, only to be told that it would cost [...] for them to even look at it.I hope no one else has to suffer like we have just because you bought an iPod."
1,A surprisingly great children's CD that adults will love too,"I can't stop singing these songs! This was a gift from a friend, and the music is terrific, not to mention I love the artist themes woven into good music. ""Stay Three"" is poignant for any parent, yearning for their child to remain as adorable as they are at this moment. I am off to buy some more Jessica Harper!"
0,Don't waste your money or time!,"I liked the idea of not having to lift the mattress to position the bed ruffle, but it doesn't work. Parts of the skirt ride up in between the box spring and mattress, leaving that part of the ruffle several inches off the ground. Other parts slide down on the box spring leaving the bottom dragging on the ground. It's impossible to keep the whole thing in place and equally level to the ground. I'm always tugging it down in places, or pushing it up in other places. I guess the idea is for the weight of the mattress to keep it in place, but it doesn't on my bed. Also, the material is thin and looks cheap. And it doesn't go around an entire full size bed, so you better have part of the bed against a wall. I wish I had sent it back during the 30-day return period."
1,Stellar compilation,"Discovered Queensryche's work via an adaptation of track ""Silent Lucidity"" and came away from listening to this compilation impressed by the breadth and depth of content and musical styles/techniques. As much as we all have our favourite tracks and genres from any artist's album releases, a decent 'greatest hits' should give you a bit of everything in their catalogue. This one does it in spades."
1,HOLY GUACOMOLI,"This game is so cool I bought it in summer 2002 and still play it with friends and occasionaly by myself. Great Graphiks, Great story, great (I mean great) guns, this hole game is great. I could play it all day, no all week nonstop. Like everyone I know who has xbox bought this game , or they have gotten xbox for this game. You could not buy this but then u would be missing out. It has great replay value and sound. Surround sound was practically built for this game the sweet sound of stupid aliens running for their lives then they fall down dead is so sweet. Then u go to multiplayer and beat the crud outa ure neighbor or friend or go online with xbconnect.com and kill strangers. THIS GAME ROCKS!!!!BUY IT NOOOOWWWW!!!"
0,Love the product but....,"I love this product, I have been looking for it for a long time and when I found it here I was very happy!! however when I received it I was disapointed of the size and the fact that it was a SAMPLE-NOT FOR INDIVIDUAL SALE!!!I don't mind paying for the product but I would expect to get at least something that is not labeled as SAMPLE!!!"
0,2 Different shows,"I am a big fan of Touched by an Angel. However, this episode can be divded up into two separate programs. The first starring Roma Downey was a 5-star episode. Roma's encounter trying to be a singing star along with her experience in jail, make this worth watching. The second was the part with Charlotte Church, who IMHO is the worst excuse for an actress ever to blaze her way on to the boob tube. If you can overlook this young girl's attempt at acting, you may find the entire episode to be enjoyable. I made this review 1-star because the episode is being sold by Amazon as a Charlotte Church Video. However, it may be better left as a Charlotte Church Video than a Touched by an Angel Video. Could have been a TBAA classic without CC."
1,Outstanding,"What a great scale. My husband and I forgo the ""Hal""-like aspects of this machine, figuring that our weights we would just as soon keep to ourselves. But the documentation that came with the scale persuades us that programming would be a cinch. We've used the scale -- him weekly and me daily -- for about six months now. It stows easily under a shelf in our bathroom and the battery seems to be holding up just fine. The VERY LARGE NUMBERS are a boon for our middle-aged eyes. Like the previous reviewer, I looked at a number of scales, including more expensive ""doctor's office"" type equipment. The more I looked, the more convinced I became of the high quality and good reliability of of Tanita equipment. We're very pleased."
0,Very disapponiting,"Having loved the first season I was extremely disappointed in season 2. The stories are tedious and depressing. The constant argueing is simply irritating - nothing more. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because the characters of Tyra and Lyla are just so good looking that I couldn't completely hate it. Also, I believe, due to he writer's strike the season ended rather abruptly - in a way I was happy about that because I couldn't stand the sight of ""Smash"" anymore nor the near constant stuttering of Matt Saracen and Julie Taylor - I mean give it a break already. Let's hope season 3 is better."
0,I just can't get into it,"Loved Gibran's, The Prophet and bought this book after it was recommended as being similar. I just can't get into it. Sure, its a classic, but it is one of those books that need a study guide. The poetry is overshadowed by Rumi's relationship with another man; Shams. Was this a homosexual relationship? Was that why Rumi's son had Sham killed? Maybe I need to put the book away for a few decades and read it again later."
1,Cher is best than ever!,"She has totally make a comeback. She is going to be on top of the US charts with her album ""believe"" and her next singles because her songs are fun to listen. It was about time that Americans have a change in music taste. Cher as well as Madonna are making those changes now and there will be more artists to follow. We are going to be dancing on the radio for the next millenium and that sounds like fun!"
0,Waste of time and money,This not a book -- more like a promotional pamphlet. It would have been nice if the author had some theoretical basis or logical basis for her arguments. It reads like a series of happy noises and PR.
0,intermatic analog wall timer,"This is one of few remaining choices on the market for analog timers, the particular application required such an option due to the age of the end user, combined with some physical disability issues. The product was replacing a earlier version of the same or similar model which had provided over 30 years of dependable service. this so far has not been the case with this product. In all fairness the model purchased was a refurbished one and this may be the cause of the problem, but the removable dial ratchets out of position causing the timer to fail to activate subsequent on or off commands..."
1,Can't go wrong.....,"Have owned this piece for a couple of years now....is my standby to go with my ""little black dresses"". Have gotten many compliments on it from people who spend 10 times this much for a ""fun"" piece of jewelry. Have had no problems with clasp so far.... (knock on wood!)."
1,A Must Buy!,"I have not listened to the CD in it's entirety... but the few cuts that I've heard were EXCELLENT, SOOTHING, FEELING and RELAXING. She's a very confident and heart touched singer. You get the feeling that she's singing to you in your sitting room. Geat voice.... I can invision Ledisi musically reaching for the sky.DON'T DELAY.... BUY TODAY!"
1,The Best Chinese Song Collection of Teresa Teng,"This 2CD set was originally released in 1987. it has all the most beautiful songs of teresa teng, now it's re-remastered and release the new 2 CDs. The CD looks like LP in 80s. Great sound quality, a lot reminds me when I was teenager the days I listened to all teresa teng...."
0,Lauryn Hill is terrible.,"The Fugees were tight.Lauryn Hill by herself... is not.The unbelievably annoying shrill piano tone melody of Doo-Wop (That Thing) will haunt me for the rest of my days! This album cannot possibly stand the test of time, or any other test for that matter. Don't waste your money. (Or bandwidth)"
0,The Horse is Dead Stop the Beatings!,"I had hopes that this book would be the savings of the Anita Blake series. God, was I wrong. SAVE YOUR MONEY! I'm only 100 pages into the book and it feels like a sentence in Hell. There is NO PLOT and the sex has not only ceased to have a point it just plain old boring. There's no chemistry between the characters. Reading this book I couldn't help feeling that the writer has come to hate what she does and it shows. There are so many other great alpha female supernatural books out there now that are far better written and much cheaper. Save yourself the agony and the money and give up on L.K.H., she's wrung herself dry."
0,hard to enjoy,"The musicians in the JIB, to include Jason himself are all talented. The only problem with this album is how hard the vocals are hard to scrape past. The whining vocals could only be matched by the original whiner himself (whom this album sounds like a watered down version of) Michael W. Be sure that you listen to this one before you buy it."
1,Waterpik W-100 Ultra Dental Water Jet,Works great. I have it set to get under and clean gum lines. I do not use it at its full setting.
1,Categorically Unique,"Exceptional work of unique culinary entree, the amuse-bouche. I've only experienced this several times. Remembering the first and how surprised all of us dining together were to view such small, interesting dish set before. Fun and thrill of eating such a concentrated masterpiece.Apt description of this effort, fun and thrill to peruse and use!Gives one such wealth of creative inputs to not just emulate, but start the creative juices going to concoct one's own and enless serving possibilities.Feast on ""Ricotta Stuffed Rigatoni with Spring-Vegetables and Pesto Oil; Avocado-Peekytoe Crab Salad Ball with Citrus Vinaigrette; Chilled And Grilled Black Mission Figs with Mascarpone Foam and Prosciutto Di Parma; Asian Soba Noodle Fork with Water Chestnuts.You'll see some of this expanded into small desert combos with partner, Gale Gand, in ""Just A Bite.""Fun for the creator, diner and reader! You'll be knocked over by this one! Unique!"
1,Helpful in Trying Times,The book begun with the normal advice that I have often heard but then it became enlightening. I think I have taken a lot away from this book and might reread later on.
0,Print head failed after 10 months,I was very happy with the i-850 during the time that it worked. it was mostly used for text documents during the 10 month period with the occasional photo print. But recently it started printing streaks on photo prints and as of late it just tosses blank pieces of paper (even though I've been only using Canon certified ink tanks since the beginning and the current tanks inside are brand new). My last two printers were also Canons (S750 and a older model from 2000) and had the almost same symptoms.
0,Don't repeat my mistake,"One expects when buying a book by such a respected author to acquire a truly great book. This is not the case with this book. First of all, most photography are of very poor quality. Second, not all pages are numbered! This make the job of identifying fishes a lot harder. I'm very disapointed."
0,Used to love this product.,"I used to love this product. Then about six months ago, La Roche Posay changed the formula. Now there is an ""anti-relapse"" ingredient which wasn't there before. The whole consistency of the product has changed, the way it works changed, and when you begin using it, it no longer effectively spot treats acne. I used to be able to use this product and get results within a day! Now, if I use this product, my acne gets worse. I wish La Roche Posay was still offering their original formula, which was so effective and smelled great."

0,"Decent hardware, horrible software","I have had the WMA11B for over a year now. It is the worst piece of consumer electronics I have purchased in 20 years. The device itself is nice. It is small, connects easily, and sounds good. The PC software on the other hand is pathetic, and even worse, Linksys has essentially abandoned this device. Others have written about XP SP2 problems, but Linksys is clearly over their head in this market. This device only works with obsolete versions of Microsoft .NET. Microsoft has released at least two versions, plus fixes, beyond the version supported by this. The host software also has trouble when you rip new music and add to the managed folders. The Linksys loses track of huge portions of the music folders until you reboot the computer. Very amateurish effort by what otherwise is a decent company. Stay away."
0,I just got this,"I just picked up this cd and have heard her music before in Spanish. It's much better that way and seems to flow easier than in this album. If you haven't heard her music before, I would not recommend this cd. If you like Shakira, though, and want to pick up something worth listening to from her. Get ""Donde estan los Ladrones.""This cd does have one song I liked on the disk ... in Spanish (Suerte). The English counterpart wasn't as pleasing. Overall, if you like her in Spanish, don't get this unless you just want to hear a few good songs."
0,Does not come with label - so it's solid white,"I opened the buoys and I see there's actually no label on the buoy - so it's solid white. Upon further investigation, I see the label is actually sold separately; very strange why they would do that - very misleading on the product."
0,Dangle the carrot,"This book is a fish hook for fools and their money. The smarter you are the less money you have to spend before you figure this out.The infomercial directs you to the book.The book conditions you, directs you to the website and introduces you to Scientology.The website charges you monthly and Scientology is the big kill that empties your accounts.DONT take my word for it. Go do some checking on your own."
0,"Movie is good, format is not","I really like this movie but was extremely disappointed when I watched it and realized that you had to turn the DVD over half way through the movie. I thought that buying a DVD would take away the hassles of two VHS tapes that longer movies have. Also, I have another DVD that is only five minutes shorter and you do not have to turn it over. I was very disappointed at this and would not have bought the DVD if I had known."
0,Work Great - Until it Crashed,"At first the product was fine. However, after about a year of use (stationary next to my PC) the hard drive crashed causing all the data on it to be lost. I'm never buying Maxtor again!"
1,A More Complex Tale for slightly older readers,"A comparison to Hyland's ""Wreck of the Ethie"" is unavoidable since this book uses the details of the 1919 shipwreck (although author Joan Hiatt Harlow sets the disaster in 1912). Differences abound, however, in Harlow's additions of relationship complexities and her drawing class and cultural tensions between various groups of islanders. The book reveals a great deal about life for fishermen on the island of Newfoundland and of the immigrant Irish culture. The book would probably be meant for a slightly older audience than ""Wreck of the Ethie"" because of the various group tensions, but I actually feel the this book does not do as good a job depicting the shipwreck (perhaps because the point of view is solely from the shore rescuers whereas the ""Ethie"" offers both points of view). Excellent cover art and good prose."
1,GREAT CD,"I really enjoyed this CD, but when I bought it, I thought I was getting 24 whole songs. I did not know that nine of those songs were going to be a medley because they are all listed separately.My only complaint is that I didn't get all the songs I was going to get, now I have to buy more CD's to get the full songs."
1,Fun gadget,"I use my eMap for topographical maps. With the 8 Meg of RAM, I am able to download the areas covering the Appalachian Trail from West Virginia to the Southern end in Virgnia. That takes about 4 Meg--plenty of room for other regions as well. Because GPS signals are so weak, the antenna needs to be exposed to the sky to keep a good signal. The flat back of the eMap makes a strip of velcro easy to apply to allow mounting of the unit on the shoulder strap of a backpack. The features aren't as numerous as the Garmin III+, but it covers all the basics and provides a large, crisp screen. I haven't tried the dash mount for my truck, but it looks like it would do well in that environment as well."
1,Fascinating read,"If you like the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, you will love this book! The author is admittedly not a professional writer but that is easily overlooked by the fascinating story he tells. It gives you the feeling that you want to put on your prospecting boots and head for Calumet! I was in a fossil/rock booth at a summer show and was telling the proprietor that he would love the book I had just read by Richard Kellogg. He said ""Hi I am Robert Kellogg - Richard is my brother"". What a small world! I asked him if the story was true and he claimed it was according to his brother. Even if it is not true, it is really a fun read. It is an interesting snapshot of a time that was both intriguing and adventuresome."
0,shipping disaster,"when the telescope arrived at my home, I was excited until I opened the package it was loosely shipped in. The dew shield was split and parts of the scope was falling out of the package it was shipped in. The tripod has a dent in it. I am very unhappy with this situation and no one has contacted me about this so far. I want a new dew shield and a new tripod. I do not care to order anything large if this is what I an going to expect."
1,We need to be reminded of the basics,"I have noticed that many folks are criticizing this book because they feel it doesn't contain new , GROUNDBREAKING ideas. But that's the whole beauty of it. Life doesn't have to be so darn complicated, and a lot of the answer we are all searching for, are contained in the basics. We miss them, because we hurry past themNo one book you ever read is going to make you a millionaire over night, but changing you attitude and habits can create unlimited possibilities."
1,If you are a thomas fan you will love it.,My son loves it because he likes thomas stories they are short and there are 3 or more stories in one dvd. He has a thomas train track and table set. so he totally love and enjoy watching the dvds.
0,this thing is BAD,"i dont know what to do with it. i jus swing it around. then i throw it somewhere. it is really boring. if i were someone else, i would not get it."
1,Good information to have,"I would not use this as a curiculum soley, but I do find the information contained useful."
0,Why?,"I feel strongly compelled to tell people to save their money and pass on this book. I have enjoyed other Dara Joy books on various levels, but I can't bring myself to turn another page. The banal dialogue and adolescence between the main characters is just insulting. Takes me on an unenjoyable trip back to high school. Enough with the ""Baby"" and ""Doc""."
1,Good Fun & Great Resource,"Some books are just fun. You pick them up knowing it will put a smile on your face and you leave it down with that smile on your face.Oxymoronica (Is this a moronic title?) is one of those books.It is difficult to write a lengthy review about this book because it would basically entail repeating many of the wonderful quotes which the author has sourced (and he does source and credit them very well.)The oxymorons range through humor, the human condition, politics, advice and other concepts. I would encourage you to ignore the oxymoronic advice of George Bernard Shaw quoted in this book - ""Never take anybody's advice,"" and read this book.It is a genuine little gem"
1,better than the others...,"well i like the fact that the tines on the comb are rubbery so the little buggers stick to it. What I didnt like was the silver color, you have to hold up to the light everytime to see what you've got or if its just drops of water (works best with very wet hari). This would be a much better product if the color were different, maybe black or white depends if you are getting bugs or the nits.That being said it worked much much better than anything else out there"
1,Wonderful,"Five stars in my opinion. I'm not actually reviewing even though I do think the movie earns five stars. I'm here to say, even though most of you might have realized, Wim Wenders worked on the screen work for City of Angles so that's probably was why some of the scenes in City of Angels were identical to some of the scenes in Wings of Desire."
0,Very Lacking,"First of all, AFI only reconizes English-speaking movies. Classics like ""The Grand Illusion"", ""The Seven Samurai"" or ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" are not on this list, even though they are far more superior to movies like ""Forrest Gump"", ""Dances With Wolves"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". Also, some movies were left off this list that I couldn't understand why. Movies such as ""The Exorcist"", ""Rain Man"", ""Touch Of Evil"" and ""The Lost Weekend"". Still, there are a few movies on the list that truly deserved to be there. I'm not talking about the usual fair such as ""The Godfather"", ""Casablanca"" or ""Lawrence of Arabia"". These movies truly do deserve to be on this list, but movies I wouldn't expect like ""The Manchurian Candidate"", ""Fargo"" and ""A Clockwork Orange"". I hope the AFI puts out another list soon, only with foreign-language pictures and also they take a good long look at what they're selecting."
0,Broken Upon Arrival,"The first bench I received arrived with the teak seat broken in half. I sent it back only to have the replacement broken in the same way. Rather than try again, I fixed it with glue and metal braces underneath. Once I used it though, because the seat edges and slots are not rounded, it is quite uncomfortable. Since I can't return it now, I am stuck with it. Totally not recommended. PS: Made in China."
1,A Helpful Guide,"Ireland's ""Perfecting Your Purpose"" is a much needed, practical guide for those who have an idea of their life's purpose but aren't quite sure how to pursue or ""perfect"" that purpose. Over the course of 40 days, Ireland provides life affirming tips and thought provoking moments of reflection that not only draw you closer to God but also toward accomplishing your life's purpose. His insightful examples and biblical references help to keep you motivated during your 40 day ""Transforming Interval."" A compliment to Rick Warren's ""Purpose Driven Life"", which was written to assist the reader in discovering his/her purpose, Ireland's ""Perfecting Your Purpose"" assists you in advancing and perfecting your God given purpose."
1,A must have if you're working with VS.NET tech preview,"This book was distributed to PDC attendees in Orlando, and had as much solid info in it as the rest of the conference put together. Amazing that it could have been assembled this early in the development cycle.This book is most useful if you have access to the Visual Studio.NET tech preview distributed at PDC. It will also be helpful when the beta is generally available, which Bill Gates says is ""this fall"".Four stars instead of five just because it is rough in spots, almost certainly as a consequence of being rushed into print. But don't think twice about getting it if you are doing serious work with Active Server Pages in VS.NET preview or beta - just do it."
1,Alanis's Best Work,"This amazing CD had the misfortune of being the follow up CD to Alanis Morissette's classic ""Jagged Little Pill"". It is unfortunate because the two CD's sound nothing alike.SFIJ is one of those CD's that I consider to be ahead-of-it's-time. The production by Glen Ballard is amazing and, imo, superior to the work he did on JLP. The Eastern sounds - especially the guitars are hypnotic and work so well with Alanis's lyrics.Hopefully SFIJ will be re-released and re-mastered one day (for it's 10th anniversary perhaps?) as it is the essential CD if you are an Alanis fan...start with JLP if you are a newcomer then come to this. It's one of those few CDs that you can play in years to come and always discover something new.Essential songs:BabaAre You Still MadSympathetic CharacterThe CouchCan't NotI Was HopingOneJoining You"
1,Holy dark Santa!,"This cartoon, while very entertaining, is as dark as can be. Both the music and story line. The immortals in the forest talk about ""when Santa Claus"" dies and whether they should grant him immortality which is neat but it's a little much for kids, perhaps."
1,it's great just not an action movie!!,"if you expect action umm...go watch batman begins or spider-man 1 or 2 or the incredibles ok? because this is just a setting up story movie ok? there's only...1,2 and 3 action scenes i think can't remember."
1,Better than Nothing gold can stay,"This CD is one of the best pop-punk emo albums to come out in the last year. NFG continues to write songs that are common to the typical teen(Relationships&Growing up). Every song on this album is awesome and if you are a fan of Blink, Saves the Day, Fenix Tx you will love this album. Order there other releases from Drive thru records. Give these guys 6 months and all the teenage girls will be jumping on the bandwagon. But thats ok because these guys truly deserve all the props that they have coming to them and are truly one of those bands out there that puts out records that you can listen to from begining to end. Forget that one hit wonder BS."
0,"Crashes, doesn't load up etc etc","I should have read the majority of the reviews before I tried to install this piece of crap. Won't load cab3 files. Won't load, can't play it, no good , piece of crap.If you need to spend as much time looking for and applying fixes and work arounds to make software run then that's just a sign of extremely sloppy production practices. Do they test these before releasing them, what's the story?A very frustrating waste of time and energy.I will not be looking for any Siera products in the near future you can count on that."
0,Double Stroller Difficulty,Cons:Easy of use very very poor.Cheep constructionNot able to use stroller visors when using baby car seat.Front seat tray is very difficult to open and close.Very hard to open and cloths stroller.Pros:Ligth weightDoes not tip with one child in use.Resonable shock absorbption.May not be specific to this stroller but the design of front back is difficult to turn and dangerous in parking lots. Its very hard to see who is comming without putting your little onse in harms way.
1,Great Fun,"Anyone who is an Enix fan will find this game to be satisfying. I never played the original on the PSX, to be honest, I only bought it because it said Square on the cover, but I was pleasantly surprised with the game. The voice acting is decent, the FMVs are pretty awesome, and the gameplay itself is involving. I love the idea of a 2D dungeon crawl with RPG-style fights. I love the Norse Mythology theme, and I love the open ended style of the game. All in all, it's a great distraction from the same old RPG."
1,Seller Support was Excellent,"The order was promptly filled and the item shipped and delivered on time and expeditiously as expected. There was a condition issue which clearly originated with the manufacturer not packing the item properly, which the seller resolved very amicably.I would order again from this seller!"
1,4 out of 5,"For the most part, I agree with the other reviewers, it certainly is an eye opening book. However, roughly 25% of the book does not flow with the theme of the book, especially Chapter 12 by Karl Idsvoog. This belonged in a Marketing 101 text, not here.Interesting about the TWA flight and Sept. 11 info that was available in the UK but of course, not here.Check it out, it's a good read."
1,Great Tigger Book for toddlers,"This book is wonderful. It has great illustrations. The best part is the cover - it is cut and put together like it is 3D! I was even amazed, much less my son! A+++"
0,Didn't do much except make a sticky mess,"I had a lot of aphids/whiteflies in my plants, but these papers didnt catch that many of them, it's almost as if the bugs were too smart to go near the paper and get stuck. I didn't like the design of these, as I always ended up with a bunch of sticky goo on my hands while trying to position them."
0,Terrible Product,"I purchased this product for pc laptop tables for Christmas 2007, it's now January 14, 2008 and one is completely broken and the other doesn't function properly. They are made so cheaply that they are destined not to last. The biggest piece of junk I have ever purchased. DO NOT BUY!!!!!"
1,MINISTRY LIVES!,"The world at large may have forgotten,dismissed or never have known about Ministry as year after year these pioneers were cloned in various ways from pop to rock and then some but I as well as many other die hard fans have not.This new release is not so much a return to form as it is a band in the throes of overcoming-period.I love every inch of Ministry good and bad and have not stopped buying their cd's and never will as long as they continue to make theyre own music theyre way.Bands with this kind of work ethic and creative stamina are just non-exsistent in this day and age.Right on!Bring on another decade of Ministry!!!"
1,Gaiam Balance Ball Chair,"My chiropractor recommended this chair for my lower back problems. Since I spend a lot of time at the computer, and was having trouble standing up after being seated for long periods, this chair was suggested because you can bounce and swing your hips while seated...it works! My sacrialiac joints don't get stiff while seated at the computer anymore."

0,Not Quite Satisfied,"I ordered this book online.When I received it and started to examine the book I had to get some magnifying glasses to see the words. I was disappointed that the words were not the same size (large) as my classmates book. Also, I found out that I needed to order Level 1 of this Spanish book. I really would like to return the book and get the Level 1 that I am using for my class, if that is possible. I would not have ordered this book had I known that the words were so small. If you can help me I really would appreciate. I paid at least $54.00 for this book with CDs. Thank you.Ms. Williams"
1,Tease,"Good splatterpunk containing extremely relevant, current biotech issues, really only dealing with animal rights indirectly. Too bad that We3 only lasts three chapters -- just not quite enough to really explore the themes involved. As a result, a couple of moments Morrison resorts to almost offhand remarks that may come across as preachy and dismissive. While good, the length makes the overall effort seem hasty and leaves the reader desiring more perspectives. Above average artwork; worth reading once or twice."
0,It's only EZ chords,"No where does it say (save for the picture of the book) that this is the EZ version of the songs. All this is really good for is knowing the chord changes and keys of the songs, not fills, solos or runs. This book is great if you are just looking to strum along and sing, but not much else. I wish it would have been stated some place else what this was..."
1,Black Diamonds,Very pretty and clear but looked smaller than I thought a 1/2 ea earring to be so buy the larger size for the extra money. They arrived in a timely manner as the seller promised.
0,There's a reason why punk died...it was terrible,"I laugh every time I hear people proclaim this or that band as ""punk"". That ... music died a long time ago and people still want to milk it. Punk was about bad playing, bad singing, and statement making. The statement made was ""We Suck"". And just as so called ""punk"" bands before them the Hives fit that statement. The singing, if you can call it that is god aweful. The musicianship is non-existant. The length of the cd should tell you about the song craft. The amazing thing is that people are eating this ... up. So if you like garbage than by all means buy this. If you insist on proclaiming punk your music taste at least listen to the source like The Ramones, The Clash,..etc."
0,Pretty weak cd,"This CD was extremely disappointing. I did not really enjoy many of the songs. Juvenile has some other CDs that are much better. My advice is to get 400 degrees or Tha G-Code, instead."
1,Excellent Choice,My father and I put this crib together in about 10 minutes. The assembly is extremly easy. The only bummer was the lever the lifts side up and down on one side was cracked. Its not a big deal we just super glued that one and won't use that side. The crib is so pretty and very sturdy. Everyone who has seen it has said they really like it alot and ask where I got it. I highly recommend it and the price is great as well.
0,Why is this a classic?,"I don't understand. I don't understand, why this has so many great reviews. I have read Frankenstein, I have read Dickens, Wilkie Collins, Hardy. Some of the best Victorian writers and I don't find this book to be that well written. I honestly have to say, I find it so excrutiatingly boring, dull, poorly written that I can't get past forty pages. Frankestein is great! I will die happy knowing that I have never read this hideously boring book!!!"
0,Looking for another book!,I didn't log on to review this book but to search for another. I have to agree with most of the other reviewers. I haven't taken the exam yet because after going over and over this book I have no confidence that I can pass the exam. All the extra fluff was terribly distracting! I couldn't keep track of where he was going most of the time. I passed my MCSE self study in 4 months. So I don't think its just me. I going to try another author.
1,Great author,I have read all three of CJ West's books and they are fast moving thrillers. I know he has a fourth coming out and I can't wait to read it. I love thrillers and they have to hold my attention to keep me going. These books do just that and more. LOVE them.
1,Bright. Likes batteries.,My kids each got one of these. They are very bright and you can even see the beam when it's dark outside or in a dimly lit room.They do use up AAA batteries fairly quickly so I got some rechargeable batteries to use with them.The pocket clip came off one of the two that we have but that didn't stop the laser from functioning.
0,blatant ignorance,"Catholic translations prior to Luther spoke of faith alone at Romans 3:28. Hence, the Nuremberg Bible of 1483 had ""allein durch den glauben,"" while the Italian Bibles of Geneva in 1476 and even 1538 had ""per sola fede."" Luther added the qualifier 'alone'. However, this was neither a complete innovation nor a real falsification, for the translation of the Bible that appeared in 1483 had rendered Galatians 2:16: ""justified only by faith"". Three Italian editions of Scripture (Genoa, 1476; Venice, 1583 and 1546) offered a similar translation. The author is clearly not qualified to give an accurate portrait of biblical historicity. As another reviewer commented, this book is typically appealing to the teenage level 'apologist'."
0,Where did their sense of art go ?!,"I have listened DT since IAW came out, and I have all album they've made. ToT is just a bunch of guys showing off their skills. Compared to IAW & SFAM, they are losing their sense of art."
0,Buy the 1999 edition or another collection of reviews.,The 1999 edition is better because it contains lists at the back of titles by selected directors. Maltin is trying to sell his movie encyclopedia; so he leaves out these lists in the 2000 edition. Maybe you should pay a little more and buy the Video Hound guide.
1,Dine first class even in coach!!!,"Now that so many airlines have cut meal service... Do we really miss that nasty food anyway??? I certainly don't & this is considered a personal item on most airlines ~ so you still get to take your carry on...It's made for one, but you can easy fit enought food for too, since they still have beverage service."
1,Jon Land,"One of his best and I've read them all.Still miss his original hero, which by the way, brought him to the front of the line."
1,A book to bring out the Agnostic in you!,"The book that broke my views on religion. Morrow infuses this book with such witty views and inspired observations that you can forgive him the sometimes rough quality of his narrative. Christians, beware! Morrow has written much on the subject of religion since OBD, but this is his classic opus."
1,A valuable tool for deeper knowledge of first editions,"Bill McBride's other book, ""A Guide to the Identification of First Editions,"" shares the basic methods that individual publishers use for distinguishing first editions from later printings.This is a great companion to that volume. It's also by Bill McBride, and will help you delve much deeper into the finer details of first editions. It lists the ""points of issue"" -- these are the fine details (a typo, binding color, dustjacket detail) that may distinguish the first books printed in a first edition from later ones. Not every book has ""points of issue,"" but for many literary works which do, these differences can make a vast difference in value.It's small, inexpensive and easy to slip in your bag or pocket, perfect for book hunting trips. It's well organized, so upon opening it, you'll find it easy to find the necessary information quickly. Collectors and booksellers alike (I am both) of all experience levels will find it an invaluable tool."
1,Some really nice passages...,"Being always willing to give an industry oriented book a shot, I picked up this entertaining page turner with no preconcieved notions in my head. It was penned by Steven Bochco- the creative force behind TV shows like Hill St. Blues, NYPD Blue, and L.A. Law- and spins a windy tale about a blocked screenwriter, sexual escapades, money, and murder. While the writing is a bit predictable and sluggish at times, and the attempt to come across blunt and gritty just feels forced, its still a fun and entertaining read with a nice touch of dark humor. The narrative is engaging and the twists will make your brain smile. It reads like a decent movie script in need of an editor: fun and full of potential."
0,Foe Gillian Anderson completists only.,"With the exception of the always fantastic performance of Gillian Anderson, The X-Files Movie is a cobbled-together mish-mash of all the WORST aspects of the series: the convoluted conspiracy crap, Mulder's weak quips and Scully reduced to a damsel-in-distress. Pathetic."
1,As Real As It Gets...,"I had heard a lot about Kiki Swinson so I couldn't wait to get my hands on her first novel, Wifey and let me tell you...I was not disappointed. Wifey is as real as it gets when it comes to the wives and girlfriends of drug dealers. I admire Kiki for not glamorizing the hustler's life style and for keeping it real. An amazing writer, Kiki is definitely one to watch in the literary world!"
0,Telling but Lacking,"While the book does explore the personal experiences of those suffering in pain adeptly, the author and contributors fail to include many sides of this complex issue of the way pain in our society is viewed and why it is so. I would say there is a limited scope at best. The book assumes for instance that addiction is a separate disease when in fact many patients in pain have co existing addiction problems past or present which clouds the issues inherent in prescribing opiates obviously. Further, there is growing acceptance currently for the theory that ""disease"" is a term applied to addiction too freely, apparently a trend not limited to outside of this book. Also I note a glaring lack of references. I recall seeing similar discourse and material discussed in several separate magazine articles and web blogs unrelated to this author, pre dating the publishing of this book. Not all original premises but certainly a valiant attempt to have an all inclusive resource."
0,"When they are good, they are very very good but when they go bad, they're horrid!!","I have purchased three of these units. When they work, they are WONDERFIUL. Problem is, they don't work well for long. My first unit worked beautifully for almost a year. I didn't hesitate replacing it with another unit. This one, however, only worked for about 3 months. I didn't have my purchase receipt for warranty repair so I bought yet one more. This time, the unit NEVER worked properly. Each time the unit failed (including the one I just received from Amazon), it was due to the rain guage losing contact with the main unit. Changing batteries, resetting, etc. etc. was to no avail (and VERY annoying because of all the silly little screws). I returned the last unit and will NOT purchase another Oregon Scientific wireless rain guage unless they explicitly address the loss of contact issue."
0,"Attractive, but not durable...","My husband received this ceramic crock as a gift two weeks ago. Last night as he went to lift it by the handle to move it, one of the knobs that the handle attaches to snapped off. We were disappointed but not ultimately suprised as this thing weighs quite a bit. The handle itself is heavy duty but the knobs used to attach it to the crock are just not beefy enough to support the weight of this thing. I called Plow and Hearth and they are giving a full refund to the gift-giver and I am pleased with how they responded.If you want something pretty to keep your scraps in, this is great, just don't pick it up by the handle."
0,Decent Camera for the Novice User,"I got this camera as a Christmas present in 2005 and it's been decent for me for the 2-3 years I've had it.pros:- Easy to Use...pretty much point and click with a no-hassle menu- Cheap/Affordablecons:- The flash is just not very intuitive and I've began turning off the flash because it wears thin on me at social gatherings in dark spots.- Horrible Battery Life...I took this camera on a 2 week trip to Italy and had to insert a pair of Double A batteries every other day (I only took 400-500 shots). The problem is the power usage of the digital screen on the back of the camera. Once that's turned off, the battery life extends to 1-2 weeks sometimes under the same usage as my time in Italy.- A little bit too blocky for users that want something slim.Overall, it's an ok starter camera, but for someone that expects to use a camera quite often, I suggest trying something else."
0,Poor Ticking,I got these about a year ago for a gift. They were quite firm but I figured they would break-in after using them for a while. I put them in pillow protectors before using them. After the first week they had down coming out all over. Little dusty bits and full pcs of down. The more they are used the more dust/down. They are a pain to deal with. I was very unhappy with them. I really wanted a good set of down pillow and this just isn't it.
1,How To Use Friends and Step All Over Them...,"Firstly, I am appalled at the number of reviewers -myself included- who have given this book 5 stars. Appalled because of the dearth of simple ethical behavior. But since I live in the ::::REAL:::: world -as opposed to the happy go lucky fairy tale land of fantasy where people lead ethical lives and do not act out of self-interest- I give this book 5 stars for its brutal honesty."
1,Excellent; very pleased,mower arrived within two days of order. mows cleanly and quietly. performs as i hoped. very happy with my purchase. Maddie
0,"I just found out yesterday that ""Plow"" wasn't by Mike Ness of Social Distortion","When someone buys a full-length album, and grumbles about how it only has one good song on it, this disc is the kind of album they're talking about.Sponge is a fitting name for this band; they absorb and concentrate all their good music into one song. And I swear to God, I actually thought ""Plowed"" was a Social Distortion song until I saw the music video on VH-1 (literally) yesterday for it. No wonder I couldn't figure out why Mike Ness was singing over a power pop ballad. It was an impersonator.I give this album half a star for one good song. It would've gotten a full five stars had ""Plow"" actually been from Social D on an album surrounded by equally-good Social D songs."
1,Thin and tough reflective tape.,"This reflective tape is ultra thin and the adhesive is very good, sticking to smooth and matte finishes well. It is easy to apply and the results look sharp. The reflectivity is on par with road signs (if that's a good comparison). The only knock against it is that the tape isn't 100% consistent in thickness and some of the edges weren't smooth, but that got better further along in the roll."
0,A disappointment,"Unfortunately, this book did not live up to its fascinating premise (time travel through wormholes) and the ""teaser"" synopsis on the back cover. It begins well, and the first 90 pages are excellent hard sci-fi. The book quickly degenerates into a poorly disguised pulpit for radical ""environmentalism"", however, with the hero discovering a model to unfailingly predict catastrophic environmental degradation. The essence of this story is that climate models are always right, and the empiricists are always wrong. The novel contains profound elements of eco-conservatism and a lot of poor science. Among other things, apparently the author didn't know that algae was a plant, and produced oxygen. In sum, I strongly recommend avoiding this book."
1,A real page burner!,"Find out if an emigré Russian mobster turned his wife & home to shishlik for the insurance money. Well worth the read, and one of the best examples of what life is sometimes like for an over achieving insurance adjuster. True in many respects especially the details. Gives respectability to a field that most people only encounter by accident and often come away from that experience with a negative opinion. A negative is one thing this book isn't!"
1,Great upgrade to E2C or any other entry level canalphone!,"I bought these because I found my previous phones, the E2Cs rather annoying to keep in my ear and also because I felt like an upgrade. If you're more of a bass-head, I'd still recommend the E2C. The E4s bass is slightly better defined but just a tad less deep...and I really mean a tad.Overall sound quality is as good as the very MANY online reviews say it is. Not best of class but very musical. If you are listening to music for pleasure (not work), musicality is a good thing. Slightly exaggerated mids clarity and moderately extended (in duration not depth) bass are some of the embellishments.Overall a good buy for the price (175 USD) and it's a good 70 USD cheaper than all the stores in Singapore.Kudos to Shure and Amazon.com!"
1,Lots of information,"This is a good book for entry level open water swimmers. The specific information on swimming in the open water is very good and useful. However, as a professional swim coach, I noticed a large part of the advice on how to swim the freestyle (front crawl) stroke is simply outdated. If you disregard the parts on how to swim freestyle (and instead find a coach to work with you), this book is very, very informative."
0,Terrible mystery wrapped around fascinating facts,"Brown constructs a 3rd rate mystery to carry a boatload of amazingly interesting facts about the early origins of Christianity and the Holy Grail. I wish he would've just written a book on the substance and spared the extremely amateurish and poor writing. I was also irritated to see how much he ripped off ""Foucault's Pendulum"" by Umberto Eco, which was light years ahead of this extremely disappointing book. If you're a fan of fine writing in mysteries, like Alan Furst, you'll be very disappointed in the Da Vinci Code."
0,fell apart after 6 months - no customer service.,"There are wires that run through a hinge from the display to the part that plugs into the lighter. Eventually this plastic hinge wore out. Then the stress of pulling the charger out of the socket broke a wire. I actually took it apart and resoldered the wire, but I believe the electronics were fried when the wire broke loose. I got no support from the manufacturer, who arrogantly said ""you have to just buy another Transdock Micro."" Of course I did not follow their advice. I bought a ""Monster"" this time. Much more robust design."
0,I want my money back,"In addition to a sterilizing bath.What happened to Anita? What is this thing that is being passed off as her? WHY?I have told myself repeatedly to just stop buying these things, yet, keep subjecting myself to them, hoping that somehow it will go back to some semblence of the series. When it was fun, interesting, had actual charactors instead of sexual organs that walk and talk.I am deeply disappointed in this book, and revolted. Not because of the sex but because it wasn't sex. It was as though she thought of the most offensive, unlikable sexual situations gaurenteed to offend, and wrote those down.I'm ashamed I even read the whole thing. That I wasted that time and effort. I'm shocked anyone can make themselves write that they liked it.It was better edited than the last though. I guess that's something."
0,piece of junk,This item is a piece of junk...1sr day we used it it got a hairline spilt up the side of body in which air could escape so pressurizing did not work...had item replaced and new mister came with a crack in the same exact spot while still packaged!! Sent it back asap
0,Dreadful,Here's one baseball movie that should have received a permanent rain delay. It's one of the worst possible experiences a filmgoer can take part in -- a dreadfully unfunny comedy. Avoid this 'major league' disappointment at all costs.
1,An uplifting tale about an American Hero,"This is not only a story about a race horse, it is a lesson in history. The details in this book are so interesting and accurate that everyone will learn something they didn't already know. I must admit that I am a horse lover, but never into horse racing. I have enjoyed this book so much and believe it or not it is very difficult to put down. You will really get pulled into the story, feeling for all of these people (and animals) that really existed and lived this fantastic story. Please buy this book and share it with a friend. It's awesome."
1,Top of The Line,"These speakers are BAD ASS!!! They hit the lows and the highs and every note in between. They sounded great with my onboard audio but when installed a Creative Labs X-fi ExtremeMusic soundcard it took them over the top. Suggest having a good soundcard for the best sound. But after reading some reviews about product defects, I spent the money for a two year replacement warranty from Best Buy. Just in case they tear up. I hope to be cranking these speakers up for years to come. They sound good to me!!"
1,Required reading,"Solid explanation of the foundations of Buddhist practice. Will help you to orientate yourself from the point of view of practice rather than the usual, more common intellectual sutra based study."
1,Very good for the price,"Was able to use his as a replacement monitor for iMac G4 lampshade, just required an easy to make adapter plate & I was off & running. That was the best part."
1,Extremely Helpful.,"What a great, ""no-nonsense"" guide for people who often make presentations in public. This is a ""must-have"" for anyone who works in sales or marketing."
1,&#65533;The perfect&#65533; coffee book,"If you have ever had a cup of coffee - this book is a must!From the history of the first coffee plantation, roasting, brewing, tasting, recipes and even traditions of coffee traders are all mentioned in the well-written book. The writer writes in plain and very humorous English.I'm in the coffee trading business myself, and this is one of the most accurate and interesting books about the whole coffee business as I have read up to now. The book also mentions coffee estates, retailers and roasters by name.A definite 10 out of 10!"
0,Favorite airs and Dances,"I previously bought this record WHEN I HAD A PHONOGRAPH! I do not have a phonograph now, so how am I able to play this album. Secondly I was told the item was in immaculate condition which couldn't be farther from the truth. Th record was scratched and filthy. The record sleeve (Album) was worn and tattered with tears along the side of the album. Finally and most disturbing the actual album was shipped in a USED pizza box!!!!! I will never purchase a used album from Amazon again! I rate this album and entire experience a Minus 5."
0,dissatisfied,inadvertantly bought a greatland stove from target last year and like this butane lantern you will never get to use it . strange a company as big as target can or won't support the equipment they sell.so save your money ive lost mine.
1,Very nice band.,"Definitely worth the price, a very nice band. The only reason the product didn't receive 5 stars is because it was dirty when it arrived. It was easy to clean, so no harm done."
1,"The ""official"" version, but no page numbers, so hard to study with","There is no advantage of this over the free version (Science and Health, with Key to the Scriptures), other than it is the official version released by the Christian Science Publishing Society.Neither this one nor the free one have page numbers (a newer feature for Kindle). Since Science & Health is typically referenced for study by page and line number, plus liner notes in the columns, it's almost impossible to use this version for study. If you want to know what Mrs. Eddy said on line 9, page 319, you will have to really, really dig to find it in either of these two Kindle versions. Not very useful that way, but easy to read as a book."
0,Later cd much better,"Sorry Sue. I loved ""Used Car"" but this one leaves a bit to be desired. Will look for more of your latest music. She has a wonderful voice and all the music on the Used Car cd are good."
1,perfect,Brand new and got it in 2 days. Could not have asked for better service. Thanks for a great job.
1,Good dictionary,My son is in grade 1 and I think that this is a wonderful dictionary for him. He needs a little explaining though but that you have to do first time anyway. 5 stars to them.
1,Fun but challenging!!,"I've heard that you can't get pass the quidditch. Well you can , instaed of following Ron Weasly, turn the other way and you will be led into the dungion whair Professor Snape is and then you go to his classroom."
0,garbage movie,Don't even bother with this film. another attempt to bring a kung fu style fighting together with non impressive non talented actors and martial artists. leave this one on the rack.
1,Deadpool Rocks... just ask my daughter,"OK, so I bought this for my daughter who has grown to love Deadpool as a favorite character in one of her WII games, and loves his comics which she reads on her Kindle Fire. After we received this, she did some research and found that it is actually worth more than is being charged on Amazon (if you find the right collector, of course). She says it is the closest example of what she has read so far in the comics - she has other figures in different sizes that are not what she considers ""authentic"" Deadpool figures. To her, this item was definitely worth the money, and is a good investment to boot."
1,Great Science Show for Kids!,"My son (2.5) loves this DVD. He acts along with the skits and now has a very basic understanding of the forces of motion (force, friction, inertia, and elasticity). Because of this dvd, when he falls or hurts himself, we can discuss what happened and when he realizes there was ""too little friction between his socks and the floor"", he gets excited about knowing what happened and is no longer upset.We bought a 5-pack of Sid DVDs on Woot.com and can't wait to give them to him. As much as I like this particular DVD, I am getting a bit tired of it. I do feel there's a great re-watch-ability to the Sid shows:)"
1,A Pleasure to Drain!,"Just received this pool for my 6 year old son and we absolutely love it! The floor of the pool inflates which is a big plus right there, as it makes draining the pool sooooooo easy. I used to wrestle with the old pool from last year, every night - it took me a good 30 mins to drain the big rectangle monster, had to prop end of pool to get water out and then start bailing with a bucket. NOT this pool - you just pull the floor plug and all the water drains by itself. My son enjoys this pool as well - just getting in to cool off with all of his pool toys - he has a grand old time. Great pool for kids and easy maintenance for parents."
1,Corvette: A Buyers Guide,"Given the small size of the book the detail is excellent and accurate. The book was published in black and white (including illustrations) which limited the identification of Corvette models. For example, the corvette Anniversary model in the 1980's has body colored alloys and a different sort of pillar on the door.The book is very useful if you are wanting to purchase a corvette as it has engine numbers, colours and all details from that date so that you know all the real details of the car.Perhaps the next addition will have colored pictures, considering that most aspects of a car are viewed and it is important to identify the subtle details of a vehicle, especially special features (ie. anniversary cars)."
1,Four enthusiastic paws up,"Beautiful photos, timely and entertaining articles, and a veterinarian's stamp of approval on their health articles. The magazine is a perfect blend of information and fun. Definitely worth a subscription if you are a dog owner!"
0,"Pleasant reading, but not more chatty than scientific","I have enjoyed all of David Crystal's books that I have read. He is an excellent linguist, whom I greatly admire for his ability to communicate effectively to a wide audience of varying linguistic experiences. However, this book is a simple narrative description of a project, not much more than a diary. The linguistic impact of this issue would accommodate one article in some journal, certainly not a whole book. If linguistics is your interest, choose another book."
1,Best original album i've seen in a while,"If you like bands such as radiohead and the vines, you'll love Simple Kid. Simple Kid combines a very original mix of electronics, acoustic/electric guitars, and a somewhat vintage feel to create these 11 awesome sounding tracks. Songs such as ""Truck On"" and ""Kids don't care"" offer a break from your typical ""made for MTV"" music. I DEFINATELY recommend them."
1,I Love this movie!,"I love this movie! I expected a lot of things from this movie when I first picked it up and originality was not one of them. Words cannot tell you how happy I was after watching this film. It's got everything fantasy films these days are lacking; wit, sophistication, adventure, and actors who can actually give their characters depth. Its a wonderful story that leaves you wanting more. Stardust makes me wish that more film makers had the guts to step away from their tried and true Hollywood formulas and try something thats decidedly ""out of the box."" Buy it, you won't regret it."
0,Ian's review,"f-zero is a bad game . do not buy it. it is bad because you can only be 4 racers,you can't unlock any more in the game. the game also only has 10 tracks and they are ALL pretty much the same. so don't buy it."
1,"Great uncut version, great used DVD!","The uncut version is better that the edited version. The quality of the used DVD was almost like new, with no scratches. Thank you!!"
1,One of the finest Christian albums available!,"There are songs on this album that will bring even the most hardened of souls to their knees... King of the Hill brought Christ's last hours to life for me; the pain, the frustration, the triumph. Eli has a gift for writing songs that touch a cord in the Christian soul and his earthy, personal style delivers a powerful message."
0,too many things to go wrong: buy a CORDED or gas model,"First the string didn't release when tapping as hoped. Then the 2nd spool wouldn't even feed out by hand, you have to unscrew it and unwind it every time it needs more string. The spring that goes with the spool gets lost, too, making this necessary.Then if you don't keep it charging, or the ac/dc charger wire gets cut and the trimmer doesn't get charge, it won't recharge. So you then have to replace the charger (if cut) for $30 and/or the lead acid battery (old technology and makes item heavier), for $??Just get a corded model or gas powered."
0,Boring and Irritating!,"This was a very tough book to get through. The first 1/3 of the book was interesting and seemed promising, and then...it just got so awful.There was no plot thickening except at the very beginning and the very end of the book (complete with plot holes!). Throughout the rest of the book, was just a bunch of nonsense to show how bad the bad guys really were and how good the good guys were. At least throw in a couple more plot twists while you're at it.The personal side of the story with the 10 kids and the sick wife was sweet at first, but it was so excessive and sugary it became annoying.The crime is solved mostly by accident. I was hoping SOMEONE (FBI, NYPD, anybody!) would actually use their noggin and make some connections through deductive reasoning, rather than continuing to rely on failed hostage negotiations."
1,BR Bluray Review,"After the Korean copy of the Battle Royale Special Edition, it was refreshing to see the subtitles in sync with the actors and the dialogue making sense! The picture and sound quality was excellent along with the supplements. To have the original and Director's cut along with BR II (not the best sequel around, but watchable) is a big plus! I have only one gripe, although minor, they should not have bothered making a dubbed track of the movie. It was so horrible, it makes the old Godzilla and Gamera voice overs look like they were directed by Kenneth Brannagh! That fact aside, I think you win big with this special edition bluray of Battle Royale!"
0,They can slide on the carpet,"The chair risers are advertised as ""nonskid"" but they can slide on carpet. Bought these for my elderly father who had hip surgery. His chair is in the middle of the room and when he sat down or stood up the chair slid. He uses a walker so it is dangerous for the furniture to move. Also, I did not think the depression at the top of the cone is as deep as it was described. Probably if the chair backed up to a wall or you don't need a walker they would be OK. Even though I had used them the Stander Company said to return them. I bought them through Amazon and the return process was very easy through Amazon."
0,durability issues,"This thing worked great when I first got it. Plugged an old drive to it and my laptop had no problem recognizing it. I loved the idea of having this thing around. Unfortunately, six months later when I needed to use it again, the thing won't power up. It looks like the power cord has gone bad. I'm stuck with a useless ""tool"" that I really liked. Had I pulled it from my shelf 1 month earlier, Amazon would have let me returned it. As it's outside the warranty period, I'm out of luck."
0,Don't buy this - Save $50 and get the Airhogs Havoc. It's EXACTLY the same,"So, I put both this and the Airhogs Havoc on my wishlist for a recent birthday and actually received both of them. I was looking forward to seeing what the difference was that would warrant a $50 difference in price.Well they're both here and they are the same toy from the same manufacturer. They are in the same packaging with the same remote and the same stickers.I don't intend this to be a negative review of the product, as I'm 34 years old and haven't had this much fun with a toy since I was 12. It flies great and is completely addictive.Having said that, it's exactly the same as the Havoc. I even took my Havoc's controller, switched it to the appropriate channel, and it controlled the Picco Z perfectly.I absolutely recommend the helicopter..... just save the $50 and get the Havoc.Good luck!"
1,A superb travel guide,"This book is what travel guides are supposed to be: informative, interesting, and most of all--fun. Great research and the author's warm writing style make planning a leisurely holiday a pleasant experience. Great suggestions for romantic getaways, but there's plenty here for the whole family, if you really want to bring the kids."
0,Jewel is officially a SELLOUT,"This CD is HORRIBLE. It is, by far, the worst CD I have ever purchased. I used to respect Jewel for her earlier works which seperated her from the rest of the cookie cutter pop princesses. Now shes desperately trying to cater to a whole new croud with poppy britney-spears-like songs through the use of her new-founded, blatent sexuality. The only catchy song on this CD is ""Intuition"" and it gets old quickly. Sure, for those who have seen the ""Intuition"" music video, Jewel is making fun of capitalism and advertising agencies who use sex and fame to sell products. But how does she explain turning around and selling that very song to Gillette to promote their new shaving product for women??? Now all we see of Jewel is a 40-year-old women clathed in mini skirts and barely-there bra tops trying to stake a claim in a Britney Spears' market. This CD is horrible. I ALMOST can't blame her for using sex to sell this one."
1,our husband,Very well written .Held my interest and had a little twist to the ending. Would read other books by this author.
0,What's the deal with the price?,"I bought a pair of these on here for 2/14.99 and I thought they were great. Then, I went to buy two more and the price was $99 for a single bowl. I figured it had to be a mistake so I emailed the seller. I never got a reply from them but two days later the price was 14.99 for a single bowl. These are cool bowls but they are not $15 dollars cool. Then the other day, I was at wally world and found these same exact bowls for 3.99. Lesson learned. Shop around."
1,I cannot enjoy any other author any longer!!!,"Diana Gabaldon has pulled off the literary coup that only parrells Stephen King. Once I started ""Outlander"", I couldn't stop until I had read ""Dragonfly in Amber"". Then, after reading both of these books over and over and over...""Voyagers"" finally, finally came out...and after waiting rather impatiently for the ""Drums of Autumnn"" to come out...sigh... it CAME!!! At the bookstore where I purchased my book, all I had to ask was ""Has the Drums of....."" and I received a quick answer of ""No!!!"" ""It's been moved out...again!"" I have a truely difficult enjoying other authors now, they just don't seem to compare.....Thank you Diana Gabaldon"
1,Excellent book,I highly recommend this book. Great images and easy to understand techniques. Shaw is down to earth and obviously speaks from experience. The images alone justify the cost but you will learn from this book.
0,"Lots of text, lots of errors","I read the 3rd edition of this book in preparation for the Java programmers exam - its an old version, but I read it since a colleague had it handy. There's a lot of information in this book, but too much of it is incorrect for my liking. In some sections there are serious errors on nearly every page. If it was a 1st edition book it might be understandable, but how can a book like this get to its third edition with so many mistakes? If you're an experienced Java programmer, you'll probably just laugh at the errors (as I did), but if you really want a book to learn Java to pass the exam, then I suggest you try another one - this book will only confuse you and make things worse."

0,Very Simple,"If I had a ten year old interested in WHY a surfboard is made to look the way it does then this would be the book for him/her. If you want a book that will help you craft a surfboard out of a blank material, the tools, material and tecniques needed, and provide step by step instruction; this isn't the book for you."
0,Easypower Screw Remover Warning,I am a licensed civil engineer. I questioned whether this product would work but read a few comments that indicated it does work.I am sorry I bought it as the concept is fraudulent. This tool does not work in any manner whatsoever. I would like to have my money back if that is possible and recommend that they stop selling this item.
1,An Outsider's Perspective On Hardcore...,"Nowadays, when kids hear the term ""hardcore"" thrown around, they toss around names like Underoath or even worse, Atreyu; these sorts of bands have watered down the hardcore concept to appeal to the larger emo-kid crowd. Raised Fist's newest disc, Sound of the Republic, lends a European's perspective on the changing scene. The Swedish quartet's first album in four years proves to be a worthy sucessor to 2002's Dedication, which reminded us all what hardcore is all about - speed, ferocity, and social awareness. This time around, you can feel more of a metal influence, which only re-enforces their tenacious song writing skills. Most importantly, though, SOTR revives the spirit of old-school hardcore, bands like Sick of It All and Agnostic Front, to remind us that this ""emo-hardcore"" phase is nothing but a passing fad."
1,pastoral care,This book is very informative and well documented. Great addition for anyone in Pastoral Care.
1,Great Book,This book was excellent! You felt like you were really there with Lucy! I recomend this to anyone who loves a good book.
1,Good purchase for the money,"I reviewed strollers, like other mothers, for a few weeks before I decided on this one. I wanted a cheap and well designed stroller for my toddler. We got to the zoo and in airports and malls a lot!!! I like this stroller for almost every reason. It has a really cute look and comfy padding for my son. It folds rather small and quite easily. It's light. My only issues were this: I wish it had a carring srap(it's kinda akward to hold in any such way), the visor could provide better sun coverage(the weather shield would be good to come with it or buy after), and the strap between the legs is just to far back. The part where it meets the fabric to keep it in place is too far back and makes it uncomfordable for an older child. I just took the strap out from the seat and made it a 4-point harness instead. Overall my son loves it. It has bright blue and meets all my needs. The cross bar in the basket doesn't interfear in any way!"
1,"Sophisticated Soul, Indeed!","This album (pardon me, cd!) is one of the priceless ""undiscovered jewels"" in the Motown treasure chest! Wanda Rogers' husky, breathy, sexy vocals are brilliant; even more so when you consider that she and Smokey created this album without much help from the Motown higher echelon (which was more attuned to making Miss Ross a movie star at this point).Ann Bogan (the last Motown hired Marvelette), rivals Wanda with a powerfull performance of her own.Along with ""The Return of the Marvelettes"" (another wonderful Wanda-Smokey project unpromoted into obscurity), Sophisticated Soul is one of the BEST examples of the famed Motown Sound. Buy it today, you won't be dissapointed."
0,not worth it,"This game does play in windows 7, thats about all there is good to it, boring and a waste of time and money, not what i expected."
0,I hate this knife,"I bought this chef knife from thinking about how great Sabatier cutlery was. Wrong!!! Stay away from the Loire line from Sabatier! Be forewarned!Though it says its forged, carbon steel, etc., it behaves like a cheap headache.This knife has given me nothing but problems. It just will NOT keep a sharp edge and getting one on it is no trivial effort if even possible. I have 3 steels, a knife sharpening stone block, a Chef's Choice electrical sharpener and they all, to a tee, cannot get an edge on this crazy knife. God knows I've tried. I know my knives too because I own 3 Globals, 2 Wustoffs, 2 Shun Pros and several Calphalon knives - which I think certain Calphalon knives are far, far better. It's not always the co$t of an item. (I like trying out stuff.) This knife is just a plain loser."

0,Not Good.,Product never worked. The process for return was also not through the supplier even though the item had just been bought. I had to contact microsoft and go through a warranty replacement. Will not buy again.
0,It works!,"This is a pretty simple timer. It's plastic, you turn it to the time and it rings when it's done. It feels cheaply constructed. Setting the time can take some fidgeting with the thing. In the end, it works though. If you like the novelty of the chicken timer, get it. If you want a real kitchen timer, get something else."
1,Excellent!,"Some of the reviews I've heard and read here and elsewhere contain criticism of Mr Selengut's journalistic style, grammar, spelling and even the relatively amateur way the book appears to have been typeset. SO WHAT?! If you are prepared to follow his easy-to-follow advice; to pay attention to the detail and to do your own individual stock research, it's worthwhile. I read the book twice and highlighted the most important points the second time around. In three and a half months, I have realized profits of $44,176 and unrealized net gains of $7,509. Not bad for an investment of a little time every day and under [$$$] for the book!"
0,Pretty Weak Tips,"I'd have to agree with the denigrators and I'm basically a novice. You could save the $30 and just goof around with the program for a couple of weeks and you'd have most of what's in here under your belt. Annoying editorial voice that thinks it's much more clever than it really is to boot. It would be a good book for the toilet in a design studio, however. Which is where I suspect the majority of copies will wind up."
0,Broke on Second Use,"Mine broke on the second use. The part of the handle that screws into the claw bent at a weird angle, and I wasn't even lifting a particularly large log, either. What's worse is that I spent about twenty minutes on hold at the seller, left a message finally, and never heard from them again."
1,I didn't find it dry,"Two reviews called this book ""dry"" or ""sterile,"" but I don't agree. It is concise and clear, without bells or whistles in the prose, but I found it elegant and even fun. It talks both about the math itself and about which points children often struggle with, and includes many thoughtful activities. I can tell it has been refined over long experience."
0,Not Historical Fiction,"This book was recommended to me as ""historical fiction"". Fiction is a perfect description, but historical is but a loose term used to describe this book. The few chapters I could tolerate were well written, however, I felt deceived in that the book was described as historical fiction, and I expect with historical fiction that the story is based mostly on fact. As far as I know, there was no place called ""The Fair Isle"" where women lived as ""witches"", in this time period or any other. That is the stuff of Arthurian Legend, and I was not under the impression that this work of ""historical fiction"" had legend and lore included in it. I don't mean to nit pick, but I was expecting a work of fiction based on fact, not legend. If you are looking for a good novel based on fact, try Sharan Newman, Sharon Kay Penman or Ken Follet."
0,Deserves ZERO Stars!,"This Men's MLB Hanshin by Red Jacket is a disgrace: PLASTIC zipper, ugly graphics, cheap material and all. I cannot believe anyone ever paid $74.99 for it. I sent it back the day it arrived."
0,Disappointed in Connecticut,"After reading the reviews on this machine, most of which were positive, I ordered the model 7950. When it arrived, we took it out of the box and put it together...and nothing happened. The motor was working, but nothing else. It wouldn't spray any solution, nor would it take up anything. It just made noise. I have since returned it. I am very disappointed because I was really looking forward to using this machine. Thank you to Amazon for being understanding and making the return process so easy. Maybe if I could get one that works....."
1,Working For The Nazi's,"The book ""The Holocaust Survivors"" is mainly about how interviewers ask some of the survivors what it was like to be in the Holocaust. Many of the survivors said that it was very tragic to see some of their family members being shot, for some unknown reason or dieing, or from starvation. I thought this book was a great book on the Holocaust during World War II. The book also taught me more facts on what happened to the survivors. I would recommend this book to anyone that wants to learn more about the Holocaust."
1,Pretty Darn Good,This is unlike anything I have ever heard him do. He shows that he can cross genres and still make a mark. It is such a pleasant surprise. I would highy recommend this album to someone needing to see a new side of Boy. Buy it!
0,The worst book I've read this year,"I have read a lot of DS books and this is the worst one yet. It was repetitive; the story was totally mundane, not even a little bit intriguing and the ending predictable. I read it to the end hoping it was going to get better but it never did. For a writer of her caliber and reputation she ought to know better. The only good point - it didn't take long to read. This is the last DS book I'll ever buy."
0,Bought 2 CD's-Received 1,"Considering returning this. Can't tell you about the movie because we don't have the whole set to show the class. Have sent several messages to ""customer service"" and have been soundly ignored.Seriously disappointing experience."
1,Makoce Wakan,"I first heard Red Thunder with my grandchildren on PBS. It was the most beautiful, spiritual music I had heard in a long time. I fell in love with their music and I pray to CREATOR that they will continue to grow in their songs. I am getting this CD for a grandson who has heard my CD, and has a birthday coming up in two weeks."
1,Great Buy!,This was a birthday gift for my daughter...a huge fan of X-Files. Didn't take her and her fiance long to watch every episode.
0,Didn't do the trick,"I was hoping to alleviate the pain in my wrist and conserve some desktop real estate. I tried it out for a while and it did neither. The bridge just became more of an annoyance than a solution. Of course, everyone is different, so this my work out for someone else."
0,Disappointment,"I do not know how great the workouts are. I purchased this DVD not too long ago. Unfirtunately, it never worked. It was an extreme disappointment."
1,Prose as Poetry,"The pure information about the nature of forest fires, smoke jumpers and how to try and piece together what happened over twenty years after the fact all are compelling reasons to read this book. I offer another: the prose. Maclean writes in a almost poetic fashion. His prose is rich and vivid. I found myself reading further just to see how Maclean would spin the yarn, with only tangential interest in the story at times."
0,This Series is Trash,"This book, the DVD and the whole principle behind it is junk, and the authors are the only ones getting rich."
0,Didn't work for me either,"I had one of these once and had the same problem of the pieces not fitting together....Despite it's looks, it was terrible....I returned mine..."
0,Only good for mixing a cake!,"This is a honey if all you want to do is make a simple cake mix. I tried creaming butter and sugar and all it does is sling everything to the sides! Thank goodness I had just bought a Kitchenaid hand mixer, I finished up my cookie dough with that and it handled that with ease! Don't bother with this one, save up for a Kitchenaid stand mixer, that's what I'm going to do!!"
1,Good introduction to the study of theology,"Very simply and concisely, Thiessen presents the major concepts of theology. For a more in depth study, I would recommend ""Systematic Theology"" by Augustus H. Strong. This is also available through Amazon. However, if one is only looking for a good and general overview of theology, Thiessen's book is the one."
0,streets and trips stinks,"This program stinks. you need to enter a new starting point every time you use it even though most people start from the same point usualy. The user friendly aspect is poor, the maps are only so so. I found much older products to be much easier and smarter. I bet whoever designed this product doesn't actualy use it!"
0,Disappointed,"This is supposed to have complete series. There are 8 episodes missing. They say 67 is the series,but 75 is the whole series. What happened to the missing 8."
0,A disappointment,"Much of what Tetlock writes about is trivially obvious - why anyone would believe that political ""experts"" actually are experts is a mystery in itself. I expected a more polemical and combative work designed to destroy the obvious sham value of ""expert"" political opinion. I couldn't even be bothered finishing the book it was so tedious. This is not to say that others might be excited by Tetlock's insights.Peter HaggstromBONDI BEACH AUSTRALIA"
1,personal history,"This book is among the best I have read for Illinois history. I was looking for a focus on the life of women, at a certain time and place. This book provided all three: written by a woman, late nineteenth century and central Illinois. It is believeable and detailed.The writing style was clear and easy to read. It makes a good reference in my library."
0,Well...,"...a good story, decent acting, some harsh subject matters, but none that I haven't seen before (I'm from Europe, we're more used to be shown the ugly and nasty aspects of life in movies devoid of any glitter), but it nevertheless failed in holding my attention. The two stars goes to the writer/director for daring making a movie like this. Wouldn't recommend it, wouldn't not recommend it."
1,The basics about multi-family properties,"This book is very informative if you are a beginner to the multi family world. For anyone that has already dealt with multi family, then you do not need this book. However, Berges other book, real estate finance is a good review for the seasoned apartment owner. In that book he goes over some key performance and efficiency ratios that everyone should be aware of when dealing with multi family properties.The book covers the general ideas behind multi family properties but of course it will differ by region slightly. The cap rates that he speaks of are not available in say california but might be available in indiana. Overall a good book for beginners to intermediate but definitely not seasoned investors."
1,This should allways be a reminder of our fathers sacrifices,I could not put it down. I really liked the book. I meet Mr. McDole and his wife this last June. What an amazing family and how he over came tragidy.
0,Why not a true boxed set?,"While the quality is decent I dont see why they just dont release this as a complet box set in the order these movies came out.1. The Egg and I (1947)2. Feudin', Fussin' and A-Fightin' (1948)3. Ma and Pa Kettle (1949)aka ""The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle""4. Ma and Pa Kettle Go to Town (1950)5. Ma and Pa Kettle Back on the Farm (1951)6. Ma and Pa Kettle at the Fair (1952)aka ""Ma and Pa Kettle at the County Fair""7. Ma and Pa Kettle on Vacation (1953)aka ""Ma and Pa Kettle Go to Paris""aka ""Ma and Pa Kettle Hit the Road""8.

The Kettles on Old MacDonald's Farm (1957)(Without Percy Kilbride)Now if they released it like this I would be happy, as it is now it is a far cry from being a good set."
1,Amplified Bible is better than the NIV!,"I've been reading the Amplified Bible for about 2 weeks. It's excellent! I think it's so much better than the NIV in clarity. It's more difficult to read because the sentences are choppy because it has meanings right next to certain words for clarity. But after 2 weeks of reading the Amplified version, I got the hang of it. If you're tired of NIV, check out the Amplified!"
1,Inexplicably underrated--one of their best,"Routinely named as the Beatles' worst album, this is in fact one of my favorites, and I believe one of their best. The Beatles put aside the sound of their first three albums and instead go for a sort of country-rock sound, a few years before Buffalo Springfield, the Byrds, and Dylan do it. How can you go wrong with an album that includes ""No Reply"", ""I'm A Loser"", ""Eight Days A Week"", ""I Don't Want To Spoil The Party"" and ""What You're Doing""? The covers are more numerous and not as good as on other albums, perhaps, but hey, ""Rock and Roll Music"" and ""Words Of Love"" do it for me. Give this album a chance!"
0,Because It Kept Me Reading,"I really did not like this book at all. I typically enjoy King's books, however, the story is true to the title, The Loooooooooooooong Walk, felt like a longer read. I gave it two stars because I wanted to know what was going to happen and I was disappointed! I read the ending a couple of times and I am not sure how I am supposed to interpret it exactly. It just suddenly stopped. I don't want to spoil the ending, but can somebody help me with this?"
1,THESE..............................are spirit fingers!!!!!!!,"Way to go!!! Ready??? Ok!!!I grew up watching my sister make up her own cheers for school. She was head cheerleader for many years. She always told me that it was very very hard work, but she made it look easy. She would go to competitions and would come back winning just about every time.Anyway, about the movie, it is good to finally see a cheer-leader movie that focuses on, well, cheering!!! Dunst is a very wise choice on the lead and all to the other actors just work in around her. The chants and stunts are just remarkable as well as the story line itself.I feel that it is a real crowd pleaser, over all. It is full of good looking guys, and sassy women!!! It is a ""booster"" for all the cheerleaders around the world."
0,There's more than one with this title & I didnt get the one described,"I got the wrong book - not the one pictured. It was a Hallmark Book also, but not by Mary Burrows. It was not a children's book."
1,"pretty good, not the best ive heard..","I had this cd a while ago when it first came out. The track ""my house"" by osheen is still phat! i live in boston area where he spins and i heard him at club Axis broadcasting on the air with Spin Cycle.. he a dope dj! his mixes live were phat.. keep it up osheen! dj Digital.."
0,Horrible. Completely dissatisfied with purchase.,"tried over and over again to get to sync with the ps3, but nothing ever happened. complete waste of money for this product i'll never get back. should've just bought the song brand remote"
1,I LOVE My Kindle!,"I received my Kindle for my birthday. I was excited when I opened it, but I couldn't anticipate just how much I would like using it. It's thinner than a paperback, so I can carry it in my purse, ready for unexpected down time, like waiting in a doctor's office. The screen reads like print on paper, not a computer screen so it's easy on the eyes and can be read outdoors with no problem. It's very easy to use and books download in a matter of seconds. It will be perfect for travel. After having it for a month, I wouldn't give it up for anything."
1,Sounds better than I hear it live!,"I Recorded a little rudimentary snare drumming with the SM57, and with my pork pie snare, I hear it live with a lot of ring and overtone. However, on the recording, the drum sounds as clean as I have ever heard it! It really amazed me how great of a sound was produced out of these microphones!The SM 57's also work great with amps and insturments.The Beta-52 provides a great punch as well.The only complaint i have are the clips. They hook on to boom cymbal stands as well as drums, but they are hard to position on drums. If put on a cymbal stand, the mic rattles a little in the recording.Other than that, these mics are awesome. I gave this 5 stars because the quality of the mics out do the irratating clips.You will not find a better mic kit for this price."
1,The Birth Of Grunge?,"Sure, the recording's not perfect, but there's no denying the energy here. For a band usually associated with crispness and precision, it's refreshing to hear Tull let their hair down (and boy did they have hair in those days!), crank the amps to 11 and let 'er rip!I too wish that live Tull recordings would retain Ian's often hilarious between-songs patter, as this as is integral to a Tull show as the musical virtuosity and visual humour.Nonetheless, this album is a lot of fun. Also recommended is the ""Message to Love"" Isle of Wight film--a hilarious counterpart to ""Peace and Love"" Woodstock--hippies gone bad!!"
1,Asskickin' Underground Fun,"Well now - this is what underground film was meant to be like. Lot's of blood, lots of gore and knife fights, and a few heads rollin'. The Trailer for ""Chunkblower"" is a must see."
1,"Finally, Knives that really work without spending a fortune...","The Anolon Brunello knives are really nice. Not only do they cut well, they look great on the counter. Most knife sets come with black handles and I did not want that look. These knives are beautiful and cut through most everything with ease. I am thrilled with my purchase and I felt that the price of these knives were comparable to other name brands. We were also impressed because the knives are made in Germany of forged steel, all one piece. What a great Christmas gift with all the holiday cooking we did!!"
1,Good stainless canning set,"I already have the red plastic canning kit - this is a great upgrade. It's a good and very complete canning set. The stainless steel is easier to clean and sterilize. Love the funnel with its filter insert. I love the lid holder. And the added natural cheesecloth was great, too. Like the other reviewer stated, the canning rack is huge. You'd need a full-sized pot to make it work, so if you're getting this what that item in mind, be aware."
0,Grrrr...,"Love the author but a frustrating book.....it just went on and on. It drove me crazy. I can't start a book and not finish it, so I trudged on and felt like I had wasted my time."
1,Navigator stands out now!,"This grill is awesome! My Navigator went from plain to chromed out with this sucker! It is super easy to install. Only issue is it is flat and most grill front aren't so it wings up some on the sides especially the bottom part, I can't crank it down tighter for fear I will break the original grill up but you don't notice it unless you are close up. Also, my hood no longer stays up on it's own because of the weight of this. I have had no over heating issues, the temp gauge showed no hotter than without it. I am so happy I bought this!"
1,Just as good as before.,"I haven't seen this movie in over 12 years and bought it to replace the VHS version I previously owned as well as watch it with my husband who had not previously seen it. Although I had viewed it several times in the past and remembered many lines by heart, it was just as good as I remembered it! I am happy to add it to our collection!"
0,"ugh, another disappointing big snake movie!","Python is probably one of the worst ""attack of the killer snake"" type movies ever. The biggest problem I had is that after an hour, only ONE appearance by the gigantic king-size snake occurs! The rest of that time is occupied with crappy and irrelevant dialogue mainly involving pointless chit chat between members of the police department. When I say pointless I really mean it- you won't care about anything they have to say at *all*, I promise. At least the last 30 minutes are saved thanks to the killer snake slithering through an underground facility, chasing teens and killing them one by one. This is the reason the movie gets 2 stars out of me. Everything else about the movie is forgettable, boring and excessively dialogue-heavy."
1,One breathtaking video,"As a wildlife researcher for over 17 years I spent many hours in the field working specifically with wood warblers. I can say with confidence that this is the most breathtaking footage on North American warblers I have ever seen. With close-up gorgeous photography and audio that gives you the feeling that you are right in the the field yourself, this video should not be missed. I have literally watched this video dozens of times and still have not grown tired of it. Even if you are a beginner to the facinating sport of birding you are bound to be captivated at the close-up views and beautiful songs of these ""butterflies of the bird world""."
0,Not so much,"The author is incredibly talented and relates her traumatic experiences in a matter-of-fact manner that makes this book incredibly disturbing. In truth, I could not read more than the first three chapters or so because it was so painful to learn of her experiences. Perhaps I am simply to faint of heart, but wanted to submit this review in case there is someone out there who might have the same disposition."
1,Harry Potter Luver,I have read only the first 2 books and i am only 12. I enjoys them sooooo much I can not put the book down. U have to read it! Even see the movie! Another book set to read is THE LORD OF THE RINGS. I cant put that book down ether!
1,Indescribably Awesome,"There's just something about Animal Crossing (Wild World) that rules, but I can't place my finger on any one ""thing"". I highly recommend this ""to a friend"" lols."
0,It's sad when good authors aren't edited,"Oh Chris Bojhalian, your fans must mourn! A good idea, a well-set up plot, but why did you let them rush you to publication? Three-quarters of this book reads like a first draft - overwritten, with more extraneous ideas crammed into a sentence than it needs in a whole page. Explaining the same things over and over, not as drama building hints, but disrespecting your readers' intelligence. We can make the connections ourselves, we can remember what you wrote last chapter. I am sorry I paid money for this book - sorry it is taking up space in my house. If only it had been edited it might actually have been enjoyable to read!"
0,Delonghi DCM485 Thermal Coffee Maker,"First let me state that this coffee maker makes the best cup of coffee I have ever had. Now for the cons. I bought mine from ebay at a good price. The first one lasted about 2 months before it went dead. Push the brew button twice and nothing happens. Kept trying, unpluged, let set, waited 24hrs hoping it would reset. Not so, and I tossed it in the garbage and went to ebay and bought another at a good price. By the way both were used. Anyway plugged the seconed one in and it was loaded with scale. So I run two cycles with vinigar as stated in the manual. Water was clean so I proceeded to brew a pot of coffee. Guess what, dead. Would not start to brew. I have emailed the company 2 times with no answere. In the meantime I had purchased new set of filters for around $30, so I had a pretty good investment so far. I am still waiting for a reponce from my emails. I still like the features of this model and if ou can get it cheap enough, try it out. Good luck."
1,"Fabulous, useful and informative","This book is amazing. I have an undergad in English and worked as a writer/editor for a magazine for a number of years, and yet this book taught me things that I had never learned elsewhere. Anyone who wants to improve his/her language skills and avoid common mis-uses of words should read this short book and re-read it about once per year."
1,good,this is a great book i got it at a secondhand store for 2bux and i was so stroked cuz my bro used to collect these and this was the only one that he didnt have but i got it first haha.anyways its hilarious so buy it!!!!
0,"As of 15 Nov, I have not recieved the book.","I have no idea what is going on,but as of today I have not recieved the book. Maybe I would have better luk with another bookseller."
0,Great read if you're under 16!,"Having been born in the same place and year as the author, I thought we might have something in common, but it seems his writing ability developed (and remained) in adolescence. Any sucess of this book is a frightening reflection on the interests and intellect of today's readers!"
0,"Good suction but Cheap, Breakable plastic","Have had my DC-07 for 2 1/2 years. I am satisfied with the vacuum but completely dissatisfied with the plastic unit. The handle cracked. I barely used the handle since I felt it wasn't strong enough to move such a heavy unit around. Of course even with the little use, it did crack and the company is charging $60 (10% of the unit value) to replace something that never should have been used in the 1st place, since it was out of warranty.In addition, the plastic attachment that holds the extender cracked.I should have followed the leads from others that wrote of similar problems. I invested in this unit thinking it would last me at least 10 years. With the breaks and the cracks, it will barely get through 3."
1,Enjoyed this book,I enjoyed reading this book. There were many suggestions to promoting a web site - some of which I followed. One big mistake I made was using a list from Imediafax. I agree with the previous writer. Their data is way out of date. The most valuable information I learned is how to properly write a press release. This book shows you step-by-step how to create a press release and e-mail it out. I had a lot of success with mine.
1,A Unique & Disturbing Film,"This film got a good share of publicity when it was released. The story certainly was different. After a lot of people watched the film and the subseqent VHS, I noticed a lot of people annoyed at Jodie Foster's character in the movie, a woman who uttered constantly incoherent phrases. It became aggravating to some. I didn't find that on the first viewing but I admit, it did on the second and third.The point is, if you haven't the film, check it out, but it may not be one you'd want to see multiple times. Then again.......Liam Neeson played a no-nonsense good guy. His wife, Natasha Richardson, who tragically died just a week ago, also adds to this unique story. I don't want to say more in fear of spoiling the story, but kudos to Foster for an outstanding effort. It's a movie you won't forget."
